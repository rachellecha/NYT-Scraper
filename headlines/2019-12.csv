"Italians Celebrate Their Coffee and Want the World to Do So, Too",2019-12-03,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['What do Chinese acupuncture, Irish hurling and the polyphonic singing of the Aka Pygmies of Central Africa have in common? They are all examples of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity that UNESCO has recognized since it began anointing such things in 2003, racking up more than 500 different practices and traditions so far. Italy now hopes to inscribe yet another custom to that list: Italian espresso. “We know very well how important coffee is to Italians, to Italians living abroad and to people around the world who have learned to appreciate something that is also a ritual and an occasion for encounter” and the dissemination of culture, said Maria Chiara Gadda, a lawmaker with Italia Viva, who spoke at a media launch of the coffee campaign in Rome on Tuesday. Italians do love their coffee. According to the Italian Coffee Committee, a trade group, there are more than 800 coffee roasters in Italy, and more than 150,000 cafes that make espresso. In 2018, Italians consumed 5.9 kilos, or 13 pounds, of coffee per capita. But traditional Italian espresso is not just any coffee. “It’s the only coffee in the world that has a cream,” said Giorgio Caballini di Sassoferrato, the founder and president of the consortium sponsoring the candidacy. Turkish coffee, which made the list produced by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in 2013, is boiled three times, he explained. American coffee is percolated through a filter, while in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland (which tops the European list for coffee consumption per capita, he noted) coffee is lightly toasted and consumed at the dinner table, “like a beverage.” “Other products don’t have cream,” Mr. Caballini di Sassoferrato said. That’s not nothing. Espresso cream, as per the regulations drafted by the consortium, “must be uniform and persistent for at least 120 seconds from the time the coffee has been dispensed without stirring,” according to a news release. The cream, according to the regulations, must also be “consistent, a dark hazel color, with light streaks.” To be traditional, espresso must also be made using a bar coffee machine, by a trained ‘‘barista,’’ or cafe operator. The coffee must be freshly ground, and brewed for 20 to 27 seconds.  There are also regulations regarding the type of cup (porcelain with a narrow bottom), amount of coffee in the cup (between 13 and 26 grams) and its temperature, between 90 and 96 degrees Celsius. Stove top Moka espresso machines and coffee capsules do not count. “We have nothing against capsules,” Mr. Caballini di Sassoferrato said. “We aren’t against any type of coffee, we are for our method.” Though the consortium was founded only in 2014, the Italian affair with coffee dates back centuries, of course. Venetian merchants began to trade in coffee beans in the 17th century (some historians believe a century earlier), and by 1750 coffee shops had become so popular in Venice that Carlo Goldoni wrote a popular comedy about one, “The Coffee House.” Their popularity spread. “I can assure you that it if weren’t for Italian espresso and the social ritual of espresso coffee, Italy wouldn’t exist as we know it,” said Massimo Cerulo, a sociologist at the Università degli Studi di Perugia. “We cannot separate espresso the drink from the social ritual, because it is a routine, a socially shared practice.” Coffee was also a harbinger of democracy. “The public sphere as we know it was born in coffeehouses,” he noted, adding that Italy had some of the world’s oldest and most beautiful coffeehouses, like Venice’s “Florian,” Turin’s “Al Bicherin,” or Rome’s “Antico Caffe Greco,” which all opened in the 18th century.  “Around a cup of espresso you have the possibility of meeting many people, regardless of status, class, wealth, political ideas,’’ he said. ‘‘It creates a community.”  Luca Fabbri, a consultant for the consortium, noted that the regulations developed by the consortium had already improved the national coffee culture.  “Even if we don’t get the UNESCO recognition, we’ve already hit the jackpot because the Italian coffee sector is united,” he said. Last year, Italy was one of eight countries recognized by UNESCO for the art of dry stone walling. And in 2017, the United Nations organization gave a nod to Neapolitan pizza makers. Tuesday’s media launch was held at the Chamber of Deputies in Rome, and was attended by a half dozen members of Parliament from parties in the majority and in the opposition, a rare moment of concord that was repeatedly commented on by those present. “The best coffee in the world is Italian so it has the support of everyone,” said Filippo Gallinella of the Five Star Movement.  They joked that the Chamber’s snack bar — known as the ‘‘buvette’’ — was the only place in Parliament where political brawls rarely broke out. Ms. Gadda added that the staff there could use a refresher course on how to make good espresso. The candidacy now has a series of UNESCO loops and committees to jump through before a decision is taken, possibly next year. The only problem was the ill-timed news that on Monday a group in Naples had held a symposium, part of a campaign to inscribe Neapolitan espresso coffee, which has its own traditions, on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list. Mr. Caballini di Sassoferrato said that in the past he had unsuccessfully tried to reach out to the Neapolitans, who started their campaign after the consortium did. “We were caught off guard, but I wish them luck,” he said. Francesco Emilio Borrelli, a Green party member of the Campania regional assembly and the president of the region’s UNESCO commission who spearheaded the Neapolitan campaign, denied knowing about the consortium’s bid.  Instead, he found it suspicious that the consortium had called a news conference the day after the symposium’s event. “That’s quite the coincidence,” he noted dryly in a telephone interview. But Mr. Borrelli held out an olive branch, saying he would try to contact the consortium, “so we can meet and unite forces.” “Teamwork is important,’’ he said. “The only thing we shouldn’t do is lose time.” ']",Italy wants traditional Italian espresso to be inscribed on UNESCO’s list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
"From a Russian Banker, a $4 Million Mansion and a 200-Foot Yacht",2019-12-03,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — The video opens with a plaque on a bench in New York’s Central Park: “Don’t forget we are of the same blood. I LOVE YOU.” The apparent Russian-taxpayer-funded romance behind the plaque, as documented by the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny in a 29-minute video posted online on Monday, has become Russia’s latest viral story about the ruling elite’s intermingling of public funds with personal pleasure.  A reporter for Russian state television, Nailya Asker-Zade, has long been dating Andrey L. Kostin, the chairman of Russia’s second-largest bank, the government-owned VTB, according to Russian news reports. In the video, Mr. Navalny accuses Mr. Kostin of showering Ms. Asker-Zade with gifts so lavish that they seemingly could only have been paid for out of government coffers —\xa0a $4 million mansion, a 200-foot yacht and $470,000 in private jet flights in one month alone.  Ms. Asker-Zade, for her part, contributed at least $10,000 to the Central Park Conservancy, according to the organization’s 2015 annual report. That contribution — the minimum threshold in Central Park’s Adopt-a-Bench program — appears to have paid for the plaque highlighted by Mr. Navalny, which says it is for “Andrey Kostin” from “Nailya.”  “Putin’s rule means shamelessness and degradation,” Mr. Navalny intones at the end of the video, which is produced in his populist, mocking and fast-paced style. “Each of us must do our own small part to fight it.”  By Tuesday, about 24 hours after Mr. Navalny posted it, the video had risen close to the top of YouTube’s Russian “trending” list and drawn more than 2.5 million views — a success even by Mr. Navalny’s standards. His clips documenting official corruption regularly draw audiences in the millions.  VTB did not respond to a request for comment on the video. Ms. Asker-Zade, in an Instagram post, thanked Mr. Navalny for the “native advertisement.”  YouTube and most other popular platforms remain freely accessible in Russia. But Mr. Navalny published the video on the same day that Mr. Putin signed legislation that augurs a further clampdown on freedom of speech: a law that allows Moscow to declare as “foreign agents” people who publish anything online while receiving funding from abroad.  “If you get a dollar from ad monetization on YouTube, you’re a foreign agent!” a popular Russian blogger, Aleksandr Gorbunov, wrote on Twitter. “If you donate more than $10,000 to New York’s Central Park, you’re a Russian patriot!” Mr. Navalny is Mr. Putin’s loudest domestic critic, with a nationwide network of supporters that has allowed him to stage coordinated street protests across the country. His slickly produced videos speak to Russians’ anger about inequality and hypocritical, thieving officialdom. He interspersed his tally of Ms. Asker-Zade’s wealth with Russian state television reports soliciting donations for children in need of expensive medical care.  Polls show Russians’ dissatisfaction with Mr. Putin rising over the last year and a half, and flash points of protest have popped up across the country. In one apparent sign of the Kremlin’s nervousness, the authorities have raised the pressure on Mr. Navalny’s network in large-scale raids and searches in recent months.  “We don’t know about this investigation,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Monday when asked about Mr. Navalny’s video. “As a result, we can’t comment on it at all.”  The government-run news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass published articles on Mr. Peskov’s response, Google search results show. By Tuesday, those articles were no longer accessible on the agencies’ websites.

"North Korea Touts New Resort, Seeking to Blunt U.N. Sanctions",2019-12-03,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Tuesday that its leader, Kim Jong-un, had opened a new mountain resort this week, calling it “an epitome of modern civilization,” as the isolated country tries to attract more foreign tourists to blunt the pain of international sanctions. Mr. Kim attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Township of Samjiyon County, near the North’s central border with China, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported on Tuesday.  Celebrating a set-piece propaganda moment presented as the culmination of a yearslong effort, the agency carried photos showing crowds gathered in a snow-covered resort town, with balloons and fireworks in the sky. Since he took over North Korea following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, Mr. Kim has promised to rebuild his country’s moribund economy, allowing more market activities and launching a building boom in Pyongyang, the capital, and elsewhere. Tourism is excluded from the sanctions that the United Nations has imposed on the North, which prevent it from earning hard currency by exporting its coal, iron ore, fisheries and textiles. \u200bTransforming Samjiyon\u200b from a decrepit holiday town into a modern resort complex complete with ski slopes, spas and hotels has been one of \u200bMr. Kim’s pet projects. The town is on the slopes of Paektusan (also spelled Baekdusan), a mountain on the border with China that many Koreans regard as the birthplace of their country and North Korean propaganda declares the birthplace of Mr. Kim’s father, a claim historians refute. In his annual \u200bNew Year’s Day address this year, \u200bMr. Kim called on his country to turn Samjiyon into “an ideal socialist village\u200b.” He has visited the construction site several times in recent years. But the project has been plagued by a lack of electricity, construction materials and other resources aggravated by the United Nations sanctions. Mr. Kim mobilized troops and what were called “loyalty donations” from his people to press ahead with the project. \u200bDefectors from the region have reported that electricity and workers were diverted to Samjiyon from surrounding towns as the authorities struggled to meet Mr. Kim’s construction deadline. Tourism is likely to become even more important to the North’s economy in the coming months. Under the United Nations’ sanctions resolutions, countries like China and Russia must send home all North Korean workers, another key source of cash for Mr. Kim’s regime, by the end of this month. Visitors have been one way for Beijing, which does not want its Communist \u200bneighbor to collapse, \u200bto extend a lifeline. Last year, 1.2 million Chinese tourists visited North Korea, a 50 percent increase from 2017, providing badly needed cash for Pyongyang, according to the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul, citing Chinese customs data. Recent visitors to Pyongyang said the number of Chinese tourists \u200bthere \u200bwas on the rise, especially after President Xi Jinping’s visit to Pyongyang in June. It was easy to spot Chinese tourist groups in Pyongyang and \u200b\u200bit has \u200boften become difficult to book flights and buy train tickets between North Korea and China\u200b, they said\u200b. Mr. Kim made the economy a top priority of official policy in April 2018, two months before he met with President Trump in Singapore, retiring his father’s songun, or military-first, strategy, which focused national resources on building up the armed forces, including North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. \u200b As his diplomatic efforts with Mr. Trump have faltered, Mr. Kim has increasingly emphasized a “self-reliant” economy, trying to boost domestic industries and mobilizing troops for building projects. He has been particularly \u200bfocused on building resort towns, a taste some analysts suspect he had acquired when he studied in Switzerland in his teens. \u200bIn Wonsan, an east coast town, he is building a large summer tourist complex that includes beachfront hotels, water parks and golf courses. In October alone, he visited Samjiyon, a resort town in Diamond Mountain and a hot-spring resort in Yangdok to encourage the resort-planners there. In Diamond Mountain, \u200bhe ordered the demolition of \u200bSouth Korean hotels and other buildings \u200bthere that the two \u200bKoreas once operated together.  Mr. Kim began pressing South Korea to reopen the complex last year, when he first met with the South’s president, Moon Jae-in. But \u200bwhen \u200bthe South \u200bbalked, Mr. Kim said North Korea would rebuild the town on its own. North Korea has recently invited tourists from China and other countries to the mountain for hiking trips, according to news reports. Because he assumes there will be no immediate lifting or easing \u200bof \u200bsanctions, Mr. Kim has sought to weather them by promoting tourism, analysts said. At the same time, North Korea gave the United States by the end of this month to return to the negotiating table with a more flexible proposal\u200b on how to end its nuclear weapons program\u200b. The North has threatened to abandon diplomacy and perhaps resume missile and nuclear tests if that deadline is not met. “What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get,” Ri Thae-song, a vice foreign minister of North Korea who handled United States affairs, said on Tuesday.']",Tourism is one of the few remaining sources of hard currency for Kim Jong-un’s government. He has embarked on a push for more foreign visitors.
Suspects in Mormon Family’s Killing Are Arrested in Mexico,2019-12-01,By Kirk Semple,"['MEXICO CITY — The Mexican authorities on Sunday detained several suspects implicated in the massacre of nine members of a Mormon sect in northern Mexico in early November, according to the office of the nation’s attorney general. The detentions came during a joint operation by members of the Mexican armed forces and intelligence agents and followed the detention last month of another suspect living in Mexico City, the attorney general’s office said in a statement, providing no further information about the suspects’ identities, their connection to the murders or the circumstances of their arrests. In his first year in office, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has struggled to articulate a coherent crime-fighting strategy, and to curb spiraling violence and the immense power of organized crime groups. The failure was highlighted by this harrowing incident, which rose above the usual drumbeat of news about bloodshed in Mexico, in part because the victims were women and children and dual American and Mexican citizens. Mr. López Obrador took office last year vowing to remove the military from the streets in the fight against drug trafficking organizations and end his predecessors’ war on drugs. Instead, he promised, he would address the roots of crime by tackling poverty through social development programs and investment — a strategy he refers to as “hugs, not bullets.” On Sunday, speaking at Mexico City’s central square during a celebration of his first anniversary in office, Mr. Lopez Obrador defended his approach. “The federal executive has undertaken a paradigm shift in security,” he declared. Highlighting the challenges he faces, at least 21 people were killed during clashes over the weekend between the Mexican police and gunmen in a town in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila. The dead included four police officers, officials said. On Sunday, demonstrators marched through central Mexico City demanding better security and justice for Mexicans. Members of the Mormon family torn apart by the massacre last month participated in the event, local media reported. “We have to work together to find a way to stop the violence,” said Julián LeBarón, a relative of the victims, according to The Associated Press. “If we’re not capable of defending life in our country, we will never be a civilized country much less a free country.” The López Obrador administration is desperate to show gains in its investigation into the killing of the Mormons — three women and six of their children who were members of a fundamentalist Mormon community that took root decades ago in northern Mexico. The group, traveling in three cars, were ambushed on Nov. 4 as they drove through the state of Sonora. In the days after the attack, the authorities floated the idea that the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity and said they were exploring the possibility that it was related to a conflict between two criminal groups fighting for control of that region of the country. After the massacre, President Trump declared on Twitter that it was time “for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.” Last week, Mr. Trump said he planned to designate Mexican drug trafficking groups as terrorist organizations, suggesting that he was motivated in part by the number of American deaths attributable to their activities. Some members of the Mormon communities of northern Mexico have also pressed for the designation. Mexican officials — and, broadly, the Mexican people — have bristled at the announcement, with many worrying that it would somehow open the door to American military incursions into Mexico. Mr. López Obrador addressed this concern at his anniversary celebration on Sunday, saying: “We won’t accept any kind of intervention. We’re a free and sovereign country.”']",The announcement did not include details on the suspects’ identities or their connection to the murders. The López Obrador administration is under pressure to curb spiraling violence.
"In Tense Exchange, Trump and Macron Put Forth Dueling Visions for NATO",2019-12-03,By Katie Rogers and Annie Karni,"['LONDON — President Trump sat down in a gilded chair beside President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday, prepared for what has become a ritual of sorts on his home turf at the White House: He holds forth as another leader is left to smile stoically through his jokes, jabs and insults. But Mr. Macron changed the script. By the time their 45-minute appearance at the American ambassador’s residence in London was over, the French leader had managed a rare role reversal, putting Mr. Trump on the defensive about his vision for NATO and his handling of a military conflict involving Turkey, and swatting away the president’s joke about sending Islamic State fighters from Syria to France. “Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?” Mr. Trump said, crouching forward and claiming that “many” fighters had come from France. “I can give them to you.”  “Let’s be serious,” Mr. Macron, who sat coiled on the edge of his seat with one hand clamped firmly on his knee, replied. “The very large numbers of fighters on the ground are the fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq.” The dramatic moment, which came as both leaders were in London to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the NATO alliance, underscored how a relationship formerly known for  lingering hugs, lint-brushing and white-knuckle handshakes has devolved over divisions on matters ranging from terrorism to trade policy.  This time, the deterioration took place on live television. “The president doesn’t like confrontation in person and doesn’t quite know how to react to being on the receiving end,” said Heather A. Conley,  director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Macron understands that. He’s decided the best defense is offense.” Throughout the day, Mr. Trump made news on a number of fronts in his scattershot way,  speaking to reporters for over two hours in total. He castigated Democrats as “unpatriotic” for supporting a possible impeachment, commented on Prince Andrew’s relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey A. Epstein — “tough story,” Mr. Trump said of the prince, whom he claimed not to know — and mused that he might punt on a trade deal with China until after the 2020 election. But it was Mr. Macron who was his focus for much of the day. In November, Mr. Macron — another leader who enjoys talking — made headlines for lamenting, in an interview with The Economist magazine, what he said was the loss of American leadership, leading to “the brain death of NATO.” He said the United States under Mr. Trump appeared to be “turning its back on us,” notably by pulling troops out of northeastern Syria without notice, and called on Europeans to do more in their own defense with the aim of “strategic autonomy.’’ “You have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies,” Mr. Macron said. “None.”  His remarks at the time drew a host of rebukes from other NATO allies, including from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who called Mr. Macron’s “sweeping judgments” unnecessary.  Experts said the French leader had made a valid point, but warned that his words would be weaponized by Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday jumped at the opportunity.  In a 52-minute meeting Tuesday morning with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General, Mr. Trump called Mr. Macron’s comments last month “very insulting” and a “very, very nasty statement essentially to 28 countries.”  But when asked during the afternoon meeting to address his earlier comments about Mr. Macron, Mr. Trump, a leader averse to face-to-face confrontation, initially demurred. When it was his turn to speak, Mr. Macron was direct.  “My statement created some reactions,” Mr. Macron said. “I do stand by it.”  As they continued a terse back-and-forth, Mr. Macron targeted Mr. Trump’s relationship with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Mr. Erdogan has already upset NATO allies by purchasing a sophisticated Russian antiaircraft missile system, the S-400. He is now threatening to oppose NATO’s plans to fortify the defense of Poland and the Baltic countries if the alliance does not join him in labeling some Kurdish groups as terrorists.  Mr. Trump has maintained a soft touch with Mr. Erdogan, including giving the green light for the Turkish leader to advance troops into Northern Syria in an offensive against Kurdish-led forces that had been allied with the United States. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump would not say whether he would impose sanctions on Turkey for buying the missile system. Mr. Macron was harsher, saying that the purchase would need to be explained and that there would need to be common ground on classifying different groups of fighters as terrorists. “When I look at Turkey, they are fighting against those who fight with us,” he said. “Who is the enemy today?” During several appearances before reporters, Mr. Trump found several chances to effectively highlight a foreign policy achievement he hopes will help his re-election campaign: getting allies to pay more toward the costs of running NATO. “What I’m liking about NATO is that a lot of countries have stepped up, really, I think, at my behest,” Mr. Trump said.  But Mr. Macron made it clear that while he wanted more military spending by European countries, NATO had other challenges to address besides “just numbers.” “I’m sorry to say that we don’t have the same definition of terrorism around the table,” Mr. Macron said. Throughout the icy exchange, clear disagreements between the two leaders over how to deal with Mr. Erdogan’s approach in Syria even overshadowed the issue of France imposing taxes on American tech giants, and a potential retaliatory tariff on French wines. “We tax wine and we have other taxes scheduled,” Mr. Trump said. “But we’d rather not do that. But that’s the way it works.” Mr. Trump slumped back in his chair, while Mr. Macron sat on the edge of his chair, bobbing and gesturing energetically. Mr. Macron’s aggressive approach appeared at times to unsettle Mr. Trump, who said at one point that he did not support Iranian protesters who are calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders. That appeared to contradict his own administration’s position and the recent comments of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but Mr. Trump quickly clarified his position with a Tweet saying that the “United States of America supports the brave people of Iran.”  In the past, Mr. Trump has been so disruptive at NATO meetings that he triggered an emergency session. He has accused other member countries of shortchanging the United States on military spending, and he has called the alliance “obsolete,” questioning whether it still served a purpose. A goal of the current meeting was to avoid any formal disruptions. But Ian Lesser, a former American official who directs the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, said that the subtext of Mr. Macron’s criticism of NATO was growing doubt about Washington’s commitment. “When he says ‘brain death,’ Macron’s talking about American leadership,’’ Mr. Lesser said. “That’s perhaps what Trump is hearing. Trump’s view is that he’s turned NATO around, and the rhetoric from Paris is compromising that narrative.’’ Experts in the region said that with Britain moving toward leaving the European Union and the German government enmeshed in its own political troubles, Mr. Macron saw an opportunity to assert French leadership in Europe. “President Macron is seizing that moment, seeking to be disruptive in his own way, and so we will see how that works,” Ms. Conley said. “He’s increasingly isolating himself within Europe.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron appeared to have reached at least some détente by Tuesday evening: they emerged from the presidential limo together for a reception of world leaders at 10 Downing Street. In the background of this global drama is Mr. Trump’s possible impeachment. On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee is set to question legal experts about whether there are grounds to impeach Mr. Trump for pressuring Ukraine to take actions that could help him in the 2020 election. Several times through the day, Mr. Trump turned his attention back to impeachment, castigating the effort led by Democrats as “unpatriotic. ”And he again defended his behavior during a July call with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky — an interaction that formed the basis for the inquiry. “I did nothing wrong,” Mr. Trump said of the impeachment inquiry during a bilateral meeting with Mr. Stoltenberg, adding that he did not feel that a censure from Congress was justified, either. “You don’t censure somebody when they did nothing wrong.” On Tuesday, Mr. Trump also met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and hosted a private fund-raising round table with supporters, which Trump campaign officials said raised $3 million. Notably absent from the president’s schedule was a one-on-one meeting with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who is campaigning ahead of a Dec. 12 election and has been desperate to keep Mr. Trump at arm’s length.  Mr. Johnson is managing the political fallout from a terrorist attack on Friday in central London, where a lone extremist fatally stabbed two people and wounded three others. A chief concern in Britain is that Mr. Trump could change the course of next week’s election, intentionally or not, by sending inflammatory tweets or wading into local politics in interviews. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump indicated that he would respect Mr. Johnson’s wishes and not interfere in the impending election.  “I’ll stay out of the election,” Mr. Trump said. “I think Boris is very capable and he will do a good job.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting.']",President Trump said a warning from President Emmanuel Macron of France that Europe could no longer assume American support was “a very dangerous statement.” Mr. Macron said he stood by it. 
"For Trump and Europe, a Surprising Role Reversal",2019-12-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — President Trump has always relished throwing European leaders off balance, antagonizing allies, embracing insurgents and setting off a frantic contest for how best to deal with him. Now, as Europe undergoes dizzying political changes of its own, it is throwing Mr. Trump off balance. In London for a NATO summit meeting, Mr. Trump was subjected to a rare tongue-lashing on trade and terrorism by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who dismissed his attempt to lighten the mood with a curt, “Let’s be serious.” Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump held his own tongue about British politics, heeding Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plea not to barge into Britain’s election at the 11th hour. For a president who prides himself on being the Great Disrupter, it was a startling turnabout, one that underscored how Europe’s shifting landscape — with an ambitious president in France, a lame-duck leader in Germany and a breakaway populist in Britain — has scrambled the calculus for Mr. Trump. For now, at least, Mr. Macron has replaced Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as Mr. Trump’s chief antagonist on the Continent. The French president’s recent assertion that NATO was exhausted and strategically adrift — or in a state of “brain death” as he put it in an interview with The Economist last month — angered both Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel and has created an improbable, if perhaps fleeting, alignment between those two leaders who spent much of the last three years on opposite poles. As for Mr. Johnson, his most natural ally, Mr. Trump bridled almost visibly as he tried to stay out of the British election on Dec. 12. “I don’t want to complicate it,” he said, in a grudging admission that he is so unpopular in Britain that a full-throated endorsement of the prime minister could backfire. When NATO decided to mark its 70th anniversary with a meeting in London, the goal was to limit the potential for disruption from Mr. Trump if it were held in Washington. As luck would have it, the summit wound up falling in the final 10 days of an election campaign in which Mr. Trump has been a recurring issue.  “Trump is in an awkward position right now,” said Lewis A. Lukens, who served as acting ambassador to Britain in the first months of the Trump presidency. “His instincts are to pull Johnson close, but he will have been told by his team that any intervention would be counterproductive.” Since Mr. Trump took office, Europeans have labored to adjust to his prejudices and preferences. They praised him for his success in calling on NATO members to increase their payments to the alliance, flattered him with invitations to military parades, as Mr. Macron once did, and stoically bore his attacks on their trade surpluses with the United States, like Ms. Merkel has. But Europe is changing, too, with Britain seeking to leave, Ms. Merkel nearing the end of her tenure, and Mr. Macron staking his claim to European leadership with a vision of the future that depends less on the United States. His criticism of NATO is inevitably, if indirectly, a criticism of Mr. Trump and his “America First” policy. As Europe changes, Mr. Trump is finding that he has to recalibrate his approach. With his own re-election campaign looming, he also wants credit for what he views as his foreign policy accomplishments, including NATO. On the first day of his London trip, it made for some remarkable political theater. The president who once threatened to pull the United States out of NATO suddenly emerged as the alliance’s defender. The president who once exchanged a death-grip handshake with Mr. Macron sat by wordlessly while his much-younger counterpart lectured him on the need to fight the Islamic State. The president who championed Brexit and hectored Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, about her deal-making skills suddenly had nothing to say about it. Asked about the British election, Mr. Trump resorted to talking about how his campaigning had helped Republican gubernatorial candidates in Kentucky and Louisiana — never mind that both men lost — before implicitly acknowledging that his involvement in Britain would probably not help. “I love this country,” Mr. Trump said. “I love a lot of countries, but I’m representing the U.S. They may not like me because I’m representing us, and I represent us strong.” The president has always viewed statecraft as both highly personal and strictly transactional, which makes some experts wary of drawing overly broad conclusions from Mr. Trump’s early performance in London. His clash with Mr. Macron, they said, may reflect as much personal pique about Mr. Macron’s assertive style as basic disagreements over the future of NATO. “At the moment, Macron has replaced Merkel as his nemesis,” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, “but I could see them working together in a few months.” “There is a general alignment of their critiques on NATO,” Mr. Wright continued. “Macron says NATO should focus on terrorism; Trump says NATO should focus on terrorism and the Middle East. Macron says Russia is not such a big threat; Trump says Russia is not such a big threat.” If anything, he said, other NATO members have worried that the two leaders would ally too closely behind a vision for the alliance that dials back the clock — away from strategic rivals like China and toward the quagmires of the Middle East. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet Ms. Merkel on Wednesday, and history suggests it will be a far less tempestuous encounter than he had with Mr. Macron. Still, there is little evidence that he will develop any closer ties with the chancellor in her waning years than he did with Mrs. May. Likewise, Mr. Trump’s newfound discretion on British politics will probably last only until Dec. 12, when Britons go to the polls, if that long. If Mr. Johnson is successful in winning a parliamentary majority and takes Britain out of the European Union, he will be more dependent than ever on his relationship with Mr. Trump, particularly since he has sold Brexit on the promise that he can cut a lucrative trade deal with the United States. Mr. Johnson’s Labour Party opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, is trying to stoke fears that Mr. Trump will demand that a Conservative-led government open up Britain’s revered National Health Service to American drug companies. On his last trip to London, Mr. Trump declared that “everything will be on the table” in a negotiation, including the National Health Service, before walking back his comments the following day. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he did not even know how those rumors got started. “We have absolutely nothing to do with it, and we wouldn’t want to,” he said. “If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we’d want nothing to do with it.” Even the ceremonial parts of Mr. Trump’s schedule attested to a changing of the guard. Before attending a reception given by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening, the president and the first lady, Melania Trump, visited Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, at their residence, Clarence House. Prince Charles has assumed a more central role in the royal family’s affairs in the aftermath of the scandal involving Prince Andrew’s ties with the disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew, who had withdrawn from public life, was conspicuously absent from the festivities on Tuesday. “I don’t know Prince Andrew, but it’s a tough story,” said Mr. Trump, who was photographed with the prince during his state visit to London earlier this year and at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate, nearly two decades ago.']","Where the president once kept European leaders off balance, Europe’s shifting landscape now has the Great Disrupter scrambling to recalibrate his approach."
"Fighting Extradition, Huawei Executive Writes of ‘Moments of Fear’",2019-12-02,By Dan Bilefsky,"['On the first anniversary of her arrest, the Huawei technology executive Meng Wanzhou has written a reflective, sometimes plaintive letter describing her year in detention in Vancouver as having “moments of fear, pain, disappointment, helplessness, torment, and struggle” but also acceptance and more time for herself.  Ms. Meng, 47, a former secretary at Huawei who rose to become its chief financial officer and public face of the company, was arrested in Vancouver last December after the United States had requested her extradition on fraud charges.  She has been freed on bail but is not permitted to leave Vancouver. She is accused, among other things, of deceiving four banks to enable Huawei to evade American sanctions against Iran.   “Over the past year, I have also learned to face up to and accept my situation,” she wrote in the letter, which was published on Huawei’s website on Sunday. “I’m no longer afraid of the unknown.” Her arrest, she wrote, had radically changed her daily life, allowing more time for hobbies like reading and painting.  “When I was in Shenzhen, time used to pass by very quickly,” she wrote, referring to Huawei’s headquarters city in southern China. “Every day, my schedule was fully packed and I was constantly rushing from place to place, and from meeting to meeting.”  She continued: “Right now, time seems to pass slowly. It is so slow that I have enough time to read a book from cover to cover. I can take the time to discuss minutiae with my colleagues or to carefully complete an oil painting.” The arrest in December of last year thrust Canada into the center of a diplomatic struggle between China and the United States. China has detained — in retaliation, some say — two Canadians and accused them of espionage. It has also sentenced two other Canadians to death on drug-related accusations.  China cut off trade of Canadian canola oil and, for a time, halted beef and pork imports although those restrictions were lifted in November. The extradition hearing is scheduled to begin in January after months of hearings in which the prosecution and defense have wrangled over the circumstances of her arrest and the validity of the charges. Ms. Meng has cut a glamorous figure in court, variously wearing casual outfits or colorful designer dresses. On the day of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in September, she wore a bright red dress, adorned with an enamel Chinese flag pin. Her penchant for designer stiletto heels, sometimes with glitter on them, draws attention to the GPS-tracker on her left ankle that she has been ordered by the judge to wear to make sure she does not flee the country. Yet the contrast between her gilded detention in Vancouver compared with the fate of the imprisoned Canadians in China has raised hackles in Canada. While the Canadians are held in isolation in undisclosed locations, denied access to lawyers, and prevented from going outside or seeing sunlight, Ms. Meng has been out on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars — about $7.5 million — and living in a gated, seven-bedroom mansion in the city’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. The mansion, which Ms. Meng owns, has been estimated to be worth as much as 16 million Canadian dollars.  Ms. Meng is also able to travel relatively freely around the city. In the letter, Ms. Meng thanked supporters and Huawei’s customers for standing by her.  “In Chinese, the character for ‘light’ is composed of two parts: one that means fire, representing hope, and one that means people,” she wrote. “My dear friends, your warmth is a beacon that lights my way forward, and I appreciate it more than words can say.” She also paid tribute to Canadians and saluted the kindness of the security officers, both at the correctional facility where she was initially held and during her confinement under her bail terms. Ms. Meng’s lawyers have argued that her actions do not constitute a crime in Canada, a prerequisite for the case to succeed. Her defense also says Ms. Meng is the victim of an elaborate conspiracy by Canadian border agents and the F.B.I. to arrest her in what they have characterized as a politically motivated case pressed by President Trump to get a better trade deal with China. The defense has also filed a civil case against the Canadian authorities, arguing that her rights were breached when she was initially detained in Vancouver. Canada has a record of granting about 90 percent of extradition requests, and legal experts say Ms. Meng is likely to be extradited, though it could take months — or even years — for the courts to reach a final decision.

"Ukraine Knew of Aid Freeze in July, Says Ex-Top Official in Kyiv",2019-12-03,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['KYIV, Ukraine — As deputy foreign minister, it was Olena Zerkal’s job to read incoming diplomatic cables from embassies around the world. One from Washington caught her eye back in July, she recalled: It said the Trump administration had frozen military aid for Ukraine. “We had this information,” Ms. Zerkal said in an interview. “It was definitely mentioned there were some issues.” The timing of when Ukraine knew of the hold on the military aid is a critical question in the impeachment hearings in Congress. Democrats are trying to build a case that President Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky by withholding the aid and a White House meeting — at the same time he was pressing for a public announcement that Ukraine would investigate his political rivals. Mr. Trump and his allies have also made the timing issue part of his defense. How could Ukrainian officials feel the pressure of the aid freeze, they ask, if they did not know about it when the White House was pushing them to investigate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of Mr. Trump’s biggest challengers in the 2020 American presidential election?  “They didn’t even know the money wasn’t paid,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last month. Ms. Zerkal’s account is the first public acknowledgment by a Ukrainian official that senior figures in Kyiv knew about the aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and that the Zelensky administration sought to keep that fact from surfacing to avoid getting drawn into the American impeachment debate.  She said her own government blocked a trip she had planned to Washington to meet members of Congress in October, worried she would discuss matters related to impeachment and drag its president into an inquiry he has been eager to avoid. “They worried about this,” she said of Mr. Zelensky’s advisers. “They said, ‘This is not the time for you to travel to D.C.’” The cancellation of her trip was confirmed by Congressional aides. Mr. Zelensky, whose government is still dependent on the Trump administration for aid and diplomatic backing, has said he did not learn of the aid freeze until before a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence on Sept. 1, though he has been vague about exactly when.  But according to testimony in the impeachment inquiry, Ukrainian diplomats in Washington knew there was a problem with the aid as early as July 25, the day Mr. Trump spoke with the Ukrainian president by phone and asked him to investigate his rivals.  In the interview, Ms. Zerkal, who said she resigned from her post last week to protest her government’s back channel diplomacy with both the Trump administration last summer and Russia this fall, provided an insider’s account of when senior officials in Kyiv learned of the freeze, and how they tried to keep the information from becoming public. Her account is backed by Laura K. Cooper, the American deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, who said in Congressional testimony during the impeachment inquiry that Ukrainian diplomats knew about the aid freeze at least by July 25, when they began to question United States officials about it.  That was the same day Mr. Trump spoke by phone with Mr. Zelensky and asked the Ukrainian leader to do him the “favor” of investigating the activities of Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked into Democratic servers during the 2016 presidential election.  Ms. Zerkal says she became aware of the hold by July 30, a few days after Mr. Trump’s phone call with Mr. Zelensky. She said she read a diplomatic cable from Ukrainian officials in Washington about the hold and asked for a meeting with a senior aide to Mr. Zelensky to discuss it on July 30. The cable had been sent the previous week, she said, but she could not confirm the precise date it had been transmitted. The Ukrainian presidential administration was copied as a recipient of the cable from the embassy in Washington, she said, adding: “We received it simultaneously.”  Whether senior Ukrainian officials knew of the aid freeze before the July 25 phone call or not, the accounts of Ms. Zerkal and Ms. Cooper show that the Ukrainian government was aware of the hold on aid through several critical weeks in August as United States diplomats pressed Mr. Zelensky to make a public statement on the investigations. Later, as the impeachment inquiry ramped up in the United States, Mr. Zelensky’s administration tried to squelch information that could embarrass or undercut Mr. Trump, Ms. Zerkal said.  At a meeting in September, Ms. Zerkal said, a senior aide to Mr. Zelensky told her to “keep silent” and avoid news media inquires on any topic.  The foreign minister appointed by Mr. Zelensky, Vadym Prystaiko, later blocked a planned visit to Washington by Ms. Zerkal in October, she said. His concern, she said, was that she would discuss information relevant to the impeachment proceedings — like when Ukraine learned military aid had been put on hold — with members of Congress. Ms. Zerkal says she had arranged meetings with politicians from both parties, including Democratic Senators Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Chuck Schumer of New York, and Republican Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as with staff members of Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The stated purpose of the meetings was to discuss American sanctions on Russia, but questions of when Ukraine became aware of the freeze on American aid could have come up.  “His main message to me was to keep silent, to not comment without permission,” Ms. Zerkal said of the aide to Mr. Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, who asked that she keep a low profile on all matters, not just those related to the United States. “They are in a very tricky situation and they understand this.” Mr. Zelensky’s press office did not respond to questions about Ms. Zerkal’s account of how the government learned of the aid freeze or the reasons for canceling her trip to meet with members of Congress.  But Mr. Zelensky has insisted he wants to steer clear of the impeachment process and has signaled a desire for good relations with the Trump administration. Speaking in New York in September, he said he had not been pressured by Mr. Trump. Later, at a news conference in October, Mr. Zelensky said he was not aware, at the time of his phone call with Mr. Trump on July 25, that military aid was frozen. On Saturday, he told journalists from Time magazine and three European publications, “look, I never talked to the president from the position of quid pro quo.”  But he also had pointed comments on the hold on aid. “We’re at war,” he said. “If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us. I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about quid pro quo.” Ms. Zerkal’s account demonstrates just how hard, bordering on impossible, it is for Mr. Zelensky to avoid taking sides in the impeachment inquiry. If he is misleading people about his knowledge of the aid freeze, then he is damaging the Democrats’ case against Mr. Trump. If he admits knowing, he damages Mr. Trump’s case. The Zelensky administration, Ms. Zerkal said, is most concerned about placating Mr. Trump, having decided that the impeachment inquiry will fail in the Senate and that Mr. Trump could be re-elected. Indications had already been stacking up that Ukrainian officials knew well before the hold became public in August, first in a blog posted by the Atlantic Council on Aug. 14 and then in an article published by Politico on Aug. 28. An associate of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, Lev Parnas, has said he warned of a possible aid freeze as early as May, though others who attended the same meeting have contested his account.  Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine specialist in the National Security Council, testified that he learned of a hold in early July. More United States officials became aware during a conference call on July 18, and the Office of Management and Budget put the hold in writing on July 25, shortly after Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Zelensky. Ms. Zerkal said she was alarmed to read of the freeze in late July. Ukraine is at war with Russian-backed separatists in two eastern provinces and considers the United States an ally.  “This information caught my attention,” she said. “Without your clear support and stance against Russian aggression we won’t be able, alone, to protect ourselves.” Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting from Washington.']","Ukraine’s government learned of the military aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and tried to keep that knowledge from going public, an ex-deputy foreign minister said.

China Cracks Down on Fentanyl. But Is It Enough to End the U.S. Epidemic?,2019-12-01,By Steven Lee Myers,"['When things go wrong, those in power often promise to make it right. But do they? In this series, The Times investigates to see if those promises were kept. XINGTAI, China — An online pharmacy advertising itself as a seller of “high purity, real pure” fentanyl still responds right away to potential customers. “Which products do you want to buy,” a salesperson replied within a minute to an inquiry in English on WhatsApp, the encrypted messaging service. But when contacted from an American telephone number and asked about the availability of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid fueling an epidemic killing tens of thousands of Americans a year, the seller demurred.  “I don’t sell any more.” Until recently, much of the illicit fentanyl that found its way to the United States came like this: easily ordered online from a source in China and seamlessly shipped by international delivery companies, including the United States Postal Service.  Fentanyl sourced from China accounted for 97 percent of the drug seized from international mail services by United States law enforcement in both the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Now, China’s Communist government is taking steps to stop the flood, as the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, promised President Trump he would do. After the two leaders met in Buenos Aires at the Group of 20 summit at the end of last year, the White House released a statement saying that “President Xi, in a wonderful humanitarian gesture, has agreed to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance.” What We Found Some six months later, China did exactly that. As a result, the large, freewheeling and mostly unregulated fentanyl industry that had operated in a gray area of Chinese law appears to have stopped selling the drug for export — or at least as openly as hundreds of suppliers once did. Some of the distributors, who still can be easily found in online searches, claimed to be complying with the new rules banning the overseas sale of synthetic opioids.  Others appeared to have shut down their operations, disconnecting numbers which had previously reached salespeople offering to mail the drugs to the United States — no questions asked.  China’s new focus on shutting down the trade has meant shipments of fentanyl to the United States have declined significantly in the last year, according to Chinese officials, citing figures from the United States Customs and Border Protection agency. The American agency did not dispute that drop. “China’s control over fentanyl substances is becoming stricter and stricter,” said Yu Haibin, the deputy director of the country’s National Narcotics Control Commission. Following a tightening of drug controls that took effect May 1, the government put 91 manufacturers and 234 individual distributors under “strict supervision,” warning them not to export fentanyl or related drugs, like carfentanil, according to a government report released in September. It claimed to have increased inspections and arrests in 13 cities and regions where pharmaceutical companies have proliferated. One of them is Xingtai, an industrial city about 250 miles south of Beijing, where a court earlier this month convicted nine people of smuggling fentanyl into the United States. The convictions capped an investigation that began in 2017 with a tip from American drug-enforcement agents. The accused ringleader received a suspended death sentence; two others were sentenced to life in prison. The case was one of three investigations in which the Chinese authorities have been cooperating with American law enforcement, Chinese officials said. The investigations have come after a torrent of criticism that Chinese officials were lax toward — or even complicit in — a major supply chain fueling the fentanyl crisis in America.  China’s harshest critics have even accused the country of deliberately flooding the market as revenge for the Opium Wars of the 19th century, though there is no evidence of that. As recently as August, Mr. Trump had chastised the Chinese leader on Twitter for not keeping his promises to get tough on fentanyl. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy called the recent convictions “a positive step.” Experts and officials in the United States warned, however, that it was far too soon to declare a victory in China’s fight against fentanyl.  The market for the drug — which the Chinese like to point out has always been largely American — appears insatiable. For a sense of how the crisis has exploded: In the 2019 fiscal year that ended in October, American customs agents seized 1,154 kilograms of fentanyl, or 2,545 pounds, compared with 31 kilograms, or 70 pounds, in 2015. Fentanyl is cheap, easily synthesized in a lab and more addictive than heroin. That means the financial rewards will remain high enough to entice those willing to break the law, especially in a large and poorly regulated chemical industry like China’s. So manufacturers and distributors that had operated in the open may simply shift their operations underground. “The scale of China’s under-regulated industries allows for minimally trained technicians with access to the proper inputs to follow simple synthesis steps while avoiding oversight,” the authors of a new report on fentanyl by the RAND Corporation wrote. “China’s pharmaceutical and industrial chemical industries are large and beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement.” What We Found Even so, the steps China has taken to reduce the flow of fentanyl are real, according to experts and officials on both sides of the Pacific. China has some of the strictest drug laws in the world, allowing capital punishment against major producers and traffickers. Until recently, however, loopholes in legislation and enforcement allowed the production of synthetic opioids like fentanyl to skirt the attention of the authorities. In China, as in the United States, fentanyl can be legally prescribed and is used as an anesthetic in surgery and for severe pain relief. Because of its potency, its production is strictly controlled by law. Until this year, however, China’s laws did not cover new, chemical variants of fentanyl that were constantly being produced to sidestep existing legal restrictions. Manufacturers could simply adjust the chemical structure slightly and create a new analogue of the drug, not yet banned. In this gray area of the law, production in China soared. “It’s just like water: They’re finding the gaps and the cracks,” Bryce Pardo, an associate policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and a lead author on the organization’s report, said in an interview. In April, the Chinese government moved to plug those legal holes. It announced it would place all variants of fentanyl — as a class — on the list of controlled substances, rather than individually adding each new version of the drug to the banned list after it had hit the streets. With the export controls that are applied to drugs on the list, the fentanyl variants that had fallen into the legal gray area before were now explicitly banned from being sold abroad. Tang Jianbin, a lawyer in Beijing who specializes in criminal drug cases, said the move was a significant concession to American demands. The country even had to pass a new law allowing it to designate the entire class of synthetic opioids as controlled substances. “This legal adjustment is an innovation in our country,” Mr. Tang said.   China made this move in the middle of its protracted trade war with the United States, and it may have been done to help resolve the acrimonious — and continuing — dispute. Drugs entering China from the West have a dark historical resonance in the country, which is still bitter over the forced importation of opium by the British in the 19th century, the cause of two wars and the ceding of Hong Kong. And Chinese officials have long bristled at any criticism they were negligent on the law enforcement front and were always quick to point out that fentanyl was a uniquely American problem. Opioid use — and abuse — is far higher in the United States than anywhere else in the world, and there are plenty of other sources of the drug beyond China. Mr. Yu, the narcotics agency deputy director, cited statistics from the United States Customs and Border Protection showing that of the 536.8 kilograms of fentanyl seized between October 2018 and March 2019, only 5.87 kilograms, or just over 1 percent, was shipped from China.  “From these statistics it is clear that China is not the main source of fentanyl substances in the United States,” Mr. Yu said at a news conference in Xingtai following the verdict against the nine fentanyl dealers. What We Found American officials acknowledge a decline in shipments from China, but like Mr. Trump, keep pressing the country to do more. “While it appears that the direct shipment of fentanyl-related substances from China to the United States has declined in recent months, this is only one of many measures that the United States looks to for indicators of progress,” the customs bureau wrote in a statement responding to questions about the Chinese claims. “The most important measure of progress is the reduction of American lives lost to these drugs.” One area where American officials would like to see more action is in pursuing manufacturers and distributors that detectives and prosecutors have linked directly to overdoses in the United States, often after painstaking investigations tracing the trail of fentanyl to its origin. In 2018, the Justice Department announced an indictment of a father and son, Zheng Guanghua and Zheng Fujing, who had operated a company called Qinsheng Pharmaceutical in Shanghai. The company appears to have closed — or gone underground — but the two men are believed to be at large.   It was not clear if the American case against them was one of the other two cases where officials said Chinese and American investigators are cooperating. Mr. Yu, when asked, declined to discuss those cases. There is still plenty of fentanyl in the United States that was shipped from China before the new law took effect.  This summer, the authorities in Virginia seized 30 kilograms of fentanyl, enough “to kill over 14 million people,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The fentanyl was ordered from a vendor in Shanghai in April of last year. While China’s crackdown has put significant restraints on what had been an unbridled export environment, the murky and still under-regulated nature of the chemical industry makes it difficult to shut down illicit production entirely without a more sustained effort by the Chinese authorities, according to Mr. Pardo of the RAND Corporation. “They’re not doing everything they can,” he said, “but they’re making an effort on some level.”  The Takeaway: A promise kept, but a devastating drug problem persists.

How Charlottesville’s Echoes Forced New Zealand to Confront Its History,2019-12-03,By Jamie Tarabay,"['HAMILTON, New Zealand — An 80-year-old Maori man walked up to a statue of a colonial-era British naval commander one winter morning in 2018, a can of paint and a claw hammer in his hands.  “The red paint was to change the way he looked, and the hammer was to break his nose,” said the man, Taitimu Maipi.  Mr. Maipi’s small act of vandalism in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, was intended to be a reminder of the pain that white settlers inflicted on the Indigenous Maori people. It ended up forcing a national reckoning over historical memory and cultural identity that paralleled in many ways the upheaval a year before in Charlottesville, Va.  The attack in Hamilton drew extensive coverage in the local newspaper. Residents responded with letters denouncing the vandalism. And the conversation caught the eye of one longtime reader: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.  In September, Ms. Ardern announced that the national school curriculum would be changed to require lessons on the 19th-century New Zealand Land Wars, in which British troops killed more than 2,000 Maori. “I did not see that coming,” Mr. Maipi, a longtime activist, said recently as he stood beside the bronze statue of Capt. John Hamilton, which remains in the middle of Hamilton’s downtown square. In a different time, the seemingly minor gesture of protest — after the attack, Mr. Maipi stopped by City Hall to leave his contact information and later got off with a police warning — might have been quickly forgotten. But his defiant action came not long after the deadly white supremacist violence in Charlottesville over the planned removal of a Confederate statue.  “I think it’s all connected,” said Aaron Leaman, a reporter for The Waikato Times, which published a series of articles as part of a campaign to bring more of New Zealand’s history into its schools. “I don’t think what happened here could be seen in isolation.”  After Mr. Maipi’s vandalism, some New Zealanders called for the statue’s removal because of the role of Captain Hamilton — for whom the city is named, though he never set foot there — in the deaths of Maori during the Land Wars, which raged from 1845 to 1872.  Those bloody conflicts broke out after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 between the colonial government and the Maori. Disputes over land sales grew into major campaigns to confiscate territory and reinforce British sovereignty.  Community upheaval followed these assaults against the Maori, and more than 100 years later, they still lag on many social measures like income and life expectancy, though the government has worked to close the gap. New Zealand is still  paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement claims related to the treaty. “I just wanted to expose the fact that this statue shouldn’t be here,” Mr. Maipi said. “I wanted to break something,” he added. “I really meant what I did.” Captain Hamilton, he said, “was a murderer.”  “There’s a lot of pain there for people who were part of those wars,” he added. Other citizens — many of them older, white residents who wrote letters to the editor — complained about the damage to public property and argued that removing the statue would be akin to erasing history. Some used racist language.  “A lot of people were saying this is terrible, destroying public property, and we were saying, come on people, there’s a lot of history behind this, and there aren’t a lot of Maori statues or any kind of acknowledgment of their role,” said Jonathan MacKenzie, the editor in chief of The Waikato Times. “Clearly, the people reading had little understanding of the country’s past, and what they knew was based on the wrong information,” Mr. MacKenzie added. While some of the bigoted statements might have been ignored in the past, said Mr. Leaman, the reporter, such views now command greater attention after the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch.  “It’s easy to brush them off as fringe,” he said, “but after Christchurch, we take hate speech more seriously.” The newsroom decided to work to educate its readership, Mr. MacKenzie said. “We thought, why don’t we do some stories on people who fought on the Maori side of the war; they’d be passed down orally,” he said.  The effort would build on a push by two nearby schools to make teaching of the Land Wars compulsory. Currently, New Zealand history is an elective in school, and the Land Wars aren’t part of the curriculum at all.  “We thought we could really put some pressure on and act as a bit of an amplifier,” Mr. MacKenzie said.  The journalists didn’t imagine that the stories would get much notice. But they hadn’t anticipated the attention of a prime minister who keeps an eye on the city of her birth. The Waikato Times’s campaign “stood out to me because I know the region well and because it’s a view I’ve held for some time,” Ms. Ardern said in an email to The New York Times. She announced two months ago that changes to the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools would be made within the next three years. Ms. Ardern said the public reaction had been “incredible and far-reaching. I think a lot of that stems from a desire from New Zealanders to know more about their own country’s history, our land and our people.”  Mr. Maipi said that New Zealanders had been better at commemorating foreign wars, like World War I, than they had been at acknowledging local history, because of the cost to the Maori. “We need to educate the country that this happened; we need to educate our children,” he said. He added: “The story will be told by the children. Unless you tell the children, it will die.” The newly elected mayor of Hamilton, Paula Southgate, is waiting on a report that will assess the street names and statues throughout the city that might be culturally offensive to the Maori. She expects it to recommend moving the statue of Captain Hamilton. “If there’s something that’s blatantly culturally insensitive, you need to address it and be respectful about that,” she said.']","A Maori man attacked a statue to raise awareness of his ancestors’ pain.

"In Russia, an Updated Law With New Restrictions on Freedom of Speech",2019-12-02,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — For years, nonprofit organizations in Russia have contended with a law branding them as “foreign agents” if they took money from abroad, presenting fines and bureaucratic hurdles that sometimes pushed those groups to shut down.  Now, individuals who publish anything online and get paid from foreign sources will face the same legal obstacles.  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday signed into law several legal amendments that will require individuals to register as foreign agents if they publish “printed, audio, audiovisual, or other reports and materials” and receive money from foreign governments, foreign organizations, or even simply from foreign citizens.  Russian lawmakers passed the amendments to Russia’s legal code in recent weeks despite opposition from activists, public figures, and international critics, who argued that the new restrictions will further stifle free speech. Russians generally don’t face outright censorship online, but they increasingly fear legal consequences for posting anti-government messages. The law would represent “a disproportionate interference in the freedom of expression and media freedom,” Harlem Désir, the representative on freedom of the media for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in a statement last month. “It may have a considerable chilling effect on journalists, as well as on bloggers, experts, or other individuals publishing information, particularly online.” The lawmakers said they were responding to foreign agent laws in other countries, pointing to the case of Maria Butina, the Russian gun-rights activist deported from the United States in October after being convicted of conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government. Like many of Russia’s laws restricting freedom of expression, the new amendments appear likely to be applied selectively in order to serve as a deterrent. A lawmaker who helped draft the law, Vasily Piskarev, said he expected the amendments to apply to “a small circle of individuals.”  But in theory, any Russian who is paid by foreign news organizations, or simply posts on social media while receiving money from abroad, could be forced to register under the new law. Compliance would require stating publicly that one is a foreign agent and filing financial reports with the government.  Foreign organizations like the MacArthur Foundation have shuttered their offices in Russia in recent years in response to the foreign agent law. Some Russian organizations that get foreign funding, like the human rights group Memorial, have faced hefty fines for noncompliance — for instance, for failing to spell out their foreign agent status in an Instagram account.  The new amendments targeting individuals could apply to someone who posts on Facebook and receives income from a rental apartment in Minsk, a Memorial lawyer, Marina Agaltsova, said in a column about the law. It creates, she went on, “limitless possibilities for interpretation.” ']",President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday signed a law that could require anyone distributing information and being paid from abroad to register as a foreign agent.
"Malta Leader Says He Will Resign, as Murder Inquiry Widens",2019-12-02,By Andrew Higgins,"['VALLETTA, Malta — Destabilized by a widening investigation into the 2017 murder of Malta’s best-known journalist, the prime minister of the Mediterranean island nation announced on Sunday that he would resign, but not leave office until January, following an uproar over the possible role of close associates in the killing. The announcement by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat came just a few hours after thousands of protesters gathered in the Maltese capital, Valletta, to demand his immediate resignation. It was the largest in a series of demonstrations in recent days triggered by suspicions that senior officials knew in advance about the plot to kill the journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, and later tried to cover it up. The protesters, chanting “assassins, assassins” and “shame on you,” marched along the ancient capital city’s main shopping street to the courthouse where, on Saturday, a prominent local businessman, Yorgen Fenech, was arraigned on charges of complicity in the murder of the journalist and other crimes related to the killing. Ms. Caruana Galizia, who was loved by some and loathed by others for her reporting — a mix of real scoops and scabrous, personal attacks — was killed in October 2017 by a bomb planted in her car that, detonated by a cellphone, exploded as she was driving away from her family’s home. A previously slow-moving investigation into the murder suddenly accelerated last week and reached the upper levels of the government. Mr. Muscat’s chief of staff, Keith Schembri, an old friend of the businessman charged on Saturday, resigned on Tuesday. He was taken in for questioning by investigators looking into the murder but was later released. Mr. Muscat’s tourism minister, Konrad Mizzi, also resigned, and the economy minister, Christian Cardona, said he was suspending his duties until the murder investigation ended.  All three men had come under withering criticism and personal attack from Ms. Caruana Galizia before she was killed. Mr. Schembri and Mr. Mizzi owned offshore companies set up to receive money from a mysterious company known as 17 Black that had been registered in the name of Mr. Fenech, the businessman and prime suspect in the murder case. Prime Minister Muscat, in a televised address to the nation Sunday evening, said he was sorry for his mistakes, acknowledging, “I am not perfect.” But said he would delay his departure “to ensure stability.” Simon Busuttil, a former leader of the opposition who took part in Saturday’s protest, said Mr. Muscat’s announcement that he would leave office after his governing Labour Party selected a new leader on Jan. 12 was “not enough.” “He must go now,” he added. At the protest, Eve Borg Bonello, a teenage anti-government activist who spoke at the protest rally earlier, drew uproarious applause when she shouted: “Joseph, your time is up now.” Many waved photographs of the murdered journalist or signs paying tribute to her work exposing corruption. “Daphne, you were right!” said one.']","An investigation into the 2017 murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia has reached into the government, triggering protests and a promise by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to quit next year."
From Friends to Frenemies? Trump’s Relationships With World Leaders,2019-12-03,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — Their bromance once made headlines. But on Tuesday, it was clear that the days of President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France trading cheek kisses and clasping hands were gone. On the sidelines of a gathering for the 70th anniversary of NATO, Mr. Trump took his one-time friend to task, denouncing comments Mr. Macron made last month criticizing the American president’s leadership of NATO, and calling into question several of the French leader’s policies.  Mr. Trump is known for trying to build personal relationships with his counterparts, but he also has a penchant for public feuds, fueled in part by his off-the-cuff approach to the news media and his regular Twitter rants.  And Mr. Macron is just one of a handful of one-time buddies whose initial coziness with Mr. Trump has turned cold.  The budding friendship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron was on full display in the summer of 2017, when the American president first traveled to France.  Mr. Macron pulled out all the stops: a military parade, dinner at the Eiffel Tower and lots of hand holding. Despite their differences on a number of issues, the pair poured on the charm.  During a later visit by Mr. Macron to the White House in April 2018, they kissed each other’s cheeks in a greeting, and at one point, Mr. Trump gently brushed what he said was dandruff from Mr. Macron’s shoulder.  They lavished praise on each other, and played down their disparate approaches to trade, immigration and climate change.  But by the end of last year, the relationship had begun to sour over policy differences. The kisses gave way to terse formalities and tight-lipped smiles whenever they met.  By early last month, Mr. Macron took off the gloves. He said that the United States under Mr. Trump appeared to be “turning its back on us,” and that a lack of American leadership and strategic coordination had led to NATO experiencing “brain death.” By the time the two leaders appeared together at a news conference on Tuesday, the bromance appeared to have run its course. At one point, Mr. Trump called Mr. Macron’s diplomatic response to a question “one of the greatest nonanswers I have ever heard.” And in one particularly heated exchange, as the two discussed the containment of ISIS fighters in Syria, Mr. Trump tried to jokingly offer captive fighters to the French.  “Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?” Mr. Trump said. “Let’s be serious,” was Mr. Macron’s curt reply. When Mr. Trump met with President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil in the White House for the first time in March, he had nothing but praise for the newly elected leader.  “I think Brazil’s relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it’s ever been by far,” Mr. Trump gushed.  Mr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, had been criticized as an apologist for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for decades, and had made demeaning comments about women, minorities and homosexuals. But despite this, Mr. Trump welcomed him with warmth and promises that their personal relationship would help forge closer trade cooperation. Their similarly brash personas and populist appeal had many predicting a harmonious future, and Mr. Bolsonaro soon made his close relationship with the American president part of the foundation of his diplomacy.  His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker in Brazil’s lower house, even wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again — Trump 2020 when he visited the White House. But relations have apparently cooled. On Monday Mr. Trump pledged to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina, accusing both countries of manipulating their currencies at the expense of American farmers.  Mr. Bolsonaro on Tuesday said he would take the issue up directly with Mr. Trump. But the tariffs may make it difficult for the two to resume their once cozy relationship.  Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada — who has won international praise for his gender-balanced cabinet and progressive policies — seemed unlikely to develop a close friendship. But for Mr. Trudeau, getting along with the powerful neighbor to the south is a priority. So soon after Mr. Trump’s election, the Canadian prime minister embarked on a charm offensive, inviting Mr. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, to take part in a meeting of female business leaders, for example. At least for a while, this kind of outreach seemed to work.  During Mr. Trudeau’s first visit with Mr. Trump at the White House in 2017, the leaders exchanged niceties and talked around policy issues. Mr. Trump later spoke of their “great personal relationship” when negotiations for a new North American Free Trade Agreement began.  The issue of trade, though, would prove their downfall. Their breakup began in May 2018, when Mr. Trump announced that he was expanding tariffs on steel and aluminum to include Canada, the biggest exporter of the two metals to the United States. Canada returned the favor, swiftly announcing its own tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of American goods.  A tense phone call followed — in which Mr. Trump brought up unfounded accusations of 200-year-old acts of aggression by Canada against the United States. By the time the Group of 7 summit meeting rolled round in June 2018, they were no longer holding back.  “Canadians are polite, we’re reasonable but we also will not be pushed around,” Mr. Trudeau said.  Mr. Trump bailed on the meeting early, and sent a pair of tweets calling Mr. Trudeau “very dishonest & weak.” He said the United States would not sign the agreement that the other participants had agreed on. Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan have logged a lot of hours together. They visited a sumo arena. They had dinners with their spouses. And they played golf — both at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and during a May visit by the American president to Tokyo. “We got to know each other very, very well” on the golf course, Mr. Trump told reporters in 2017. Aligning himself to Mr. Trump has been a critical part of Mr. Abe’s strategy to secure a beneficial bilateral trade deal with the United States, an agreement Mr. Trump had vowed would “be something very exciting.” And when Mr. Trump visited Tokyo, Mr. Abe described the occasion as an opportunity to enshrine the “unshakable bond” between them.  But Mr. Trump spent much of his time during that visit focusing on domestic issues, and in some cases his own grievances rather than relations with Japan. And despite the dinners and time together, the two have been able to agree on only a limited trade deal that leaves out Japanese cars, industrial goods from the United States and farm products like rice, butter and sugar. For Mr. Abe, the question is whether his investment in courting Mr. Trump has been worth it.  ']",President Trump has a history of falling out with his friends. President Emmanuel Macron of France is the latest.
"For Boris Johnson, a Perilous Week Negotiating Terrorism and Trump",2019-12-02,By Mark Landler and Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — The last time a terrorist attack erupted on London Bridge in the final weeks of an election campaign, in 2017, the backlash stung the Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, exposing her to a damaging critique by the Labour Party that she had cut funding for the police and left the British people unprotected. This time, after a lone extremist fatally stabbed two people on Friday before being killed by the police on the bridge, the fallout seemed less likely to alter the course of the election, which is set for Dec. 12. Neither the Conservative Party nor Labour has an especially strong cudgel to wield against the other as the circumstances that put the assailant, a convicted terrorist, back on the streets are complex and involve both parties. But for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a potential change agent is still to come — in the form of President Trump, who landed in London late on Monday night to attend a meeting of NATO leaders. Mr. Trump has roiled British politics on previous visits with inflammatory statements on terrorism, as well as Brexit, trade and other sensitive issues. He is a wild card who could jolt the election with a single tweet. There is little Mr. Johnson can do to control the president. But he moved quickly to inoculate himself from blame for the terrorist attack.  Mr. Johnson pointed out that the attacker, Usman Khan, had been released early from prison under a law passed, as he put it, by the “leftie government” that preceded a decade of Conservative-led governments. The truth was far more complicated. Even Mr. Johnson’s senior aides acknowledged that his government would struggle to fulfill the prime minister’s promise, in a column he wrote for the Daily Mail on Saturday, that “these criminals must serve every day of their sentence, with no exceptions.” Mr. Johnson’s lock-’em-up sloganeering was undermined not only by the two victims of the attack, who were both devoted to prisoner rehabilitation, but also by some of those who disarmed Mr. Khan, themselves ex-convicts or prisoners on day release attending the same conference as he was. Three of the people who intervened to stop the attack had been locked up at Grendon, a prison focused on group therapy and one of the most progressive facilities in Europe. That suggested to some former prison officials and analysts that the answer is not longer sentences, but rather more useful and therapeutic ones. “It’s a tale of two prisoners, and two different regimes,” said David Wilson, an emeritus professor of criminology at Birmingham City University and chairman of the Friends of Grendon charity. “One would hope the message is that people can change — and change not through an off-the-shelf, one-size-fits-all, tick-box course — but change as a consequence of well-funded, well-staffed rigorous interventions such as those that happen at Grendon,” Mr. Wilson said. Mr. Johnson has cast himself as the perfect candidate to crack down on ex-convicts, saying he has been pushing for months to end a policy of automatically granting early release to some prisoners, like Mr. Khan. But the prime minister has struggled to make his case. For one thing, legal experts noted that no proposals of the sort had been in the Conservatives’ manifesto or in recent counterterrorism legislation. For another, former prison officials and critics said the Conservatives’ own decade-long policy of austerity, including deep cuts to prison and probation service staffing, had sown the seeds of broader threats to public safety. “We’ve neglected the criminal justice system, and now the chickens are coming home to roost,” Nick Hardwick, a former chairman of the parole board, said in a radio interview on Monday. Some legal experts also feared that Mr. Johnson would perpetuate a cycle of toughening sentencing laws, only for the government soon to be overwhelmed by a swelling prison population. The policy that provoked Mr. Johnson’s ire — some prisoners automatically being released halfway into their sentences — was intended to control a booming prison population.  Mr. Khan originally received an open-ended sentence for a terrorism-related offense. But those kinds of sentences were abolished because they left many people languishing in prison for relatively minor offenses. That did not affect the release of Mr. Khan, who had his sentence reduced separately by an appeals court. “It’s a good illustration of what happens when you try to throw the net so wide that you effectively lock up hundreds of people on the understanding that maybe there’s a handful of them who might do awful or unpleasant things if they’re not contained,” said Richard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies. Questions about sentencing policy — let alone the rehabilitation and recidivism of people, like Mr. Khan, who have been radicalized — are extremely complex. That does not play to Mr. Johnson’s advantage, given his inattention to detail and reputation for playing loose with the facts. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, faces his own challenges with this issue. He acknowledged on Sunday that he does not believe all people convicted of terrorism should “necessarily” serve their entire sentence. “I think it depends on the circumstances and it depends on the sentence but crucially depends on what they’ve done in prison,” Mr. Corbyn said to Sophy Ridge of Sky News. Conservatives seemed likely to seize on his remarks to confirm the suspicion that Labour is soft on crime. As a practical matter, though, their proposals for sentencing in terrorism cases may not be all that different.  The Conservatives have held a steady lead over Labour throughout the campaign. But in recent polls, the gap between them has shrunk to fewer than 10 percentage points, making subtle shifts in the election narrative significant.  The terrorist attack has complicated what the Conservative Party hoped would be a week devoted to security issues — an area in which the Tories historically have an advantage over the Labour Party. Mr. Johnson, experts said, could play a statesman’s role at the NATO meeting, since he is not as divisive a figure as Mr. Trump or two other leaders: President Emmanuel Macron of France, who recently referred to the alliance as being in state of “brain death,” and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who antagonized NATO members by sending troops into Syria and buying an advanced air defense system from Russia. The trouble is that Mr. Johnson’s close ties to Mr. Trump are a liability in an election. With Mr. Corbyn seeking to lash the two men together, Mr. Johnson has avoided having a one-on-one meeting with the president. “It’s a point of weakness for Boris Johnson to be seen as too close to Donald Trump,” said Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director general of RUSI, a military research center. “The last thing the government wants is for Donald Trump to urge people to vote for his two best friends, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage,” he said, referring to the leader of the Brexit Party.']","President Trump has roiled British politics before, with comments on terrorism, as well as Brexit, trade and other sensitive issues.

ISIS Is Losing Afghan Territory. That Means Little for Its Victims.,2019-12-02,By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Islamic State’s main stronghold in eastern Afghanistan collapsed in recent weeks, according to American and Afghan officials, following years of concerted military offensives from American and Afghan forces and, more recently, the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani recently claimed that the Islamic State, often known as ISIS, had been “obliterated” in Nangarhar Province, the group’s haven in the east. And in an interview in Kabul on Sunday, Gen. Austin S. Miller, the commander of all American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said the group’s loss of the terrain it stubbornly held for few years would severely restrict their recruitment and planning.  But General Miller also warned that ISIS could remain a threat in Afghanistan even if it does not hold territory, with attention required to track militants on the move and the group’s remaining urban cells. “It was instructive in Iraq and Syria — when you take away big terrain from them, they move into smaller cells and they pop up in strange places,” General Miller said. General Miller’s reluctance to affirm any type of major victory over the offshoot is indicative of the broader inroads Islamic State cells have made in Afghanistan — and of a long history of militant groups in Afghanistan bouncing back after seemingly unsustainable losses.  Western and Afghan officials see a combination of factors that led to the Islamic State’s losses in the east, forcing many of the fighters to either move or surrender. One Western official estimated that the group’s strength was now reduced to around 300 fighters in Afghanistan, from an estimated 3,000 earlier this year. The Islamic State’s presence in Afghanistan has been cited by military officials and lawmakers as one of the reasons to keep American troops in Afghanistan following any peace settlement with the Taliban. Those officials have long argued that the Taliban would not be able to defeat the group, and that the insurgents still had not done much to distance themselves from Al Qaeda, the group responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  What particularly worried officials was the Islamic State’s continued ability to plan attacks and recruit within Kabul, the Afghan capital city, despite intensified campaigns against the group there. Some of the recruits involved in the planning or execution of deadly bombings there came from the city’s top schools, officials say. But for Karimullah, a resident of Jawdara, a small village in eastern in Afghanistan where a suicide bombing attributed to the Islamic State killed more than 70 people in October, battlefield victories, political posturing or even the recent death of the Islamic State’s supreme leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, means little.  “If he’s dead or not, what does it matter?” said Karimullah, who uses just one name and lost his uncle in the blast. “We were destroyed.” His ambivalence is not uncommon here. To many Afghans, the group’s name or differences from the Taliban are barely noteworthy. But there is no doubt that extreme violence by the Islamic State has become an enduring facet of the war, deepening the already egregious suffering across the country.  The Islamic State has managed to penetrate parts of Afghan society that had been mostly untouched by the broader war for years. And the group’s resilience, even in light of its recent defeats, raises the grim prospect of an unending war even if the Taliban negotiate a peace.  Far from the central ISIS branch in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State in Afghanistan started as a collection of disenfranchised Pakistani Taliban fighters who pledged allegiance to Mr. al-Baghdadi in early 2015. It has since slowly turned into a formidable threat in Afghanistan’s mountainous east, with a reach that extends across the country, including in Kabul, the capital. Though the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria sent money to its Afghan affiliate to support its initial growth, the connection between the two groups is minimal, said Arian Sharifi, who was the director of threat assessment of the Afghan National Security Council until late last year. One of the group’s goals, officials say, is to hold territory in Afghanistan and elsewhere in south and Central Asia, trying to establish a caliphate much like the group’s earlier iteration in the Middle East.  Mr. Sharifi thinks that the Islamic State in Afghanistan will try to become the group’s global hub in the coming years, after losing territory in Iraq and Syria following concerted Western-backed offensives and airstrikes.  The Afghan government noted that more foreign fighters were slowly arriving in Afghanistan to fight for the group there as the central branch lost territory in Iraq and Syria, an assessment supported by American intelligence officials. But, Mr. Sharifi cautioned, “The Islamic State in Afghanistan is much less ideological than its Middle Eastern counterparts,” he said in a recent interview. “It is very much influenced by regional politics as well.” American officials have been divided over how much global threat the Islamic State in Afghanistan poses. While military officials emphasize the group’s ambitions, some intelligence officials believe the group remains more of a threat within the immediate region. One thing the Afghan branch shares with the central body is a hatred of Shiite Muslims, and a tendency to single them out for attacks. Still, the militants are not exclusive with their violence, as was the case in Jawdara, a mostly Sunni village.  There, Karimullah and some other residents think it was more personal: The village had stood up to the Islamic State in a dispute over the town’s water supply, and they believe the mosque bombing was meant to break their spirit.  In its early days, the Islamic State in Afghanistan distinguished itself from other terrorist organizations operating in Afghanistan, including Al Qaeda, by taking another cue from counterparts in Iraq and Syria: Its media arm distributed gruesome videos of beheadings and fighters forcing victims to sit on explosives before detonating them. But when the Islamic State detonated a suicide bomb in a wedding hall in Kabul over the summer, killing 63 people, there was little mention of ideology or local aims.  “I think ISIS is just a name in Afghanistan,” said Hajji Hussain, the owner of the wedding hall. “We don’t know who they are, and we can’t trust anyone.” He added, “They just enjoy killing people.” And that is what makes the Islamic State stand out in Afghanistan’s unending war. The Taliban often try to justify or disown attacks that killed civilians, Mr. Sharifi said.  The Islamic State, he added, does not bother. While the number of Islamic State attacks declined in recent months, according to United Nations data, American officials attributed more than 20 high-profile attacks in Kabul alone last year. For years, American and Afghan Special Operations forces, on the back of a relentless airstrike campaign, had kept the pressure to try to contain the group. The Taliban, also, increased their operations against the group in Nangarhar, according to Western and Afghan officials. Some reports  claimed that the insurgents had sent some of their elite units to the province to strike at the Islamic State.  The timing of the Taliban intensifying its offensives against ISIS was particularly interesting, as the insurgents tried to persuade the Americans in peace negotiations that they would act against international terrorist groups. But following any peace agreement, the number of hard-line insurgents defecting to the Islamic State to keep fighting has been a concern among Afghan and western officials.  But still, with the group constricting, its damage to Afghanistan, by way of cruel bombings in the capital and rampant death among innocents, has reshaped Afghans’ understanding of violence, a trauma that will linger for years to come.  Reporting was contributed by Fatima Faizi from Kabul, Zabihullah Ghazi from Jalalabad, and Asad Timory from Herat.']","Offensives against the Islamic State’s Afghan branch have brought it down to several hundred fighters, officials say.

"‘I Don’t Know Prince Andrew,’ Trump Says. Photos Say Otherwise.",2019-12-03,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — President Trump denied on Tuesday that he knew Prince Andrew, the son of Queen Elizabeth II who has become entangled in sexual abuse accusations against the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. “I don’t know him, no,” the president told reporters gathered in London for the NATO summit.  But photographs show they have met several times over the past 20 years, and as recently as June when the prince, known formally as the Duke of York, hosted a breakfast meeting for Mr. Trump during his state visit to Britain. Those photos were posted on the prince’s Twitter account.  Mr. Trump also toured Westminster Abbey in London with the prince, and they were photographed laughing together.  The prince  announced last month that he was stepping back from public life after a disastrous television interview in which he tried to defend his connection to Mr. Epstein and said he had no recollection of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has testified that she was ordered to have sex with the prince.  Ms. Giuffre, who has also spoken publicly about being abused by Mr. Epstein, reiterated the accusations in a British television interview of her own on Monday. The prince has denied any wrongdoing in his interactions with Mr. Epstein, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 on a charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor. The financier hanged himself in a Manhattan jail in August while awaiting trial on new sex-trafficking charges. Mr. Trump has sometimes sought to distance himself from people whom it has become painful or perilous to discuss, including Matthew G. Whitaker, his rejected choice for attorney general; and Gordon D. Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union.   Earlier photos also show Mr. Trump together with the prince, the queen’s third child. Mr. Trump and his then-girlfriend, Melania Knauss — now the first lady — were seen with the prince at least twice in 2000: once at the opening of Hudson Hotel in New York and, more intimately, at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.  Mr. Trump also told reporters on Tuesday that he did not know anything about Jeremy Corbyn, the  main rival of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the upcoming election.  “Jeremy Corbyn?” Mr. Trump said. “Know nothing about him.” But the president had given an opinion on Mr. Corbyn as recently as last month, on a London-based radio show.  “Corbyn would be so bad for your country, he’d be so bad, he’d take you in such a bad way,” Mr. Trump said. “He’d take you into such bad places.”']","Speaking to reporters in London, President Trump denied knowing Prince Andrew, despite having been photographed with him on several occasions.

Irish Ex-Soldier Who Married ISIS Fighter Is Arrested,2019-12-01,By Ed O'Loughlin,"['DUBLIN — A former Irish soldier who converted to Islam, traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State and married a British jihadi fighter, was arrested at Dublin Airport on Sunday for questioning about possible terrorism crimes, having been deported from Turkey. The former soldier, Lisa Smith, 38, was deported with her 2-year-old daughter on a Turkish Airlines flight with the cooperation of the Irish government, after she had been detained by Turkish forces during their recent incursion into Syria.  A small number of Irish diplomatic personnel and a contingent from the Irish Army’s elite Ranger Wing flew to Turkey to escort Ms. Smith and her daughter home. They were met at the steps of the plane by detectives from the police section that is responsible for internal security affairs in Ireland. Photographs showed a woman descending the steps, her face hidden by a pink blanket. Ms. Smith was questioned at a police station in the south of Dublin, according to the authorities. Several European governments have resisted the repatriation of citizens who joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, because of the potential security risk. But Dublin has said it accepted the right of Ms. Smith and her daughter — an Irish citizen by virtue of her mother’s nationality — to return to Ireland. Around 30 Irish citizens traveled to the Middle East as jihadis, Irish newspapers reported, and most of those are believed to have been killed or have moved elsewhere. Ms. Smith and her daughter were discovered living in the Ain Issa refugee camp this year. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday that all Irish citizens who were in distress or danger overseas were entitled to consular help. “We first became aware in March of the presence of Lisa Smith and her child in a detention camp in Syria, where the conditions were extremely poor,” the department said. “UNICEF warned governments that conditions for children there were dire, with an extremely worrying child mortality rate.” “Of primary concern to the government in this case was the welfare of a young child who was caught in the middle of a war zone,” the department added. Ms. Smith joined the Irish Defense Forces as a young infantry recruit and transferred five years later to the air corps, where she worked for another five years as a flight attendant on the official government jet, assisting government ministers including Bertie Ahern, then the prime minister.  She converted to Islam in 2011 while still serving in the Irish Defense Forces. She resigned that year, shortly after giving a newspaper interview about her decision to convert, saying she had become disillusioned with a lifestyle of drink, drugs and partying. She is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2015, despite being on a police watch list as a potential Islamist radical. She married a British jihadi and conceived their daughter. The father is believed to have been killed in the fighting in Syria. Her daughter is now in the care of Ms. Smith’s relatives in her native town, Dundalk. After she traveled to Syria, she reappeared this year with her infant daughter at a Kurdish-controlled displacement camp for wives and children of Islamic State fighters. Interviewed there by a BBC journalist, she said that she wanted to return to Ireland and denied having used her weapons training on behalf of ISIS or having been involved in any acts of violence or terrorism. “If you asked me am I going to hurt anyone? No,” she said. “Have I any intentions to do anything? No. I’m just interested in trying to bring my daughter up and get her educated. I don’t even think I’m radicalized. All I know is I just came to an Islamic State and I failed.” Under Irish law, citizens can, in principle, be prosecuted for terror offenses committed abroad, but strong evidence would have to be produced linking the defendant to specific crimes. In the BBC interview, she denied a report that she had trained girls to become ISIS fighters, saying she never picked up a gun while in Syria. “Even if I wanted to go fighting, I tried to go fighting, they wouldn’t let me,” she said. The Irish police said in a statement said that Ms. Smith had been arrested under a catchall provision that is generally used to hold and question people suspected of internal subversion or terrorist activity. In contrast to Ireland, Britain has taken a harder stance on returning ISIS fighters or adult relatives. It has stripped the citizenship of Shamima Begum, 20, who ran away at the age of 15 to join ISIS in Syria and had three children — all of whom died. The government said she would never be allowed to return to Britain. But last month, Britain allowed several unaccompanied children of Britons to be repatriated from former Islamic State territory in Syria. Last month, a federal judge in the United States ruled that Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who joined the Islamic State in 2014, is not an American citizen, blocking her wish to return home to her family in Alabama.']","Lisa Smith, 38, and her 2-year-old daughter were deported by Turkey from a Syrian displacement camp and landed in Dublin on Sunday."
"U.S. Drone Killed Afghan Civilians, Officials Say",2019-12-01,By Farooq Jan Mangal and Fahim Abed,"['KHOST, Afghanistan — An American drone strike on a car carrying a woman who had just given birth in southeastern Afghanistan left five people dead, including the mother, three of her relatives and the driver, Afghan officials and family members said on Sunday. The strike in the Alisher District of Khost Province occurred either late Friday night or early Saturday, they said. The woman, Malana, 25, had given birth to a son, her second child, at home. But her health had deteriorated soon after and relatives had been taking her to a clinic. On their way home, their vehicle was hit. After the strike, there was confusion about whether the newborn was among the victims.  Later, it became clear that the baby had not been in the car. Turab Khan, a relative, said the boy was safe at home. The United States military command in Afghanistan confirmed a strike in Khost, saying that three Taliban fighters had been killed. But the military said the strike occurred on Thursday, Nov. 28. “We are aware of the allegations of civilian casualties and working with local authorities to determine the veracity of these claims,” Col. Sonny Leggett, a military spokesman, said. Gulmir Jan, a local tribal leader, said that hours after Malana had given birth, her health took a turn for the worse and her in-laws rushed her to the clinic.  (Like most Afghans, the woman used one name.) A sister-in-law was among those in the car with her.  “Their vehicle was completely destroyed,” Mr. Jan said. Claims of civilian casualties by American or Afghan strikes often come from parts of the country that are hard to gain access to, and accounts are difficult to verify. In September, officials and residents in southern Helmand Province said airstrikes had targeted a wedding convoy, killing 40 people. But military officials disputed that account and days later released information that said a senior leader of Al Qaeda had been killed in the strikes. Civilian casualties reached a record in the third quarter of 2019, according to the United Nations, with 1,174 civilians killed and 3,139 others wounded. In its latest report, the United Nations said most of the casualties had been caused by the Taliban and other militants, but earlier in the year, it blamed Afghan and coalition forces for far more casualties than the Taliban. President Trump, during an unannounced visit with American troops in Afghanistan last week, said that he had reopened peace negotiations with the Taliban, though the declaration appeared to have caught the militants by surprise. He expressed the demand of the Afghan government for a cease-fire as a condition for peace talks, a major shift in American policy. In the deal they were near finalizing in September, before Mr. Trump abruptly called off talks, United States diplomats had concluded that the chances of achieving a cease-fire before signing a withdrawal agreement was unrealistic.  The Taliban have continuously rejected calls for a cease-fire before a deal with the Americans, saying that they would discuss the possibility only in talks with the Afghan side that would begin after any agreement with Americans. The strike in Khost came at a time of widespread violence across the country, with the deadliest attacks occurring in the north and south. In northern Kunduz Province, the Taliban attacked security outposts on the highway connecting Kunduz with Takhar Province on Sunday, killing 11 soldiers in several hours of fighting, said Safiullah Amiri, the deputy of the provincial council.

Manila Airport Shut as Typhoon Kammuri Hits the Philippines,2019-12-02,By Jamie Tarabay,"['More than 43,000 people have been evacuated and schools in six provinces have suspended classes as the eastern islands of the Philippines were lashed Tuesday by heavy rains from Typhoon Kammuri after it made landfall late Monday. The storm, packing wind gusts as high as 150 miles per hour, was battering the Philippines on Monday night and into Tuesday, after its eye made landfall near Gubat, a city on Luzon island, the national weather agency said.  Officials ordered the closing of Manila’s main airport for 12 hours starting at 11 a.m. Tuesday, and the Philippine Coast Guard ordered a halt to marine traffic in affected areas. [Update: Typhoon Kammuri leaves a trail of destruction as it powers through the Philippines.] The typhoon struck the Philippines just after President Rodrigo Duterte, joined by the politician and boxing star Manny Pacquiao, presided over the opening of the Southeast Asian Games, a biennial sports event that draws top athletes from 11 Southeast Asian nations.  The Games are scheduled to run through Dec. 11, and organizers have said that the typhoon may cause the cancellation of outdoor events on the island of Luzon in the country’s north. This year’s Games have been touted as the biggest yet, with more than 8,000 athletes competing and hundreds of millions of television viewers expected to tune in from around the region.  Heavy rains were already pummeling parts of Manila and populous cities nearby, and disaster agencies have stockpiled food and medicine. The authorities have described violent winds and intense rainfall, and have urged caution among residents. They have yet to issue mandatory evacuation orders, saying that all evacuations so far were pre-emptive. Residents were asked to check local weather advisories and government social media accounts as the typhoon continued to move toward the eastern coastlines. Kammuri, the 20th storm to hit the Philippines this year, was reported to be following the same path as Typhoon Rammasun, which killed more than 100 people in July 2014. The Philippines is regularly exposed to powerful typhoons. In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan was one of the most powerful storms to ever make landfall, tearing through the Philippines at record speed. Massive storm surges shredded the central city of Tacloban, washing whole neighborhoods away. Haiyan left more than 7,300 dead in its wake and displaced over 650,000 people.

London Bridge Attack Victims Were Advocates for Prisoner Rehabilitation,2019-12-02,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — They were two bright, idealistic young people who believed passionately in prison rehabilitation and threw themselves into a program that educates inmates, aiming to give them hope and reduce their odds of reoffending.  On Friday, a celebration of that program became the tragic last act of their lives. Both recent Cambridge University graduates, they then became victims of a murderous rampage by a former prisoner, an alumnus of the very program they had dedicated themselves to. The two victims —\xa0Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25 — died and three others were injured in what the police have called a terrorist attack in central London. The episode seized the nation’s attention and raised tough questions about the rehabilitation system they were so devoted to, and about Britain’s criminal sentencing, prison release and post-release supervision. They came from towns far removed from the urban crime that would become such a focus of their lives — Ms. Jones in Stratford-upon-Avon, in the West Midlands, and Mr. Merritt in Cottenham, near Cambridge. She volunteered with Cambridge’s Learning Together program after graduating with a master’s in philosophy from the university in 2018. She had recently applied for a police recruitment program, her family said, and planned to specialize in victim support.  Friends and relatives described Ms. Jones as warm, determined and dedicated to the idea that inmates should have opportunities to reform and build the foundations for productive lives. Her family, in a statement released by London’s Metropolitan Police, described her as a “funny, kind and positive influence” adding that her death would leave a “huge void in our lives.” “She had a wonderful sense of mischievous fun and was generous to the point of always wanting to see the best in all people,” the family said. “She was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge.” Professor Loraine R. Gelsthorpe, the director of Cambridge University’s Institute of Criminology, which the Learning Together initiative is part of, said in a statement that Ms. Jones’s “warm disposition and extraordinary intellectual creativity was combined with a strong belief that people who have committed criminal offenses should have opportunities for rehabilitation.” Mr. Merritt was a program coordinator who began working with Learning Together after graduating from Cambridge, also with a master’s of philosophy, in 2017.  “Jack’s passion for social and criminal justice was infectious,” Professor Gelsthorpe said in her statement. “He was deeply, creatively and courageously engaged with the world, advocating for a politics of love. He worked tirelessly in dark places to pull towards the light.” A tribute to him from a friend, Hollie, quickly spread after being posted to Twitter on Sunday night. “You were quite simply the best thing, completely golden,” she wrote. “Your voice won’t be lost.” In a statement released through the London police, Mr. Merritt’s family remembered him as a man who “lived his principles.”  “He believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge, and he always took the side of the underdog,” the family said. “Jack was an intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic person who was looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne, and making a career helping people in the criminal justice system.”  A vigil to honor Ms. Jones, Mr. Merritt and those injured in the attack was held on Monday in Guildhall Yard in central London, along with tributes to the emergency services and members of the public who responded to the attack — some of whom had links to Learning Together, including former prisoners.  Even as Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued that the killings showed a need to strengthen sentencing for terrorism, Mr. Merritt’s family pleaded that the episode not be used to score political points or justify a tougher approach to criminal justice.  “We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary,” the family said.  The attack came two weeks before Britain heads to the polls for a general election, and candidates were swift to condemn the attack and offer conflicting views on it, including blaming one another. Mr. Johnson, a Conservative, called for longer sentences, stricter standards for early release and a review of past releases of inmates convicted of terrorism offenses. He told the BBC that 74 people jailed for terror offenses have been released early. “I have long said that this system simply isn’t working,” he said in an interview with The Telegraph. “It does not make sense for us as a society.” Mr. Merritt’s father, David, criticized right-wing tabloids that picked up on the prime minister’s message.  Writing on Twitter, he accused them of publishing “vile propaganda” based on his son’s death. “Jack stood against everything you stand for — hatred, division, ignorance,” he wrote. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, told Sky News that he believed that the criminal justice system needed to be reassessed. But he challenged the idea that people sentenced for terrorism offenses should not be released early, and pointed to cuts made by recent Conservative governments to monitoring and support for former inmates.  “I think there has to be an examination of how our prison services works and, crucially, what happens to them on release from prison,” Mr. Corbyn said. He pointed out that the parole board was not involved in the release from prison of Usman Khan, the man who carried out Friday’s attack. Mr. Khan, 28, was part of a gang that plotted in 2010 to plant explosives in the London Stock Exchange. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison but was released last year, having served eight years of the sentence. The judge at his trial had warned about the threat he might still have posed to the public.  Mr. Khan’s lawyer, Vajahat Sharif, told Sky News on Sunday that he believed that cases of “ideological offenders,” like Mr. Khan, were especially complex. To ensure public safety, he said, “specialists need to get involved in the custodian element of the sentence” for several years before a person is released from prison on parole. Former prisoners, probation staff members, students and experts on criminology from across Britain had gathered on Friday for the fifth anniversary celebration of the Learning Together program when Mr. Khan began attacking those in attendance with a knife. He then ran onto nearby London Bridge, where he was wrestled to the ground by bystanders before being shot and killed by the police, who said he appeared to be wearing a hoax explosive device. Friday’s attack left Londoners shaken by yet another burst of terrorist violence. In an attack carried out on the same bridge in June 2017, three men killed eight people before being killed by the police. Another episode earlier that year on nearby Westminster Bridge left six people dead, including the attacker.  Both Mr. Corbyn and Mr. Johnson attended Monday’s vigil, as did London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who addressed the crowd after a moment of silence. “We come together this morning as Londoners to remember, to honor and to mourn the innocent lives lost as a result of the horrific terrorist attack this Friday,” the mayor said. He asked for the city’s residents to “take hope from the heroism of ordinary Londoners and our emergency services who ran toward danger, risking their lives to help people they didn’t even know.”']","Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt, who were killed in the attack, had worked with a prison education program backed by Cambridge University."
China Hits Back at U.S. Over Hong Kong Bill in a Mostly Symbolic Move,2019-12-02,By Amy Qin,"['BEIJING — China said on Monday that it would suspend visits to Hong Kong by American warships and impose sanctions on several United States-based nongovernmental groups, in a mostly symbolic retaliation for tough human rights legislation President Trump signed last week.  Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the measures were a response to the “unreasonable behavior” on the part of the United States. She denounced the new human rights legislation as illegal interference into its domestic affairs.  In her remarks, Ms. Hua also accused several organizations, including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, of instigating violence during the antigovernment protests that have convulsed Hong Kong since June. It is unclear what form any Chinese sanctions on these groups would take. Without citing evidence, Ms. Hua said these groups supported “anti-China forces in creating chaos in Hong Kong, and encouraged them to engage in extreme violent criminal acts.” “They have a large responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong, and deserve to be sanctioned and pay the price.” China has responded to the new legislation with strong rhetoric, but the measures announced Monday suggested that Beijing was unwilling to let the dispute spill over into its trade negotiations with the United States. It was unclear what impact, if any, the sanctions would have on the groups China has singled out for punishment. Most of the organizations Ms. Hua named do not have offices in mainland China. Foreign nongovernmental groups have already been subject to growing Chinese government pressure since 2016, when the country passed a wide-reaching law strictly regulating their operations in the country.  China has also previously denied permission to American naval vessels to dock in Hong Kong at times of heightened tensions between the two countries, most recently in August. “It’s nothing new,” said Willy Lam, a political expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “I think the major purpose of this is rhetorical: to try to convince the world that the U.S., whether it’s the C.I.A. or the N.G.O.s, is trying to foment a color revolution in Hong Kong.” But with China’s economy slowing and new tariffs looming, the rhetoric could only go so far. “China really needs this trade deal,” Mr. Lam said. China’s reaction was widely expected. Last Thursday, China vowed retaliation after Mr. Trump signed the two bills, which authorized sanctions on officials responsible for human rights abuses and banned the sale of American-made crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong. Chinese officials in Beijing summoned the United States ambassador, Terry Branstad, over the law.  Hong Kong’s police force has sought to put down months of increasingly violent anti-government protests with tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray. On Sunday, protesters waving American flags marched peacefully to the United States Consulate in Hong Kong to thank Washington for passing the law. Later in the day, protesters elsewhere clashed with police officers who fired tear gas — the first major confrontation since pro-democracy demonstrators scored a sweeping victory in local elections that were widely seen as a referendum on the movement.

Activist’s Case Hints at What Changes and What Stays the Same in Cuba,2019-12-02,By Frances Robles,"['MIAMI — The activist José Daniel Ferrer García made his desperate plea by hand. “On hunger and thirst strike,” Mr. Ferrer, one of Cuba’s most well-known dissidents, scrawled on a piece of paper smuggled out of prison. “They have done everything to me.” Mr. Ferrer, 49, has been jailed since Oct. 1 on what human rights activists say is a trumped-up assault and battery case. In his note, he described being dragged, cuffed by his hands and feet, and left in his underwear for two weeks to be nipped by mosquitoes and the morning chill. “My life is in grave danger,” he warned. Mr. Ferrer’s detention renews the spotlight on Cuba and the lengths it goes to against dissidents under President Miguel Díaz-Canel. Nineteen months after assuming the presidency amid high hopes for reform within Cuba and abroad, Mr. Díaz-Canel leads a government that bears a striking similarity to the Castro dynasty that preceded him, critics say. “Let’s not think power changed hands,” said Javier Larrondo of Prisoners Defenders, an advocacy group in Spain that has been closely tracking Mr. Ferrer’s case. “Power is in the same hands.” In a sign of how seriously the Cuban government is reacting to the international condemnation, particularly in the wake of the toppling of the Evo Morales presidency in Bolivia, the Cuban government this weekend published a 10-minute video that purports to show Mr. Ferrer banging his own head on a table while in custody, suggesting his wounds were self-inflicted. The government says that the United States government has orchestrated a “campaign of lies"" regarding the case.  Even well-known blogger Yoani Sánchez weighed in, saying the video was damaging to Mr. Ferrer and his movement. His family and supporters fired back, pointing to various ways in which what the government presented as an exposé appears to be manipulated, and argue that the shirtless man hitting his own face is not him.  The United States State Department said that its top diplomat met with Mr. Ferrer and other dissidents in its pursuit of human rights.  “The Castro regime’s first recourse is to dust off obsolete talking points from what should be a bygone era and describe any independent voices as mercenaries, subversives, and spies,” a State Department spokesman said in a statement. Since he took office, Mr. Díaz-Canel has unsuccessfully sought to improve living conditions amid widespread gasoline shortages and crippling United States sanctions. While Cuba has expanded internet access, enabling Cubans with new 3G cellphone service to post daring complaints on social media, Mr. Ferrer’s case has come to represent what can happen when they complain too much, particularly as access to the internet gives birth to new class of independent media.  Mr. Ferrer had been in custody for nearly two months when his family was notified of the formal charge against him. The announcement came after criticism of his detention from across the political spectrum in the United States, including from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  The European Parliament last week approved a joint resolution calling for his “immediate release.” In a very unusual statement in the official Communist Party newspaper, Granma, the Cuban government described Mr. Ferrer as a “salaried agent at the service of the United States” with a history of beating his wives. His former partners posted videos denying the latter accusation.  As a community organizer, Mr. Ferrer, who is from Santiago de Cuba in the country’s east, helped collect thousands of signatures for Project Varela, a referendum demanding greater political freedom that was presented to the Cuban National Assembly in 2002. That movement’s leader, Oswaldo Payá, died in a car accident 10 years later. Many believe he was murdered. Mr. Ferrer was caught up in the 2003 crackdown on dissidence known as the Black Spring, and served eight years in prison. He was one of the few members of a group of 75 political prisoners who refused an offer of release in exchange for exile in Spain. “José Daniel Ferrer could read and understand the streets of Cuba,” said José Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch’s Americas division. “My sense is that is precisely the reason they fear this guy more than anybody else.” Mr. Ferrer emerged from prison to found the Patriotic Union of Cuba, known as UNPACU. The organization distinguished itself by tapping into social discontent born of Cuba’s frequent food shortages and other hardships. “He has a feeding center where he provides lunch to the elderly and disabled,” said Martha Beatriz Roque, a prominent dissident who is close to Mr. Ferrer. “The dictatorship is not in agreement with that, because that implies leadership.” Over the past two years, dozens of dissidents  have gone into exile, including several who met with President Barack Obama in Havana in 2016 and all 13 members of a lawyers’ group called Cubalex. The exodus left anti-government activists with no legal assistance.  “I think that we, opponents, are not having our best moment,” Ms. Roque said.  Human rights advocates say that Cuba has about 100 political prisoners and that the number of arbitrary detentions each month dropped by nearly half after Mr. Díaz-Canel took office in April 2018. But that decline, Mr. Vivanco said, largely reflects the fact that there are fewer dissidents remaining in Cuba to be detained. Mr. Ferrer and three colleagues were arrested on Oct. 1 and accused of kicking a man in the head until he lost consciousness. Mr. Ferrer’s friends and family say that they have proof  the man was hurt in a motorcycle accident despite what they call fabricated witness testimony to the contrary.  Nelva Ortega said Mr. Ferrer, her husband, was beaten and lost a great deal of weight during the 25-day hunger strike, which he began after becoming convinced that he was being given contaminated food and water, and has since ended. He refused to wear a prisoner’s uniform and was left undressed  for weeks, Dr. Ortega said. She claimed that he had lost half his body mass, but was unable to take any photographs to document it. “The water that came down from the roof is what they were giving him to drink,” Dr. Ortega said in a telephone interview a few days after her first brief visit with him. “The food looked like it was ready to be thrown out, like the food you would give to pigs.” In a letter to the United Nations, the Cuban government said that accusations of torture were lies. But Alan P. Gross, a former contractor from Maryland who spent five years in prison in Cuba, said that although the notion that Mr. Ferrer lost half his body weight was probably an exaggeration, it was customary for prisoners to be fed meals infested with ants or roaches. “I lost 70 pounds by the time my case went to trial,” Mr. Gross said. “I thought Díaz-Canel would be better, because he wasn’t part of the family, and he never really had a military background.” The president, he said, is probably not fully in charge, given that Raúl Castro is still head of the Cuban Communist Party. “I had high hopes for him,” Mr. Gross said. “I still have hopes for him.” The Cuban government, which generally does not respond to media inquiries, did not reply to requests for comment left with its embassy in Washington and with the prosecutor’s communications office.  Although Cubans approved a new Constitution early this year, the changes it contained have not resulted in meaningful policy shifts. The biggest transformation in Cuba came after the Díaz-Canel administration allowed 3G service: More Cubans have been complaining online about police abuses, and when Mr. Díaz-Canel visited a community struck by a tornado in February, residents heckled him while others  filmed him scurrying away. The remarkable scene was virtually unimaginable years ago. The president is also grappling with tough challenges from Washington. The Trump administration has imposed a series of sanctions, choking its fuel supply and curtailing travel. Carlos Alzugaray, a former Cuban diplomat and academic in Havana, said Mr. Díaz-Canel has been too slow to enact measures to bolster the economy, but disputed that repression against government critics was a problem, however.  “Nobody is jailed in Cuba because of their opinions, no matter what people think,” Mr. Alzugaray said. “Succeeding Fidel and Raúl is not easy. When you are the guardian of a legacy you have a problem: There’s expectation of change, and there is also expectation of continuity.”']",José Daniel Ferrer’s arrest reflects the lengths to which the Díaz-Canel government will go against dissidents.
Prince Andrew’s Accuser Takes Her Case to the BBC,2019-12-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Virginia Roberts Giuffre recalled a whirlwind trip to London with her employer, the financier Jeffrey Epstein, when she was 17. It began at a townhouse where Prince Andrew was talking about his ex-wife, the Duchess of York. It moved on to a club, where she said she and the prince danced, and he sweated profusely. And it ended when, she said, she was ordered to have sex with him. “It was disgusting,” Ms. Giuffre said in an interview broadcast Monday by the BBC. “I sat there in bed and felt horrified and ashamed.” “I had just been abused by a member of the royal family,” she continued. “These powerful people were my chains.” Ms. Giuffre’s account of the trip in 2001, and of two other incidents when she said she had sex with Prince Andrew at Mr. Epstein’s homes in New York and in the Caribbean, was the first time she described her story for a British audience.  It is likely to deepen the scandal surrounding the ties between Mr. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in August, and Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II. The interview did not break new ground in the allegations against Prince Andrew, which are contained in legal documents. But it put a face to the woman who has accused a member of the royal family of being involved with sexual trafficking. And it drew another flood of revulsion from the British public, many of whom posted their reactions on social media.  Prince Andrew has denied the allegations, saying in his own recent BBC interview that he had no recollection of meeting Ms. Giuffre. “I’m calling B.S. on this,” she said. “He knows what happened. I know what happened. There’s only one of us telling the truth, and I know it’s me.” Ms. Giuffre acknowledged that the passage of time may have fogged her memory about the dates or places of certain events. But she said she had a vivid memory of dancing with Prince Andrew. “He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life,” she said. “His sweat was like, ‘it’s raining everywhere.’” For Prince Andrew, whose public career has already been ended by the scandal, the interview may be most significant because it underscores his potential legal exposure in the criminal cases involving Mr. Epstein. The BBC program, Panorama, reported that David Boies, a lawyer representing five women who say they were abused by Mr. Epstein, plans to serve subpoenas to force Prince Andrew to testify as a witness in those cases. “One of the things we have tried is to interview Prince Andrew and to try to get what his explanation is,” Mr. Boies said. “He was a frequent visitor. They ought to submit to an interview. They ought to talk about it.” Ms. Giuffre’s interview was a bookend of sorts to an interview Prince Andrew gave last month. In denying that he had sex with her, the prince offered as an alibi that he had taken one of his daughters to a pizza restaurant in suburban London on a night in March 2001 when she says they had the encounter. He said her memory of him sweating on a dance floor could not have been accurate because he suffered from a medical condition, dating back to his combat duty in the Falklands War, that made it impossible for him to perspire at that time. Prince Andrew evinced little sympathy for the victims of Mr. Epstein’s predatory behavior in the interview. He said he had stayed with his friend at his Manhattan mansion, even after Mr. Epstein had served prison time for soliciting a minor for prostitution, because it was “convenient.” The reaction to Prince Andrew’s remarks was swift and overwhelmingly negative. Several charities with which he was associated distanced themselves from him, he was urged to testify under oath to the F.B.I. and his brother, Prince Charles, urged the queen to strip him of his public duties, which she did. For the royal family, it was the worst public relations debacle since the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana in a car crash — stirring questions about the aging queen’s control over her family and drawing calls from the British news media for Prince Charles to take a more central role at Buckingham Palace. For Ms. Giuffre, who described a history of abuse dating back to her childhood, the alleged encounters with Prince Andrew left her, she said, even more sickened than those with Mr. Epstein, whom she described as “having a sickness that could not be cured,” or with his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of procuring teenage girls for him, and who Ms. Giuffre described as vicious. “This is not some sordid sex story; this a story of being trafficked,” she said. “This is a story of your guys’ royalty.”']","For the first time, Virginia Roberts Giuffre told a British television audience about a trip she took to London in 2001, during which, she says, she was ordered to have sex with Prince Andrew."
"As Troubles Grow, Mexicans Keep the Faith With Their President",2019-12-01,By Elisabeth Malkin,"['PARAÍSO, Mexico — Every day before dawn, a knot of unemployed men gather at the gate of a construction site, hoping to land a job building a new oil refinery that Mexico’s president promises will bring riches to this forgotten corner of southeastern Mexico. They linger until noon before drifting off in the haze of the Gulf Coast sun. They will be back again the next day, trusting that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s bet on oil will pay off for them. “He is trying to do his best,” said one of the unemployed men, Geovanni Silván.  That patience suggests why Mr. López Obrador continues to enjoy vast approval, one year into his presidency, despite a flatlined economy and relentless violence. He ran on promises to make the state work for the people instead of for the elites that were favored by his predecessors. And many Mexicans feel that he has begun to do just that: pouring money into social programs, crisscrossing the country in commercial flights to speak directly to ordinary Mexicans, slashing government salaries and forgoing the pomp of past presidents. So while Mr. López Obrador has little to show for his efforts so far, many Mexicans remain hopeful, willing to give time to deliver the revolution he promised.  The support he enjoys personally outstrips Mexicans’ opinion of his governance, analysts say.  “The power of his leadership is that there is consistency in what he says and what he does,” said Edna Jaime, director of México Evalúa, a research group that analyzes government policies. In his first year, helped by a pliant majority in Congress, he has upended Mexican politics, dismantling the policies of his predecessors to chart a leftist course intended to correct the country’s yawning inequalities. He has raised the minimum wage, won a new labor law, cracked down on fuel theft and pushed Mexico to do more to produce its own food and energy. Even when his actions have largely followed those of his predecessors, his rhetoric has departed from theirs. With a new force called the National Guard, he has kept the military at the forefront of the fight against organized crime, and deported tens of thousands of Central American migrants — all while declaring migrants welcome and an end to the war on gangs. “The transformation that we are undertaking is within sight,” he said in a speech Sunday, adding that he needed another year to make those changes irreversible. “We are practicing politics in a new way,” he said. “Now we are guided by honesty, democracy and humanism.” Critics accuse him of trampling the country’s fragile institutions as he concentrates power. His response is to say that the institutions were created by “snobs” to serve neoliberal interests — and to fill them with loyalists. He has alienated rights groups with his handling of Mexico’s human rights commission. Economic analysts argue he has made erratic decisions, sapping investor confidence, and he has convinced no one that he has a strategy to deal with organized crime. That failure is made glaringly clear with each new spasm of violence, including the murder of three mothers and six children near the United States border last month. On Sunday, as Mr. López Obrador was declaring his commitment to protecting lives, the authorities said 21 people had died in a two-day battle between security forces gang gunmen in the northern state of Coahuila. But the discredited opposition makes an easy foil for his rhetorical attacks on corruption — the origin, he says, of Mexico’s ills. And his daily 7 a.m. news conferences allow him to frame the national discussion, blotting out his opponents and even his political allies.  “He is a formidable storyteller,” said Blanca Heredia, a political analyst at CIDE, a Mexico City university. “He has won people’s confidence and almost a kind of faith.” That belief holds strong in Paraíso, an oil port in Mr. López Obrador’s home state, Tabasco, that has become a laboratory for the president’s plans to develop Mexico’s poor southeast. “You can’t touch Andrés Manuel here,” said Ana Luisa Castellanos, a former supporter and a local member of the left-wing party the president led for years before he broke away.  Rivers and land merge in a giant delta of marshland and mangrove where Tabasco lies at the crook of the Gulf of Mexico. Like the rest of the region, Tabasco has sunk far behind Mexico’s central and northern states, where billions in factory investment has transformed the economy. One of Mr. López Obrador’s main promises was to correct that imbalance. The prize for Tabasco was the new Dos Bocas refinery, part of the president’s strategy to rescue the government’s indebted state-owned oil company, Pemex, and stem Mexico’s dependence on imports of gasoline. Mr. López Obrador also launched one of his signature social programs in Tabasco, an effort to revive the abandoned countryside and bolster domestic production by paying smallholders to grow fruits and vegetables and plant fruit and timber trees. Those who skip meetings or do not show up for chores at the program’s nurseries forfeit the monthly $230 subsidy. Critics argue that the program is little more than a handout, but for many who participate, it has been transformative. After disease wiped out her coconut trees, Romana Segura Ramón, 64, had abandoned her 2 ½ acres. Now, she and her husband grow beans, corn and other crops, and have planted mahogany trees. “We are dedicated to our land again,” she said. Elizabeth Genesta, 29, said the biggest advantage is what she has learned from longtime farmers. A biochemical engineer who left the oil industry to raise water buffalo, Ms. Genesta found that it was a “titanic job” to plant trees to restore her land, and sought help.  “It’s fantastic how we all benefit from each other,” she said. It is a sign of the president’s priorities that when Congress passed an austere budget last month, Pemex accounted for almost half of all infrastructure spending, and the welfare ministry received billions in new money. Without more government investment, though, Mexico’s private sector has halted its own plans and that uncertainty has contributed to the economy’s halt, said Ms. Jaime, the analyst.  “The president’s plan to reactivate the economies of the south won’t close the gaps,” on its own, she added. Whatever the results of the long-term strategy, there is early optimism in Tabasco. Last week, hotels were full and oil workers in neon-colored overalls seemed to be everywhere: crowding early morning buses and filing off the boats that returned them from offshore rigs. José Luis Delgado Burgos, 35, spent much of 2018 unemployed before he found a job as a human resources manager on an oil rig a year ago. He gives all the credit to the president. “They had shut down the rigs and thanks to him they opened them,” Mr. Delgado said. Industry analysts argue that building a new refinery is a mistake that will drain billions from Pemex — already the most indebted oil company in the world — and place additional strain on the government’s finances. Environmental groups warn that the site’s location at the edge of the sea makes it vulnerable to accidents. But in Paraíso, if there are doubts about the refinery, they pale beside the expectations that thousands of promised jobs will materialize when the pace of construction picks up.  “Everything that is development is a good project,” said Ciro Burelo Magaña, a local lawyer who opposes Mr. López Obrador. Then he added: “In a while the sea will swallow it up, because of climate change.”  The hope of new jobs does not obscure other problems. Paraíso’s residents fear that local criminal gangs are becoming bolder. Last week, the dismembered body of a local policeman was left outside the house of a former City Council member. And like everywhere in Mexico, there is no sign that authorities have the ability — or the will — to stem the violence. In June, Juan Luis Ligonia, 40, was returning with a load of fresh fish from Yucatán when armed men stopped him and stole his truck, ending his business supplying fish to Mexico City. When he went to the police with information about where the truck had been spotted, they told him he needed to pay a bribe if he wanted them to investigate. “I voted for him thinking that there would be a change,” Mr. Ligonia said of the president. Instead, he said, “There is no improvement.”']","One year into his term, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador faces a stagnant economy and spiraling violence, but Mexicans still place their hopes in him."
Measles Outbreak Leads to Shutdown of Public Services in Samoa,2019-12-03,By Elian Peltier,"['The government of Samoa is shutting down all public services for two days to fight a measles outbreak that has killed 60 people and infected thousands of others in the South Pacific island nation over the past two months. Nearly 3,900 cases of measles have been reported in the country, whose population is just 200,000. Schools have been shuttered since the government declared the outbreak a national emergency last month.  The shutdown, which will take place on Thursday and Friday, comes amid a resurgence of measles in dozens of countries in recent years, including in the United States, the Philippines, the Democratic Republic of Congo and some European countries.  In Samoa, where vaccination rates are low, more than 150 new cases of infection were disclosed on Monday alone. Most of the victims in the country, which is part of the same island chain as American Samoa, have been babies and children under 4. The Samoan government said this week that half of the 29,000 most vulnerable children — those age 6 months to 4 years — had yet to be vaccinated. As in numerous other countries, officials have struggled to stanch mistrust about vaccinations. In Samoa’s case, the health authorities say that many people became wary when two babies died last year after being given vaccines that had been erroneously mixed with an expired muscle relaxant instead of water.  Although the measles vaccination rate among infants in the country was as high as 90 percent in 2013, according to the World Health Organization, by last year it had plummeted to 31 percent. Vaccinations were made mandatory for everyone in Samoa last month, and the authorities are now trying to accelerate the nationwide immunization campaign.  “Our children and people will never become immune to any future epidemic unless we have almost 100 percent vaccination coverage,” Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said during a visit to hospitals on Monday. “It’s the only antidote.” Mobile clinics have reached remote villages and rural areas in recent weeks, and over 110,000 people in Samoa have been vaccinated since early October, according to government figures.  As part of the shutdown this week, no vehicles were allowed on the roads, and Samoans were asked to wait at home for vaccination units to arrive. Schools had already been closed under the national emergency, and children were barred from public gatherings.  The country’s hospitals are ill equipped to handle the crisis: The World Health Organization and UNICEF estimate that the country’s main hospital alone needs at least 180 additional nurses to fight the measles outbreak. “These hospitals aren’t designed to deal with this,” Scott Wilson, a doctor from New Zealand who has assisted health workers in Samoa, told The Associated Press. He estimated that Samoa’s hospitals were running at “200 and 300 percent capacity.” Despite the government’s vaccination efforts, many in the country have turned to traditional healers, according to news reports. The authorities in New Zealand, which once ruled Samoa and which is home to a large Samoan diaspora, said that the first case of measles in a recent outbreak in New Zealand had come from the Philippines, and that the disease had then moved to Samoa.  New Zealand’s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, told the national broadcaster RNZ that the authorities were “also seeing the odd case now coming back into New Zealand from Samoa.”']",Dozens of people have died and thousands more have been infected in the country since the disease began spreading in October.
"With Brutal Crackdown, Iran Is Convulsed by Worst Unrest in 40 Years",2019-12-01,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Iran is experiencing its deadliest political unrest since the Islamic Revolution 40 years ago, with at least 180 people killed — and possibly hundreds more — as angry protests have been smothered in a government crackdown of unbridled force.  It began two weeks ago with an abrupt increase of at least 50 percent in gasoline prices. Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders.  In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos. In the southwest city of Mahshahr alone, witnesses and medical personnel said, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps members surrounded, shot and killed 40 to 100 demonstrators — mostly unarmed young men — in a marsh where they had sought refuge. “The recent use of lethal force against people throughout the country is unprecedented, even for the Islamic Republic and its record of violence,” said Omid Memarian, the deputy director at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based group. Altogether, from 180 to 450 people, and possibly more, were killed in four days of intense violence after the gasoline price increase was announced on Nov. 15, with at least 2,000 wounded and 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists.  The last enormous wave of protests in Iran — in 2009 after a contested election, which was also met with a deadly crackdown — left 72 people dead over a much longer period of about 10 months.  Only now, nearly two weeks after the protests were crushed — and largely obscured by an internet blackout in the country that was lifted recently — have details corroborating the scope of killings and destruction started to dribble out.  The latest outbursts not only revealed staggering levels of frustration with Iran’s leaders, but also underscored the serious economic and political challenges facing them, from the Trump administration’s onerous sanctions on the country to the growing resentment toward Iran by neighbors in an increasingly unstable Middle East.  The gas price increase, which was announced as most Iranians had gone to bed, came as Iran is struggling to fill a yawning budget gap. The Trump administration sanctions, most notably their tight restrictions on exports of Iran’s oil, are a big reason for the shortfall. The sanctions are meant to pressure Iran into renegotiating the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major world powers, which President Trump abandoned, calling it too weak.  Most of the nationwide unrest seemed concentrated in neighborhoods and cities populated by low-income and working-class families, suggesting this was an uprising born in the historically loyal power base of Iran’s post-revolutionary hierarchy. Many Iranians, stupefied and embittered, have directed their hostility directly at the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who called the crackdown a justified response to a plot by Iran’s enemies at home and abroad. The killings prompted a provocative warning from Mir Hussein Moussavi, an opposition leader and former presidential candidate whose 2009 election loss set off peaceful demonstrations that Ayatollah Khamenei also suppressed by force. In a statement posted Saturday on an opposition website, Mr. Moussavi, who has been under house arrest since 2011 and seldom speaks publicly, blamed the supreme leader for the killings. He compared them to an infamous 1978 massacre by government forces that led to the downfall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi a year later, at the hands of the Islamic revolutionaries who now rule the country. “The killers of the year 1978 were the representatives of a nonreligious regime and the agents and shooters of November 2019 are the representatives of a religious government,” he said. “Then the commander in chief was the shah and today, here, the supreme leader with absolute authority.” The authorities have declined to specify casualties and arrests and have denounced unofficial figures on the national death toll as speculative. But the nation’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, has cited widespread unrest around the country.  On state media, he said that protests had erupted in 29 out of 31 provinces and 50 military bases had been attacked, which if true suggested a level of coordination absent in the earlier protests. Iran’s official media have reported that several members of the security forces were killed and injured during the clashes. The property damage also included 731 banks, 140 public spaces, nine religious centers, 70 gasoline stations, 307 vehicles, 183 police cars, 1,076 motorcycles and 34 ambulances, the interior minister said. The worst violence documented so far happened in the city of Mahshahr and its suburbs, with a population of 120,000 people in Iran’s southwest Khuzestan Province — a region with an ethnic Arab majority that has a long history of unrest and opposition to the central government. Mahshahr is adjacent to the nation’s largest industrial petrochemical complex and serves as a gateway to Bandar Imam, a major port. The New York Times interviewed six residents of the city, including a protest leader who had witnessed the violence; a reporter based in the city who works for Iranian media, and had investigated the violence but was banned from reporting it; and a nurse at the hospital where casualties were treated.  They each provided similar accounts of how the Revolutionary Guards deployed a large force to Mahshahr on Monday, Nov. 18, to crush the protests. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Guards.  For three days, according to these residents, protesters had successfully gained control of most of Mahshahr and its suburbs, blocking the main road to the city and the adjacent industrial petrochemical complex. Iran’s interior minister confirmed that the protesters had gotten control over Mahshahr and its roads in a televised interview last week, but the Iranian government did not respond to specific questions in recent days about the mass killings in the city. Local security forces and riot police officers had attempted to disperse the crowd and open the roads, but failed, residents said. Several clashes between protesters and security forces erupted between Saturday evening and Monday morning before the Guards were dispatched there. When the Guards arrived near the entrance to a suburb, Shahrak Chamran, populated by low-income members of Iran’s ethnic Arab minority, they immediately shot without warning at dozens of men blocking the intersection, killing several on the spot, according to the residents interviewed by phone. The residents said the other protesters scrambled to a nearby marsh, and that one of them, apparently armed with an AK-47, fired back. The Guards immediately encircled the men and responded with machine gun fire, killing as many as 100 people, the residents said.  The Guards piled the dead onto the back of a truck and departed, the residents said, and relatives of the wounded then transported them to Memko Hospital.  One of the residents, a 24-year-old unemployed college graduate in chemistry who had helped organize the protests blocking the roads, said he had been less than a mile away from the mass shooting and that his best friend, also 24, and a 32-year-old cousin were among the dead. He said they both had been shot in the chest and their bodies were returned to the families five days later, only after they had signed paperwork promising not to hold funerals or memorial services and not to give interviews to media. The young protest organizer said he, too, was shot in the ribs on Nov. 19, the day after the mass shooting, when the Guards stormed with tanks into his neighborhood, Shahrak Taleghani, among the poorest suburbs of Mahshahr.  He said a gun battle erupted for hours between the Guards and ethnic Arab residents, who traditionally keep guns for hunting at home. Iranian state media and witnesses reported that a senior Guards commander had been killed in a Mahshahr clash. Video on Twitter suggests tanks had been deployed there. A 32-year-old nurse in Mahshahr reached by the phone said she had tended to the wounded at the hospital and that most had sustained gunshot wounds to the head and chest. She described chaotic scenes at the hospital, with families rushing to bring in the casualties, including a 21-year-old who was to be married but could not be saved. “‘Give me back my son!,’” the nurse quoted his sobbing mother as saying. “‘It’s his wedding in two weeks!’” The nurse said security forces stationed at the hospital arrested some of the wounded protesters after their conditions had stabilized. She said some relatives, fearing arrest themselves, dropped wounded loved ones at the hospital and fled, covering their faces. On Nov. 25, a week after it happened, the city’s representative in Parliament, Mohamad Golmordai, vented outrage in a blunt moment of searing antigovernment criticism that was broadcast on Iranian state television and captured in photos and videos uploaded to the internet.  “What have you done that the undignified Shah did not do?” Mr. Golmordai screamed from the Parliament floor, as a scuffle broke out between him and other lawmakers, including one who grabbed him by the throat. The local reporter in Mahshahr said the total number of people killed in three days of unrest in the area had reached 130, including those killed in the marsh. In other cities such as Shiraz and Shahriar, dozens were reported killed in the unrest by security forces who fired on unarmed protesters, according to rights groups and videos posted by witnesses. “This regime has pushed people toward violence,” said Yousef Alsarkhi, 29, a political activist from Khuzestan who migrated to the Netherlands four years ago. “The more they repress, the more aggressive and angry people get.” Political analysts said the protests appeared to have delivered a severe blow to President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate in Iran’s political spectrum, all but guaranteeing that hard-liners would win upcoming parliamentary elections and the presidency in two years.  The tough response to the protests also appeared to signal a hardening rift between Iran’s leaders and sizable segments of the population of 83 million. “The government’s response was uncompromising, brutal and rapid,” said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. Still, he said, the protests also had “demonstrated that many Iranians are not afraid to take to the streets.”   ']",What started as a protest over a surprise increase in gasoline prices turned into widespread demonstrations met with a systematic repression that left at least 180 people dead.
"Iran Used Firearms in Deadly Crackdown on Protesters, Officials Admit",2019-12-03,By Farnaz Fassihi and Megan Specia,"['Two weeks after protests gripped Iran — and quickly turned deadly — the government has acknowledged that security officers used firearms to quell the widespread demonstrations but  it has denied unofficial accounts that hundreds were killed.  Iran’s state television confirmed on Monday night that security forces had shot and killed protesters who had taken refuge in marshes in the southern city of Mahshahr. It described them as “armed terrorists” and praised the tactics of security forces for having crushed the unrest.  “Enemy cells were hiding in the marshes and shooting at security forces,” Col. Reza Papi, a police commander in Mahshahr, told the state television broadcast.   The comments were among the first admissions by the Iranian authorities that security officers had responded to the demonstrations with lethal force.  Iranian officials on Tuesday also denounced accounts of the death toll that have emerged since the protests began, saying that the number of victims was much lower but not specifying how many. Witnesses and residents in Mahshahr, in southern Iran’s Khuzestan province, earlier had told The New York Times that dozens of men had been gunned down in the marshes and that most of them had been unarmed, except for one who did fire a shot at the security forces after they had opened fire on the men at a nearby checkpoint. Between 180 and 450 people are believed to have been killed in the four days of violence that convulsed cities around the country when demonstrators gathered on the streets to protest a gasoline price increase announced on Nov. 15. In that same period, at least 2,000 others were injured and another 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists. Press TV, one of Iran’s state-run news outlets, on Tuesday quoted Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, a spokesman for Iran’s judiciary, as saying that the estimated casualty figures were false.  “The numbers and figures that are being provided by hostile groups are utter fabrication, and the actual figures are fewer than what these sources claim,” Mr. Esmaili said, according to the news outlet. He did not offer any official figures. At the same time, reports also surfaced of new strife — an indication that the government’s earlier assertion that the protests had ended was premature.  Press TV reported that dozens of arrests had been made in Khuzestan Province on Tuesday, citing intelligence officials.  Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency reported what appeared to have been a revenge killing of a security officer by an ethnic Arab resident of Shayegan, a working class city in Khuzestan. There were also reports of protests and clashes in the city of Sarbaz in southeast Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan Province, one of the largest in the country.  Sistan and Baluchistan, populated by mostly ethnic Baluch Iranians, borders Pakistan and has a history of popular armed uprisings against the central government. It also is home to Chahbahar port, a major shipping point developed by Indian contractors. Social media videos and accounts in Persian media like BBC Persian showed protesters blocking a major access road to the port and security forces armed with guns and tear gas opening fire at them. The Iranian authorities have provided little information about the extent of the protests since they began, and officials imposed a dayslong internet blackout during the crackdown that further limited the distribution of information on the violence.   They also have accused the Trump administration of encouraging the protests, singling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for inviting Iranians to share videos and other material purporting to document the crackdown.    President Trump, during a visit to Britain for a NATO meeting, on Tuesday weighed in on the protests, suggesting without evidence that thousands had been killed. “Iran is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak,” he said, a statement vastly different from other estimates. “That is why they cut off the internet, so people can’t see what is going on.”  Political analysts said evidence of a continuing repression of protesters in Khuzestan, Sistan and Baluchistan and in the western province of Kurdistan —  all with ethnic minorities and separatist movements —  could lead to a cycle of reprisals and more violence.   Some said they also had no doubt that the central authorities in Tehran would respond with overwhelming firepower if necessary to send a message to the United States and Iran’s regional adversaries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Israel. “The rapid resort to brute force was aimed at demonstrating to the U.S. that the leadership in Tehran will nip any social upheaval in the bud at any cost,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group. “They now believe they have successfully proven to Washington that not only they are powerful in the region, but they are also in total control at home.”  ']","The government said security forces had fought back against “enemy cells” as demonstrations swept the country, but it said the death toll had been exaggerated.

"Life Inside the DMZ? Scary, but There’s 5G and a Great School",2019-12-02,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['TAESUNG FREEDOM VILLAGE, South Korea — For decades, a village of 188 people has enjoyed perks that few others in South Korea have, with its men exempted from mandatory military service and its 46 households getting special tax cuts. These are the rewards for carving out a life in what has been called the scariest place on Earth. Taesung Freedom Village is the only place inhabited by South Korean civilians inside the heavily armed Demilitarized Zone that separates the South from North Korea. In recent weeks, villagers have been given another reward: South Korea’s main mobile phone carrier, KT Corp., has installed a fifth-generation, or 5G, ultrafast communications network, one of the first such systems installed for any South Korean town. “This is more useful than my own children, who all live outside,” said Go Geum-sik, 73. “Outside” is how villagers refer to the world beyond their constricted boundaries. With the 5G service, Ms. Go demonstrated how she can now simply push a button on a hand-held device to instantly alert the village mayor, as well as the community center, if she or her husband has a medical emergency. “There is no use calling 911,” Ms. Go said, “because they can’t come here.” As South Korea raced to build one of the world’s first nationwide 5G networks, Taesung emerged as an attractive candidate where the country could show off its high-tech prowess to both the world and its bellicose neighbor. When the Korean War was halted with an uneasy truce in 1953, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was created to keep the warring armies apart. Almost all villagers were cleared from the two-and-a-half-mile-wide buffer zone, which became one of the world’s most heavily fortified frontiers, dotted with minefields and sealed off with barbed-wire fences, tank traps and legions of battle-ready troops on both sides. Any attempt to defect across the border could trigger a hail of gunfire. Only two villages were allowed to stay inside: Taesung in the South Korean half of the DMZ, and a mile away across the borderline, North Korea’s Kijong “Peace Village.” No communication has since been allowed between the villages that had been neighbors for centuries, making it impossible for Park Pil-seon, 82, a Taesung villager, to find out whether his elder brother in Kijong is still alive. In the postwar decades, Taesung and Kijong became pawns in a propaganda war between the two Koreas, with both sides investing in their own model village to extol the virtues of their respective political systems. Today, Kijong is mostly empty, with its once-bright pastel paint on its apartment buildings fading, according to South Korean soldiers. But South Korea’s determination to keep Taesung populated comes with challenges; villagers are expected to forgo much of the freedom and services other South Koreans take for granted. Whenever villagers venture to their rice paddies near the borderline just 1,300 feet away, they are shadowed by South Korean soldiers. They also live with a midnight-to-sunrise curfew and a door-to-door roll call every night. When they invite friends from outside the DMZ to visit, villagers have to apply for approval two weeks in advance. Once a car enters the DMZ, its navigation map goes blank. Soldiers must escort all visitors. Taesung has no gym, no hospital, no supermarket, no restaurant. If a villager orders Chinese takeout, the last military checkpoint outside the DMZ is as far as the delivery vehicle can come. The dish must be left there for the villager to pick up. A bus comes to the village four times a day. “Transportation is the biggest headache, especially if you, like me, don’t drive,” Ms. Go said. The new 5G services are intended to ease some of the burdens. Before 5G arrived, rice farmers had to ask for a military escort to go to a reservoir a mile away to use a water pump. Now, they can do it from their homes through an app on their smartphones. With the same app, they can also control the sprinklers in their bean patches. For years, women wanted to take yoga classes but no instructors would come. Now, yoga lessons are streamed onto large screens at the community center. At the village’s only school, Taesung Elementary, students can now play interactive online games. On a recent visit, they could be seen having fun hurling actual balls at virtual targets streaming down a wall. Such amenities are important for the survival of the school. Like other rural villages in South Korea, Taesung has lost many of its young couples to big cities in recent decades. Today, only seven of the school’s 35 students are Taesung natives. The rest are bused in daily from Munsan, the nearest town outside the DMZ. At the school, students benefit from personalized attention, with as many as 21 teachers and staff members for the 35 pupils. This and other incentives at the school make it popular among Munsan parents. For one opening in the first-grade class this year, 16 Munsan children applied. “Here, you get a lot that you don’t get in outside schools,” said Heo Ye-rin, a sixth grader who commutes daily from Munsan. “When we go on an extracurricular trip outside, we pay none of the expenses because the government takes care of them.” A United States military officer, part of the American-led United Nations Command, which fought in the Korean War and stayed to enforce the armistice, gives a free English class twice a week. “We hope that when the children grow up, they will have some good memories of U.N.C. soldiers,” said United States Army Lt. Col. Sean Morrow. The troops Colonel Morrow commands are responsible for guarding the Joint Security Area within the DMZ, which includes Taesung and nearby Panmunjom, a village now uninhabited by civilians that straddles the border. It’s where the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in April last year, and with President Trump in June this year. Such high-level diplomacy has helped ease tensions along the border. Today, Taesung looks like any other rural village in South Korea, with its golden rice paddies sparkling under the autumn sun. But “don’t let appearances fool you,” said Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean Army general, noting that North Korean soldiers watch every move of outside visitors. “It’s not your average place. It’s a place where all the peace is secured by dedicated soldiers.” Villagers here often find themselves front-seat witnesses to the ebb and flow of inter-Korean tensions. Decades ago, villagers stepped on stray mines from the war and even were abducted by North Korean soldiers. When the tensions were high, they were frequently evacuated from their fields into underground shelters, said Kim Dong-gu, 50, the mayor. Despite the recent thaw, villagers still conduct an evacuation drill twice a year. North Korea’s propaganda broadcasts, once a daily nuisance here, finally faded last year when both Koreas agreed to switch off their loudspeakers on the border. “Despite political leaders talking about easing tensions, we still live with them as the militaries face off with each other,” said Kim Yong-sung, 49, a village bean farmer. When the two Korean leaders met at Panmunjom, two Taesung Elementary students greeted Mr. Kim with flowers. ”I was scared but also curious about the North Korean dictator,” said Sin Jae-hyeok, one of the students. “After meeting him, I think his image in my mind has improved just a bit.”']",
"China Is Aiming to ‘Break’ Detained Australian Writer, Lawyers Say",2019-12-01,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Chinese officials have cut off all contact between a detained Australian writer and democracy activist, Yang Hengjun, and his family, in what his lawyers described on Sunday as an effort to “break” Mr. Yang and force him to confess to being a spy. Mr. Yang, who was detained in January after arriving in Guangzhou, China, on a flight from New York, has consistently denied the charge.  Mr. Yang’s lawyers said they had confirmed that Chinese officials were conducting daily interrogations of him in isolation, shackling his ankles and wrists, refusing to allow access to any messages of support from relatives or friends and giving him at least nine pills a day for supposed health problems like high blood pressure and kidney complications. “We’re concerned because he went in as a fit and healthy man,” Sarah Condon, one of his lawyers  in Melbourne, Australia, said in an interview. “Now he has this purported diagnosis and is being fed a concoction of drugs.” Mr. Yang’s case has already complicated relations between Australia and China, but the latest accusations added yet another obstacle to easing any tensions. The Australian government is under pressure to respond more forcefully to Beijing after intelligence officials confirmed last week that they were investigating an alleged Chinese plot to install a spy in the Australian Parliament. It is not clear if the attention to Beijing’s covert efforts in Australia — which Chinese officials have denied as pure hysteria — have affected Mr. Yang’s treatment. The office of Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, who has been deeply engaged with the case, could not be reached Sunday night for comment. But what Mr. Yang’s lawyers described appeared to be an all-out attempt to persuade him to confess to a charge of espionage that has not been detailed or explained. The Chinese officials appear to be trying to make him believe that his case is hopeless and that Australia has forsaken him.  In August, Mr. Yang said that one of his Chinese interrogators had told him that Australia was small and would not care about him because he is not white and because the country was dependent on China for its trade and economy.  He rejected that assertion, according to his lawyers, in part because he knew of Australia’s efforts to help through the snippets of information passed on through official channels. Now those avenues appear to have been cut off. “There is a plain attempt to have Mr. Yang be subjected to interrogation in complete isolation, cut off entirely from his loved ones and supporters,” said Robert Stary, another of his defense lawyers. Mr. Yang is one of many writers and activists who over the years have run afoul of the Chinese authorities and disappeared into detention. He is one of a few people with foreign citizenship to be detained indefinitely over the past year or so. In December 2018, the Chinese police detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, as officials in Beijing pressed Canada to free Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive held for possible extradition to the United States on fraud charges. The motivation for Mr. Yang’s arrest is harder to untangle.  He worked for the Chinese Foreign Ministry before setting out as a novelist and commentator, moving to Hong Kong, the United States and, finally, Australia, where he studied for a Ph.D. and became an Australian citizen in 2002. After migrating, he remained an influential voice in China, using his online presence to sell health supplements and to offer lectures, commentaries on current affairs and advice on migration to Western countries. While he has often stayed within the bounds of official Chinese acceptance, he has also issued barbed critiques in playful tones. “I’m like an old auntie jabbering on, always promoting democracy and repeating its benefits,” he wrote in a 2014 article.  Before his detention in January, he spent two years with his family in New York, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University.']","Yang Hengjun has been shackled, cut off from all contact with his family and interrogated daily to make him confess to being a spy, his representatives said."
‘Incredible Story of Survival’: Woman Rescued After 12 Days in Outback,2019-12-02,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The three Australians told family and friends they were making a quick trip into the central Australian outback. But when their truck became bogged down in a riverbed, they suddenly found themselves in a battle for survival, stranded in a remote landscape with little food and water. On Sunday, 12 days later, the police said they had found one of the three people and a dog alive near a water hole about a mile away from the abandoned truck. Unusual tire tracks spotted by a cattle station worker, as well as a note left inside the vehicle, provided a breakthrough for searchers. The rescued woman, Tamra McBeath-Riley, 52, survived in the 100-degree-plus heat by boiling and drinking groundwater, the police said. She was airlifted to a roadhouse about 55 miles from Alice Springs, where paramedics found her breaking her fast with beer, cola and french fries, said Andrew Everingham, the regional manager for St. John Ambulance.  She was treated for dehydration and exposure and released from a hospital on Monday. “It is an incredible story of survival, really,” Mr. Everingham said. Although Ms. McBeath-Riley had experienced some vomiting and gastrointestinal problems, he added, she was “in very good spirits and physically quite well.”  Searchers in two helicopters are continuing to look for the other two people, Claire Hockridge, 46, and Phu Tran, 40, who split from Ms. McBeath-Riley about a week ago to seek help. The two had some water with them when they broke away, though there is “significant concern” for their welfare, Mr. Everingham said. When the truck first became stuck in the riverbed, the three stayed with the vehicle for a couple of days. But then they decided to set off toward the Finke River, and left a note inside the truck detailing their plans.  For about a week, the group stayed close to the water, either boiling it or sieving it through a shirt to survive, Superintendent Pauline Vicary of the Northern Territory Police told reporters in Alice Springs on Monday. The three had brought only a packet of cookies and beef noodles for provisions. They were reported missing four days after they failed to return from their trip. But concerned that nobody was looking for them, Ms. Hockridge and Mr. Tran decided to venture north with a satellite navigation device and a compass. They hoped to find the Stuart Highway, about 14 miles away. Central Australia is known for its remoteness — a place where phone reception is rare and the next town can be hours of driving away. It is also dry and hot, with temperatures soaring beyond 110 degrees on some summer days and dropping rapidly at night.  “We have historically seen a number of people struggle and require rescue, and we have seen some poor outcomes,” Mr. Everingham said.  The police said that the terrain in the search area included sandy dunes, hard clay, dense trees and rocks.  “It’s quite a diverse terrain and challenging terrain to look in,” Superintendent Vicary said. ']",Tire tracks and a note helped lead to a water hole where an Australian survived by boiling water. But two other people are still missing.
Hong Kong Police Fire Tear Gas as Protesters Return in Force,2019-12-01,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — After a relative lull in the protests, thousands of pro-democracy activists turned out Sunday for three demonstrations a week after scoring a major victory in elections that were viewed as a broad endorsement of the movement’s goals. The vote last Sunday saw pro-democracy candidates win 87 percent of the seats in local district council races. The councils have little political power, but the vote — a rare form of popular elections in the semiautonomous city — was portrayed as reflecting widespread discontent with the government and backing for the protesters’ aims. The demonstrations on Sunday were all granted “letters of no objection,” unlike the many recent protests that had been banned by the police. Activists have denounced such bans as unnecessary restrictions on freedom of assembly. While the first two protests were peaceful, a later one saw several tense confrontations between demonstrators and the police.  The Hong Kong protests began in June over legislation, since scrapped, that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The movement soon  expanded to include a broad range of demands for police accountability and greater democracy. On Sunday, thousands of protesters, many dressed in black and wearing face masks, descended on the harborfront district of Tsim Sha Tsui, chanting slogans such as “Five demands, not one less!” and “Hong Kongers, take revenge!” After the Beijing-backed establishment camp was dealt a blow in last Sunday’s elections, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, finally said the government was considering setting up a committee to look into the crisis. The move stopped short of addressing the protesters’ main demand of setting up an independent commission to examine how the police have handled the protests. “Never forget why you started,” read a large, black-and-white banner at the march. Not long after it started, the police fired pepper spray and later tear gas at some of the protesters after warning them they had veered from the approved route. The clashes continued into the evening, with officers firing rubber bullets and more tear gas, while protesters vandalized shops perceived to be friendly to Beijing.  There was at least one injury on Sunday, when a man who had been clearing roadblocks set up by protesters was struck “in the head by a hard object” wielded by another man, the police said in a statement. Graphic footage circulating online showed the man being bashed by a long object and collapsing onto a roadblock in Mong Kok as blood trickled down his face, though he appeared to be conscious after being hit.  The barriers set up by pro-democracy demonstrators to block police movements have become flash points between these protesters and supporters of the government, with scuffles often breaking out when people try to dismantle them. A Hospital Authority spokeswoman did not provide details of individual cases, but said two men who had been injured in the area were in stable condition. The city has been increasingly on edge in the wake of two deaths over last month: of a 70-year-old man who died after being struck in the head, possibly by a thrown brick; and of a student who died after falling from a building where the police clashed with protesters. But on Sunday many protesters were committed to showing a peaceful front to the authorities, and hundreds of parents brought their children to the march on Sunday morning against what many consider the indiscriminate use of tear gas by the police. The marchers waved yellow balloons — the color of the pro-democracy movement — while young children stuck their drawings and handwritten messages for the police outside the government headquarters. “Please don’t fire tear gas anymore, because besides making other people sick, tear gas will also make you sick and hurt animals,” one primary school student wrote on his note. Separately, protesters waving American flags marched to the United States Consulate to thank Washington for passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which authorizes sanctions on officials responsible for human rights abuses in the city.']","After a week of relative calm and a vote that boosted protesters’ cause, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and demonstrators attacked shops."
"To Make Sense of Lebanon’s Protests, Follow the Garbage",2019-12-03,By Vivian Yee and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — In Lebanon, its people like to boast, you can take in pristine mountain villages and swim in the shimmering sea all in one day.  But the country’s blond-sand beaches are now scarred with plastic bottles and its mountain streams befouled by open dumps. The Mediterranean gurgles with toxic runoff from rotting garbage. A seemingly unstoppable proliferation of trash has marred Lebanon’s water, seafood and public health. The government’s inability to provide basic services, including 24-hour electricity and garbage collection, is rooted in an agreement that ended Lebanon’s civil war nearly 30 years ago. The deal divided power between the nation’s 18 recognized religious sects, effectively institutionalizing corruption, with each group able to dole out government jobs, contracts, favors and social services to its followers.  The Lebanese have finally had enough of a system that has enriched the political elite while failing to build a stable economy or provide basics like reliable running water or consistent waste management. Over the last six weeks, hundreds of thousands of protesters have massed in the streets, chanting “Give back the looted money!”  They have already forced out the prime minister, but their goals are broader: They are demanding an end to corruption and mismanagement, as well as the crony sectarianism that enables it. The perpetual garbage crisis is only the most pungent example. It last exploded into public view in 2015, when the country’s political elite squabbled over a lucrative waste-management contract as mountains of uncollected trash fouled the streets of Beirut. A wave of protests ensued.  The stopgap solution was to build two new landfills. Three years after they opened, the landfills have only relocated the garbage crisis to the coast, and they are fast threatening to hit capacity. The $288 million contract for one landfill went to Jihad al-Arab, the brother of an aide to the recently ousted prime minister, Saad Hariri, a Sunni Muslim. According to three people familiar with the company’s operations, it is adding water to the garbage containers that arrive each day to inflate their billable weight. The other contract, worth $142 million, went to Dany Khoury, a Christian businessman said to be close to the family of President Michel Aoun, Lebanon’s top Christian leader. At this landfill, experts found, employees dumped trash and toxic waste directly into the Mediterranean. Both companies deny the accusations, but one thing is certain: At least $430 million later, Lebanon’s garbage issues are little closer to resolution. “Garbage,” said Paula Yacoubian, an independent member of Parliament who has repeatedly questioned how public money has been spent on electricity and infrastructure projects, “is like a gold mine for the political caste.” The issue is not limited to garbage — nor to a few politicians. When a controversial resort called Eden Bay swallowed part of Beirut’s last public beach last year, many Lebanese were not surprised to learn that the developer was a former son-in-law of Nabih Berri, the speaker of Parliament and the top Shiite in government. A major reason that Lebanon does not produce enough electricity for its four million people, experts say, is the powerful lobby of generator owners, whose machines provide power during daily blackouts, as well as the $1.2 billion-a-year diesel industry that fuels them. One of the major fuel importers, Cogico, is owned by Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the Druze minority. When Gebran Bassil, the son-in-law of President Aoun, pushed to buy extra electricity from Turkish power barges anchored just offshore, some officials asked why the government was spending hundreds of millions of dollars to rent the barges instead of building its own plants. Some politicians said that a government official had received millions of dollars in kickbacks, but they did not publicly identify the person and nothing was ever proved. Five years later, the energy minister, a former adviser to Mr. Bassil, proposed paying the same Turkish company $1.9 billion for more power, in a bidding process the government’s own procurement department criticized as biased. “It’s a pity to have such leaders,” said Abdo Farah, a fisherman who has trawled the waters around Beirut for 34 years, pushing farther out in search of clean fish as sewage, industrial runoff and garbage soiled the coast unchecked. “We’re living in a trash can.” Much of the sectarian deal-making takes place at the Council for Development and Reconstruction, the opaque government agency that awards contracts for most of Lebanon’s major infrastructure projects. The contracts are usually paid for with the billions Lebanon has received in aid from the World Bank, European countries and other international donors for postwar reconstruction and development.  The council’s procurement rules are “notoriously lax,” the United States Embassy in Beirut reported in a February 2009 State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. The Lebanon manager for the World Bank at the time, Demba Ba, told American diplomats that he was “constantly fighting C.D.R.’s declarations that it ‘already has a contractor’ for projects,” the cable said, “usually someone either associated with the P.M. or whom the P.M. needs to compensate for a political or financial favor.” The council has been run for years by Nabil el-Jisr, a longtime former employee and ally of the Hariri family. But its board also includes a Christian, a Druze and a Shiite who happens to be a brother of Mr. Berri, the Parliament speaker.  Hospitals, roads, schools and other projects are distributed to favored contractors according to sectarian quotas that ensure every group benefits, regardless of necessity, said Jad Chaaban, an economist at the American University of Beirut who has analyzed the council’s spending. “They’ll tell you, ‘Well, we had to balance it in a sectarian way because we can’t only build schools in mostly Sunni areas, we also have to do Christian areas,’” he said. “They hide behind sectarianism to fund their patronage networks and their cronies.” Sectarian connections determine not only government contracts but access to coveted government jobs, schools, bureaucratic favors and, occasionally, social services. A system meant to foster peaceful coexistence has only reinforced sectarian divisions, making most Lebanese dependent on the good graces of their sects’ leaders — and each sect more determined to fight for every government dollar and favor. So it was no surprise when, in 2016, the Council for Development and Reconstruction turned to Mr. Khoury, the Christian businessman linked to Mr. Aoun, and to Mr. al-Arab, the Sunni Muslim contractor linked to Mr. Hariri, to help solve Lebanon’s garbage emergency.  Mr. Khoury took over an old landfill at Bourj Hammoud, north of Beirut, with plans to expand it into the sea. Najat Saliba, a chemist at the American University of Beirut who inspected the site in 2017, found that Mr. Khoury’s company was dumping trash into the landfill without sorting it, despite a contractual requirement that recyclables be separated and hazardous material be removed.  Moreover, she found, the landfill’s breakwaters in the Mediterranean were not keeping the trash out of the water. Garbage and the toxic liquid oozing from it were going straight into the sea. The contractor has said that it was not sorting the garbage because doing so would delay the project. It told Dr. Saliba that the sea had been polluted by sewage and other runoff, not by the landfill. A lawyer for Mr. Khoury, Mark Habka, said last week that all standards were now being met. Mr. al-Arab opened a new landfill at Costa Brava, and two sorting plants. But workers at the sorting plants have made little attempt to sort much of what arrived, according to three people familiar with their operations.  They also said that they had seen workers using hoses to add water to the garbage before weighing it, increasing the cost to the government.  The three people include two who visited the sorting operation in 2017 and a third person familiar with the plants’ current operations who confirmed that these methods persist. These people asked not to be identified, fearing physical harm for speaking out. Representatives of Mr. al-Arab’s company, Al Jihad for Commerce and Contracting, contacted this November,  insisted that all the trash was sorted properly. But internal plant data from July 2018 shows that 93 percent of the waste was being dumped into landfills. Hisham Karameh, Al Jihad’s waste management director, denied that the company played any tricks with the weighing, saying the weighing was monitored by representatives from the company, the government, the municipality and outside consultants.  Despite such questions, the development council has repeatedly fattened Al Jihad’s contract, agreeing in a series of add-ons to pay the company an additional $161 million to upgrade and expand the operation, without opening the process to new bids. Mr. Karameh insisted the process was fair. “What we’ve won, we’ve won fairly,” he said. “Every businessman in Lebanon is related to someone in politics.” Both Al Jihad and the council said the company had submitted the lowest bid for the original contract. While businessmen and politicians have grown richer, the trash crisis has only grown harder to ignore. “Money from all these donating governments has been wasted in pretending to do these constructive reform projects,” Dr. Saliba said. “And nothing’s been happening.” By last summer, Costa Brava’s neighbors had had enough. Local residents blocked garbage trucks from entering, calling on the government to produce a sustainable solution. “It seems like the dumping will only stop after the trash reaches Cyprus,” said Ziad Haidar, the mayor of Choueifat, a nearby municipality. “But what can we do? If we kept blocking the road, you’d see trash everywhere on the streets.” For several years, the government has promoted incineration as a long-term solution, despite objections from environmentalists and scientists. In June, the environment minister, Fadi Jreissati, told The Daily Star, a local newspaper, that he did not think Lebanon was “qualified” to regulate the incinerators.  Less than two months later, the cabinet approved his plan to build more landfills and three incinerators. The development council was tasked with scoping out potential sites.

"NATO Readies a 70th Birthday Party, With Low-Key Celebrations",2019-12-02,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — For an anniversary bash, the guests are unusually anxious. The leaders of NATO are traveling to London this week to commemorate the alliance’s 70th birthday — but they will do so at a carefully crafted, foreshortened gathering, not at a full-blown summit meeting.  The low-key celebration seems intended to avoid more awkward comments from President Trump, who nearly blew apart the last summit meeting in Brussels in July 2018, musing about quitting the alliance and walking out in the middle of a statement by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.  Normally, the 70th anniversary, like the 50th, would have been held in Washington, where the alliance’s founding treaty was signed, with three days of pomp, substance and a White House dinner. But given Mr. Trump’s unpredictability and his doubts about the alliance, NATO countries decided to have only a foreign ministers’ meeting in Washington on the actual anniversary, in April. Despite some misgivings, including from Berlin, this session in London was added because Britain wanted to prove that it still mattered in trans-Atlantic security, particularly with its withdrawal from the European Union looming, said Jonathan Eyal, assistant director of the Royal United Services Institute, a defense research institution based in London.  According to Mr. Eyal, Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, also thought that some event should take place in Europe to mark the occasion. “There were serious misgivings,” Mr. Eyal said. “After all, at the venerable age of 70, usually one birthday party is sufficient.”  Malcolm Chalmers, a colleague of Mr. Eyal’s at the institute, noted, “This is not a summit, and the amount of time for substantial conversation among the leaders is very short, and deliberately so.” The meeting, he said, has become, “in large measure, an exercise in damage limitation — there is no intention to make any big decisions.” R. Nicholas Burns, an American former ambassador to NATO, said that originally no one had expected a British election and that “stashing it away in London,” away from Washington, “would help.” Mr. Trump “has blown up every NATO summit he’s been to,’’ Mr. Burns added, noting that NATO officials and diplomats remained wary of what the American president would say, both in the one morning meeting on Dec. 4 and at his news conference afterward. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain is also said to be anxious. He is in the last two weeks of a general election campaign, and while Mr. Trump praises him fulsomely, the American president is also widely unpopular in Britain. Any perceived interference by Mr. Trump in the British campaign may hurt Mr. Johnson. But the NATO meeting has become even more noteworthy because of another outspoken leader, President Emmanuel Macron of France, who recently declared that “what we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO.” Mr. Macron also questioned, as Mr. Trump had before him, whether the alliance’s commitment to collective security — Article 5 in its founding treaty of 1949 — remains valid, partly because Mr. Trump, as the leader of the alliance, has questioned it. Mr. Macron was also angry about Mr. Trump’s side dealings with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, another NATO leader, about pulling American troops out of Syria. French troops are also in Syria fighting alongside the Americans to combat the Islamic State. Mr. Macron’s comments were sharply criticized by Ms. Merkel and other NATO leaders for undermining the credibility of the alliance, But he has insisted that NATO is spending too much time debating burden-sharing and military spending levels — one of Mr. Trump’s obsessions — and too little time discussing strategy and adaptability in a changing world and battlefield. So Mr. Macron has made this meeting potentially more substantive, Mr. Eyal said.  “If there was any merit to Macron’s interview, which was disastrous for his own interests, it was to toss a grenade and restart an old debate: Should European security be done in parallel with the United States or instead of the U.S., as a replacement,” he said. “That’s the real dividing line.’’ Ivo Daalder, another American former ambassador to NATO, said that, beyond Mr. Trump’s criticism, the alliance could point to an enhanced deterrence after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. NATO members have increased their military spending by some $130 billion since 2016, according to official figures (though only nine of the 29 members are spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on the military, the alliance’s goal by 2024.)  Mr. Trump has also deployed more American troops and equipment in Europe alongside NATO allies in countries neighboring Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic nations. “Deterrence is strong and getting stronger,” Mr. Daalder said. But he and Mr. Chalmers, of the Royal United Services Institute, pointed out that spending was not the only measure of deterrence. As Mr. Chalmers put it, “Ultimately, NATO’s credibility depends on perceptions of the political credibility of its leaders, not on the military hardware.” “That is the legitimate question Macron is raising,” Mr. Chalmers added, even if the French president’s publicly expressed doubts damage the very deterrence he worries about. Mr. Daalder, now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs,  sees in Mr. Macron the re-emergence of a Gaullist perspective, “where France is seeking the mantle of European leadership by setting Europe against the United States.” But that may be counterproductive, he added, because it could end up “dividing the Europeans, who are already divided over Brexit and China.’’  Combined with concerns about the leadership in the United States, both before Mr. Trump and after him, Mr. Daalder said, “France is using those doubts as a way to try to establish a strong European defense identity and sovereignty.” But that feeds into American doubts about European aspirations to “strategic autonomy,” Mr. Daalder added, “and if Europeans do it against NATO instead of in collaboration with it, because ‘we cannot trust the U.S.,’ then you’re back” to the 1960s, when France pulled its troops out of NATO. Mr. Macron has defended his comments, and some analysts say they believe that this meeting may authorize a lengthy study of NATO’s future strategy, updating the last one in 2010. Drawing that out would kick the whole issue down the road, certainly past the American presidential election in November 2020.  A short final communiqué after the meeting this week is expected to mention the usual spending goals, NATO operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the need to work on new disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence and some line of concern about China. It will probably also repeat the usual boilerplate statements on Russia — focusing on deterrence, but stressing readiness for dialogue. And as a gesture to Mr. Trump, NATO has agreed to cut the American share of the alliance’s $2.5 billion annual budget, beginning in 2021, so that Germany and the United States will both pay around 16 percent. France, however, objected to what is an essentially symbolic gesture to Mr. Trump, and will be the only ally not to pay a little more. Jean-Claude Juncker, who just left his job as president of the European Commission, spoke for many in Europe when he wrote in Politico recently that “Europe must remain a strong pillar of NATO, which is not so much ‘brain-dead’ as in a light slumber from which it can be easily roused.’’ The challenge for Mr. Stoltenberg is a delicate one, Mr. Daalder said. He must try to “get through this three-hour meeting so that Trump can walk away and say, ‘I won’; to keep Trump happy so the alliance doesn’t fall apart.”  But he also needs to keep Mr. Macron content, too. Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.']","A short meeting of the alliance’s leaders in London is meant to avoid conflict, but there are worries about the intentions of Presidents Trump and Emmanuel Macron."
"In Prince Andrew Scandal, Prince Charles Emerges as Monarch-in-Waiting",2019-12-01,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — When Queen Elizabeth II welcomes President Trump and other world leaders to Buckingham Palace on Tuesday to mark the 70th anniversary of NATO, it will be another testament to her extraordinary longevity: She acceded to the throne only three years after the alliance was formed. Yet it will also showcase the House of Windsor at a wistful turning point, with the 93-year-old queen fading into history as her 71-year-old son and heir, Prince Charles, moves aggressively to assert his control, most conspicuously in trying to mop up the recent scandal that engulfed his younger brother Prince Andrew. The fierce backlash over Prince Andrew’s television interview about his friendship with the disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has thrown a harsh spotlight on the queen’s management of the Firm, as insiders often refer to the royal family. More significantly, it has also dramatized how Prince Charles has effectively assumed the role of monarch-in-waiting. In the aftermath of Prince Andrew’s disastrous BBC interview, in which he showed no empathy for the teenage victims of Mr. Epstein and offered dubious defenses of his own conduct, Prince Charles called his mother from New Zealand to press her to strip his brother of his public duties. The Prince of Wales was said to be worried that the scandal had spiraled so rapidly that it was threatening to eclipse this month’s general election in Britain, The Times of London reported. Prince Charles has long pushed for a more streamlined royal family, with fewer members carrying out official duties, drawing from the public purse, or generating damaging publicity. But the Prince Andrew debacle is the most visible sign yet that the shift has begun to happen. Some British papers all but implored the heir to take de facto control. In an editorial under the headline “Shadow King,” the Times argued that the monarchy “needs a firmer grip at the center.” “This can only come from Prince Charles,” it said. “Although he has faced his own set of scandals, he has already taken on a greater role and can do more, in effect acting as king-in-waiting.” Valentine Low, who covers the royal family for that newspaper, said that under the aging queen, “there are all these different entities in the family, and they operate in silos.”  “Andrew is a minor silo,” he said. “But you occasionally get a crisis where you need leadership from the center.” The latest crisis erupted at a time when Britain’s political leaders, paralyzed by Brexit, are in little position to help. Far from steadying the crown, as Prime Minister Tony Blair did when the queen misjudged the public mood after the death of Princess Diana in 1997, today’s politicians are drawing her into their own frantic machinations. Critics accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of misleading the queen when he asked her to suspend Parliament for a period of weeks, rather than the customary few days, in an effort to curtail parliamentary discussion and action on Brexit. The decision was later declared illegal by Britain’s Supreme Court. When the queen presented Mr. Johnson’s legislative agenda just weeks before Mr. Johnson called an election, critics said she was being exploited to deliver a campaign manifesto dressed up as a queen’s speech. “Politics, as we see at the moment, are grubby, dishonest and chaotic,” said Penny Junor, a royal biographer. “The monarchy is a rock of stability that has served this country well in times of crisis. But we’re coming to the end of a pretty troubled year, which adds to the woes of the family.” The interview with Prince Andrew raised a host of questions, not least whether the queen had signed off on her son’s decision to invite cameras into Buckingham Palace. The BBC journalist who conducted the interview, Emily Maitlis, said the queen had. But given the opacity of the palace, even she hedged slightly: Prince Andrew, she wrote in a behind-the-scenes essay published in the Times, told her team that “he must ‘seek approval from higher up.’ It dawns on us then that he means the Queen herself. At 8 a.m. the next day we have a message telling us to call his office. The Queen, it seems, is on board.” All of this intrigue unfolded, palace watchers noted, while Prince Charles was preparing to leave on his royal tour of New Zealand and the Pacific. What happened afterward was less mysterious. After four days of brutal headlines, calls for Prince Andrew to testify under oath to the F.B.I. and a wholesale exodus of the prince’s charitable organizations, Prince Andrew issued a statement in which he declared that he had asked his mother to let him “step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.” The episode laid bare a paradox: While Buckingham Palace has prepared meticulously for the death of the queen and the accession of Prince Charles, its handling of the Prince Andrew affair shows that the royal family is less prepared to handle the vexing problems that keep coming up in the twilight of her reign. Any overt move to sideline the queen would be extremely sensitive, given her beloved status. She remains a seemingly eternal presence in British life, logging nearly 300 public engagements last year and speaking for the nation, such as when she issued a statement after the terrorist attack on London Bridge, thanking “the brave individuals who put their own lives at risk to selflessly help and protect others.” But royal watchers said her grip on internal matters had weakened for several reasons. Her husband, Prince Philip, who functioned as the family disciplinarian, is 98 and lives in retirement at Sandringham, one of the royal estates. In January, after striking a car in his Land Rover, he claimed he had been blinded by the sun, in what proved a harbinger of a troubled year for the monarchy. The queen had lost another trusted counselor in 2017 when her longtime private secretary, Christopher Geidt, left after an internal power struggle. Mr. Geidt, people with ties to the palace said, had put himself on a collision course with Prince Andrew and Prince Charles by trying to centralize control under the queen. But they also credited Mr. Geidt with running a tight ship. A military scholar, he helped arbitrate the negotiations between David Cameron and Nick Clegg that resulted in a coalition government between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats after the elections in 2010. The queen’s current private secretary, Edward Young, is a less forceful presence, these people said. By contrast, the private secretary to Prince Charles, Clive Alderton, is a formidable former ambassador to Morocco who is expected to help the prince navigate his accession to the throne. However unsavory Prince Andrew’s history with Mr. Epstein, royal observers said it did not pose as dire a threat as had the unraveling of Prince Charles’s marriage to Diana. Except for potential legal exposure in a criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein, Prince Andrew is likely to vanish into memory (though not before the BBC broadcasts another program about him and Mr. Epstein next Monday). “They’ve moved swiftly to sort it out in the coldblooded and ruthless way they have,” Mr. Low said. Simon Jenkins, a columnist and author, likened Prince Andrew’s travails to a scandal involving a Hollywood celebrity. He said it was “of absolutely no consequence” in a country that is going to the polls in two weeks in an election that will have profound consequences for its place in the world. In an election debate two weeks ago, Mr. Johnson and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, each tried, in their own way, to avoid making Prince Andrew a political issue when they were asked whether the monarchy was fit for purpose. “Needs a bit of improvement,” Mr. Corbyn replied. “The monarchy is beyond reproach,” said Mr. Johnson, who has faced questions about his own peccadilloes. What Buckingham Palace needs to worry more about, royal watchers said, is Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Reports of strain between him and his brother, Prince William, and of Meghan’s struggles to adapt to her new life, are more damaging because these young royals symbolize the House of Windsor’s future, not its messy past. “For them to be breaking away from the family,” Ms. Junor said, “does have implications for the future of the monarchy.”']","After a public-relations debacle stirred questions about the role of Queen Elizabeth II, the Prince of Wales is asserting a newfound authority in British royal affairs."
‘I Wanted to Die:’ Northern Ireland Confronts a Suicide Crisis,2019-12-01,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LURGAN, Northern Ireland — On a cold February night in 2001, as Joe Holbeach was jogging along the pebbled shores of Newcastle in Northern Ireland, he imagined being taken in by the vicious tide and drowning. Days later, he stood on the edge of the Giant’s Causeway cliff top and gazed down at the steep drop, trying to find the courage to jump. He didn’t, but like many other survivors of the paramilitary violence during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. And to this day he battles the demons that tell him to end his own life. Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement ended the Troubles, Northern Ireland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Experts point to numerous factors including poverty, underfunded mental health services and a recent uptick in paramilitary violence. But a leading cause, they say, is PTSD. Mr. Holbeach, who has received a diagnosis of PTSD, is among the thousands who were caught in the crossfire of Northern Ireland’s guerrilla war, in which bombings, shootings and maimings were enmeshed in daily life for nearly three decades. His PTSD manifests in the form of flashbacks, feelings of intense emotional stress, depression and anxiety, which leads to suicidal behavior. On some days his suicidal thoughts become so incessant that he struggles to see certain objects as anything but tools he could use to hang himself. In 2001, when he reached out to his local mental health hospital in the town of Lurgan, he says he was turned away because, as he admitted, he had been violent toward another patient during his last admission. He says the rejection pushed him over the edge. “I told them I was going to kill myself, but they still didn’t take me in,” he recalled on a recent day in his living room, where family pictures decorate the mantelpiece.  “I couldn’t take it,” he said. “I cracked and went straight to the deepest point of the Craigavon Lake and threw myself in. I can’t swim well, but I didn’t even try. I wanted to drown. I wanted to die.” Northern Ireland has the highest suicide rate in the United Kingdom, with 18.5 age standardized suicides per 100,000 people in 2017, a figure that puts it among the top 15 countries in the world, the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency found. The rate for men is far higher, approaching 30. The rate in England was half that, at 9.2 per 100,000 people.  The Republic of Ireland has historically had a high suicide rate as well, though it has seen a steady decrease in recent years. Most striking is that the suicide rates in Northern Ireland have doubled since the region’s militant groups struck the peace deal more than two decades ago. A spike in the rate from 2004 to 2006 reflected a change in recording practices by the Coroner’s Service that synchronized Northern Ireland with the rest of Britain. In the following years, the numbers tracked generally higher, prompting mental health experts to carry out research that found a direct link between suicidal behavior and the traumatic events experienced by thousands during the conflict. In 2017, the highest number of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland occurred among men aged 35 to 44. They grew up in the shadow of the war, many of them experiencing daily violence, forced migrations, loss of jobs and deprivation. “For anxiety disorders and PTSD, 22 years was the average time between symptom onset and treatment, because people didn’t want to talk and ruminate over the terrible things they went through,” said Siobhan O’Neill, a professor at Ulster University who carried out a detailed study into mental health in Northern Ireland’s history. Of 28 countries and regions that participated in the World Mental Health Survey in 2017, Northern Ireland had the highest rate of PTSD. “During the Troubles, the suicide rates in Northern Ireland were actually lower than they are now,” Ms. O’Neill said. “It seems that the conflict gave those who may have otherwise been suicidal, a sense of purpose — to fight, to live.” “But when the Troubles ended,” she added, “many people struggled to make sense of what all that fighting was about and what had been achieved, and then the suicide rates went up.” The uncertainty over Brexit and the collapse of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing coalition have empowered dissident groups in recent years and threatened the region’s fragile peace. Paramilitary-style punishment shootings and beatings in dissident-run deprived areas — primarily to punish young people for things like petty crimes and drug dealing — rose 60 percent last year, an increase that experts say has contributed to the high suicide rate. Bernadette O’Rawe, an activist who provides support for the victims of paramilitary shootings in western Belfast, pulled out pictures of some of the worst casualties. A young boy with bloody bullet holes the size of golf balls under his kneecaps, another with a bulging ripped lip. Many of the victims are left crippled. Of the nine victims the couple helped, three took their own lives. “Suicide is like an epidemic here — there’s about one a week,” Ms. O’Rawe said. Mr. Holbeach was struggling and splashing in the Craigavon Lake when he was spotted by a fisherman, who swam out to him and pulled him back to the shore using an abandoned basketball hoop. As he was drowning, Mr. Holbeach had flashbacks to Nov. 8, 1987, the day he went to the parish town of Enniskillen to attend a memorial service for British soldiers and a bomb planted by Provisional I.R.A. militants exploded yards away from him. “Everyone had gathered — friends, family, children —\xa0and then suddenly there was a big bang,” he recalled, scrunching his face up tight as if reliving the moment. His hands started to shake. “I fell to the floor, and it was like asteroids coming at me from space. You’re dead, you’re dead — I believed I was dead.” The attack was among the deadliest of the conflict, killing 12 people and injuring more than 60. “I dug myself out of the rubble,” Mr. Holbeach recalled. “It was like I was in the middle of the desert in a sandstorm — stepping over bodies flat on the ground like cardboard, blood and broken limbs everywhere.” The Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi supplied Semtex to the Irish Republican Army paramilitary group during the conflict, and victims of the bombings have long campaigned for the British government to release more than $12 billion in frozen Libyan assets — currently being held in Britain — to compensate the victims. Mr. Holbeach says that beyond obtaining justice, he could use the money for private medical care after he was left injured by the bomb. About 5 percent of Northern Ireland’s health budget is spent on mental health, half of the 13 percent allocated in England. Last month, Northern Ireland’s Department of Health published a suicide prevention plan that aims to reduce the number of suicides 10 percent over the next five years, but experts worry that there is not enough funding to fully implement the strategy. A culture of silence around the conflict has also contributed to the issue, as many of the victims are reluctant to ask for help.  “It wasn’t safe to speak about so many things,” said Roisin Martin, who worked as a nurse during the conflict. “Even if you recognized that you needed to, you didn’t know who anyone really was or what their beliefs or involvement was in the paramilitary world.” Many people would not confide even in their families and friends or share details of the atrocities they witnessed on a daily basis. In some cases, experts found that parents could transmit their post-traumatic stress to their children, even if the child had never experienced a traumatic event.  Only now, 20 years later, are people starting to confront the emotions tied to their experiences. “I feel that we were so used to living with the effects of the stresses it was just part of who we were,” Ms. Martin said. Today, a similar silent and stoic response surrounds suicide, especially in Catholic communities where ending one’s own life is still widely considered a sin. After her 15-year-old daughter killed herself in 2005 in the rural county of Tyrone, Catherine McBennet started the Niamh Louise Foundation, a suicide support charity in her daughter’s name, which she says has made a big difference in raising awareness. “But we still have a long way to go, especially in rural Northern Ireland,” she said. Eamonn Baker, who works for a peace building foundation and who has dedicated more than three decades of his life to conflict resolution in the area, is still haunted by the events he experienced in his hometown, Derry, on Jan. 30, 1972 — Bloody Sunday, one of the most violent days of the conflict. Growing up, like many who lived through the conflict, he dealt with the trauma by turning to alcohol. But now he takes a positive approach by working to bring people from both sides of the conflict together to establish a dialogue. For many, the process of reconciliation has been cathartic, but the trauma of the conflict is still so deeply embedded in society that many still struggle with the emotions tied to their experiences. “The past sits like a weight on the present,” Mr. Baker said. “It’s a big challenge to live in the present.” Allison McCann contributed reporting.']","Haunted by a violent past, the territory has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

Typhoon Kammuri Kills at Least 17 as It Powers Through Philippines,2019-12-03,By Jamie Tarabay,"['Typhoon Kammuri swept through the Philippines on Tuesday, ripping rooftops from houses, knocking down power lines and leaving a half-million people huddled in evacuation centers, waiting for the storm to pass. At least 17 people were killed. Manila’s international airport was closed for 12 hours during the storm, resulting in the cancellation of nearly 500 flights. Officials suspended marine traffic in affected areas as Kammuri, packing wind gusts as high as 150 miles per hour, battered the Philippine archipelago for a second day.  By early Wednesday the storm had weakened slightly, officials said, but heavy rainfall was expected to continue. Officials had feared that flooding could deluge Manila, the capital, and   its surrounding areas, home to more than 10 million people.  In Albay, a province in southeastern Luzon, the largest and most populous Philippine island, Gov. Al Francis Bichara said fierce winds had caused more damage than the rain. “Right now there’s no electricity, the cables had fallen, but it’s calm now,” he said, speaking to a Manila radio station. The army, the police force and emergency service workers were helping to clear roads of debris, said Claudio Yucot, a regional director for civil defense.  The 17 deaths reported Wednesday by emergency officials and the national police included a man who was electrocuted when a damaged wire touched his galvanized metal roof. Another man was hit by a tree and killed. A man who was fishing along the shore in Quezon, along the south of Luzon, was struck by lightning, and several others on shorelines along the archipelago drowned. Across the Philippines, officials said the evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people from exposed areas had lessened the impact of the storm on civilians and prevented more deaths.  Still, the authorities warned of storm surges up to three feet and floods and landslides from the wind and rain in the mountainous countryside. A sizable portion of the Philippine population lives along the coast and in low-lying areas, and the authorities issued flood alerts for several regions. They also warned that landslides set off by typhoon rains could affect more mountainous, rural areas.  The typhoon struck the Philippines as the nation hosted the Southeast Asian Games, a biennial sports event that draws top athletes from 11 Southeast Asian nations. The Games are scheduled to run through Dec. 11, and already several outdoor events have been canceled or postponed until later this week. Sports like windsurfing, beach volleyball and canoe-kayak racing were either suspended or postponed, while others were held ahead of the storm’s arrival.  Kammuri, known locally as Tisoy, is the 20th storm to hit the Philippines this year.

Assange to Testify on Being Recorded in Embassy in London,2019-12-01,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — This much has become clear in recent weeks: When Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was living in Ecuador’s embassy in London, someone was spying on him, recording his private conversations. The question is: Who ordered the surveillance? Mr. Assange — in jail in Britain and facing prosecution in the United States — is scheduled to testify remotely later this month before a Spanish judge in a criminal case accusing a Spanish security company of eavesdropping on him illegally. The Spanish court case has revealed a new set of secrets in the international saga of Mr. Assange, 48, showing that his claims of being spied on were not just paranoia or a publicity stunt. But as with all things related to someone who has been labeled a villain and a hero, a prophet and a crank, the revelations are subject to conflicting interpretations. In Spain’s National Court, a public prosecutor and Mr. Assange’s lawyers have presented a raft of evidence that he was recorded while in the Ecuadorean Embassy, which they say violated his right to privacy. The material includes video recordings, reviewed by The New York Times, in which his conversations with visitors are audible. The prosecutor and Mr. Assange’s allies argue that the C.I.A. was behind the spying. A spokesman for the agency declined to comment. After President Trump took office in 2017, the C.I.A. began espionage aimed at Mr. Assange, WikiLeaks and their ties to Russian intelligence, and the Justice Department began building a criminal case against him. But it remains unclear whether it was the Americans who were behind bugging the embassy. The case adds another layer of complexity to the legal travails of Mr. Assange, who has been indicted in the United States on charges of espionage and hacking that exposed classified national security secrets. The Justice Department has asked Britain to extradite him, and British courts have begun considering the request. His lawyers plan to introduce evidence from the Spanish case into the extradition case, arguing that it should block the British government from turning him over to the Americans. They say that the surveillance includes recordings of privileged conversations Mr. Assange had with his lawyers and doctors, and proves that he cannot receive a fair trial in the United States. The British courts are unlikely to accept that argument, according to Amy Jeffress, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter in Washington and a former Justice Department attaché at the American Embassy in London. She said the legal standard is whether extradition would comply with Britain’s Human Rights Act, which protects the right to privacy but balances it against considerations like national security and fighting crime. Mr. Assange is scheduled to testify on Dec. 20 by videoconference from Westminster Magistrates’ Court before Judge José de la Mata some 800 miles away, in Spain’s National Court in Madrid. The judge is handling the investigation into UC Global, a Spanish firm that was in charge of security at the Ecuadorean Embassy during Mr. Assange’s long stay there. David Morales, who founded UC Global after many years in the Spanish military, was indicted in October, charged with privacy violation, bribery and money laundering. He denied wrongdoing, and Judge de la Mata released him pending a trial, but ordered him to surrender his passport and report regularly to the authorities. One of Mr. Morales’s early security jobs was protecting the daughters of Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador at the time, who were living in Europe. That paved the way for a contract with Ecuador’s embassy in London. In 2017, Mr. Morales overhauled the security equipment and procedures at the embassy, replacing surveillance cameras with new ones that had microphones, according to a 61-page court filing by the public prosecutor. Mr. Assange was repeatedly assured by Ecuadorean officials that he was not being recorded. In reality, he was. He took precautions like using a white noise device in an attempt to mask conversations, and the Spanish prosecutor says UC Global took steps to counteract them. The company put microphones in embassy restrooms, where Mr. Assange sometimes held meetings for greater privacy, the court filing says. And it states that UC Global placed a microphone in a meeting room, hidden in a fire extinguisher, that could record up to 12 hours of sound. Recordings were  sent to the company’s headquarters in Jerez de la Frontera, in southern Spain, the prosecution says — a charge that Mr. Morales denies. When he was detained, the police also raided his home and company, and have since been decrypting emails and information from his confiscated cellphone. The court case also relies on the testimony of some former employees of UC Global who have been granted witness protection. They said that Mr. Morales traveled to the United States once or twice a month, carrying with him hard disks containing recordings from inside the London embassy. Mr. Morales repeatedly ordered them not to talk with Ecuadorean officials about his trips, they said. In the court filing, the prosecution asserts that Mr. Morales returned from a security fair in Las Vegas in 2015, gathered his employees and told them that UC Global was going to work “for the dark side,” which he explained as referring to the United States authorities. He signed a contract with Las Vegas Sands, the casino and resort company of Sheldon Adelson, and the prosecution contends that Mr. Morales passed information about Mr. Assange to security officials at the company, saying it acted as a go-between with the C.I.A. In his hearing before the Spanish judge, Mr. Morales said that any secret recording made at the London embassy was done on behalf of Ecuador’s secret service and with the knowledge of the ambassador. The Ecuadorean government has flatly denied spying on Mr. Assange. Asked by the judge why his company had set up a remote access server to allow the transfer of information gathered within the embassy, Mr. Morales said that “there was absolutely no outside access.” Mr. Morales is accused of bribing an embassy official, paying the official about $22,000 monthly to send positive reports about UC Global’s surveillance work back to the authorities in Quito. WikiLeaks gained worldwide attention in 2010, when it published a vast cache of classified material taken from American military computer systems, most of it about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That year, Swedish prosecutors sought to arrest and question Mr. Assange on sexual assault accusations, which he said were fabricated as a pretext for handing him to the United States. Mr. Assange, who was in Britain at the time, surrendered to the British police, posted bail and fought extradition to Sweden. But in 2012, fearing that he would lose that case, he sought asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and Mr. Correa’s government granted it. Mr. Assange stayed there for nearly seven years, skipping court appearances, forfeiting his bail and continuing to run WikiLeaks. Recently, the Swedes dropped their investigation, saying that the evidence was too weak for a prosecution. In 2016, WikiLeaks published stolen Democratic Party emails that damaged the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Russian spies had hacked the party’s computers, according to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, but Mr. Assange denies any link to Russian intelligence. As Mr. Assange’s relations with his Ecuadorean hosts deteriorated, President Lenín Moreno, who succeeded Mr. Correa in 2017, pressured him to leave. In April this year, Ecuador revoked Mr. Assange’s asylum, and the British police arrested him. He was convicted of bail-jumping and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison. Mr. Assange contends he is a journalist, publishing what he receives from his sources, and not responsible if they have obtained it illegally. The Obama administration reluctantly accepted that argument. The Trump administration rejects it, and charges that in addition, he aided the illegal 2010 hacking.  David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from London, and Charlie Savage and Julian E. Barnes from Washington.']","Recordings have emerged of private conversations that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, had while living in the Ecuadorean Embassy.

"Afghanistan Needs Billions in Aid Even After a Peace Deal, World Bank Says",2019-12-05,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — As the United States urgently pushes a peace deal with the Taliban to end its costly military presence in Afghanistan, the World Bank  has warned that the war-stricken country will still require billions of dollars in international aid over many years after a peace deal to deliver basic services and sustain any potential peace. Eighteen years of expensive American and NATO military presence marked by inefficient funneling of billions of dollars has shaped an economy almost entirely dependent on foreign aid. The country’s $11 billion in public expenditure each year is a far cry from its modest revenues, which even after recent improvements barely reach $2.5 billion, officials and analysts say. The difference, about 75 percent of expenses, is footed by grants from international partners, particularly the United States. A new World Bank report, titled “Financing Peace,” addresses the idea that American and other international donors to Afghanistan see a potential deal with the Taliban as what one official described as an “out of jail card” to significantly reduce their costs in Afghanistan, particularly on the civilian side. The report warns that even after a settlement with the Taliban the country would still require financial assistance at near current levels, as much as $7 billion a year for several years to come, to be able to sustain its most basic services. About half of Afghanistan’s public expenditure goes to a security force of around 300,000 members who are locked in an intensifying war with the Taliban. Officials do not expect the size of that force, too large for its own means, to shrink immediately after a peace deal; in fact, it would be likely to grow if part of a peace deal involved integrating Taliban fighters into the security forces.  Meanwhile, the most basic civilian services are already underfunded, with the economy growing at a slower pace than the rate of population growth. More than half of the population is considered below poverty line. That has become a national security concern, as support for the central government is tightly tied to the delivery of services — and that would be even more so immediately after a peace deal, with more people expecting an improvement in their lives when the war ends. “A sudden and substantial reduction in civilian grants would risk a reversal of the gains that have been achieved, driving increased hardship and poverty,” said Henry Kerali, the World Bank country director for Afghanistan. “While Afghanistan is not expected to be reliant on grants forever, the pace of decline in grant support needs to reflect current realities.”  When the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, there was little government infrastructure left after decades of conflict. The capacity to absorb the large amounts of money that came in — about $130 billion so far from the United States alone — was simply not there. Government corruption and a wasteful system of contracting and subcontracting, both inside Afghanistan and in Washington, created an inflated economy simply unrealistic for the means of the country. Even 18 years later, nearly half of the international aid is still spent not through the Afghan government, which donors say is still marred by corruption, but rather through contracts where a major slice is simply lost on layers of handoffs and the costs of expensive international consultants brought in on projects. Often, the Afghan government has little idea of how much money is being spent at a particular time around the country in its name, struggling to keep tally of all the contracts. Khaled Payenda, a former deputy finance minister of Afghanistan, said that donor fatigue was understandable considering the war had dragged on for 18 years.  “But for me, and for so many people who believe in better aid, it’s not the levels of assistance that are important, but rather how you spend the money,” said Mr. Payenda. “Five hundred million dollars from USAID could mean two or three big contracts to big U.S. subcontractors, or a lot of good work through the government’s budget.” The current cycle of financial commitments of international donors to Afghanistan, with just under $5 billion in security assistance each year and $3.5 billion in civilian aid, expires next year. The discussion around the future of aid is happening amid what one Western official called a “perfect storm” — the government in Kabul is locked in a messy re-election dispute and also disagrees with the United States over how peace talks with the Taliban should proceed. In the West, the conversation is more focused on Brexit and President Trump’s desire to reduce costs abroad as fulfilling a campaign pledge of refocusing domestically. Afghan and Western officials say that while there is little concern about European donors reducing aid, the United States government — the biggest donor to Afghanistan by far — has signaled to expect a significant reduction at least in civilian assistance in the next cycle. A State Department spokesman said a reduction in civilian aid has been a gradual process over the years, aligned with the American objective of assisting the Afghan government in expanding its “capacity and desire for greater self-reliance.” United States civilian assistance has dropped to $480 million in 2019, from $4 billion in 2010.  “Earlier this year, the U.S. embassy in Kabul led a review of all U.S. civilian assistance,” the spokesman said. “The review endorsed the present strategy and concluded that future requests for civilian assistance will continue to responsibly decrease as U.S. policy objectives are met in Afghanistan.”']",Analysts say that American hopes for a quick deal and then slashed spending could lead to a collapse after 18 years of international aid created an unsustainable economy.
"Italians Celebrate Their Coffee and Want the World to Do So, Too",2019-12-03,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['What do Chinese acupuncture, Irish hurling and the polyphonic singing of the Aka Pygmies of Central Africa have in common? They are all examples of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity that UNESCO has recognized since it began anointing such things in 2003, racking up more than 500 different practices and traditions so far. Italy now hopes to inscribe yet another custom to that list: Italian espresso. “We know very well how important coffee is to Italians, to Italians living abroad and to people around the world who have learned to appreciate something that is also a ritual and an occasion for encounter” and the dissemination of culture, said Maria Chiara Gadda, a lawmaker with Italia Viva, who spoke at a media launch of the coffee campaign in Rome on Tuesday. Italians do love their coffee. According to the Italian Coffee Committee, a trade group, there are more than 800 coffee roasters in Italy, and more than 150,000 cafes that make espresso. In 2018, Italians consumed 5.9 kilos, or 13 pounds, of coffee per capita. But traditional Italian espresso is not just any coffee. “It’s the only coffee in the world that has a cream,” said Giorgio Caballini di Sassoferrato, the founder and president of the consortium sponsoring the candidacy. Turkish coffee, which made the list produced by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in 2013, is boiled three times, he explained. American coffee is percolated through a filter, while in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland (which tops the European list for coffee consumption per capita, he noted) coffee is lightly toasted and consumed at the dinner table, “like a beverage.” “Other products don’t have cream,” Mr. Caballini di Sassoferrato said. That’s not nothing. Espresso cream, as per the regulations drafted by the consortium, “must be uniform and persistent for at least 120 seconds from the time the coffee has been dispensed without stirring,” according to a news release. The cream, according to the regulations, must also be “consistent, a dark hazel color, with light streaks.” To be traditional, espresso must also be made using a bar coffee machine, by a trained ‘‘barista,’’ or cafe operator. The coffee must be freshly ground, and brewed for 20 to 27 seconds.  There are also regulations regarding the type of cup (porcelain with a narrow bottom), amount of coffee in the cup (between 13 and 26 grams) and its temperature, between 90 and 96 degrees Celsius. Stove top Moka espresso machines and coffee capsules do not count. “We have nothing against capsules,” Mr. Caballini di Sassoferrato said. “We aren’t against any type of coffee, we are for our method.” Though the consortium was founded only in 2014, the Italian affair with coffee dates back centuries, of course. Venetian merchants began to trade in coffee beans in the 17th century (some historians believe a century earlier), and by 1750 coffee shops had become so popular in Venice that Carlo Goldoni wrote a popular comedy about one, “The Coffee House.” Their popularity spread. “I can assure you that it if weren’t for Italian espresso and the social ritual of espresso coffee, Italy wouldn’t exist as we know it,” said Massimo Cerulo, a sociologist at the Università degli Studi di Perugia. “We cannot separate espresso the drink from the social ritual, because it is a routine, a socially shared practice.” Coffee was also a harbinger of democracy. “The public sphere as we know it was born in coffeehouses,” he noted, adding that Italy had some of the world’s oldest and most beautiful coffeehouses, like Venice’s “Florian,” Turin’s “Al Bicherin,” or Rome’s “Antico Caffe Greco,” which all opened in the 18th century.  “Around a cup of espresso you have the possibility of meeting many people, regardless of status, class, wealth, political ideas,’’ he said. ‘‘It creates a community.”  Luca Fabbri, a consultant for the consortium, noted that the regulations developed by the consortium had already improved the national coffee culture.  “Even if we don’t get the UNESCO recognition, we’ve already hit the jackpot because the Italian coffee sector is united,” he said. Last year, Italy was one of eight countries recognized by UNESCO for the art of dry stone walling. And in 2017, the United Nations organization gave a nod to Neapolitan pizza makers. Tuesday’s media launch was held at the Chamber of Deputies in Rome, and was attended by a half dozen members of Parliament from parties in the majority and in the opposition, a rare moment of concord that was repeatedly commented on by those present. “The best coffee in the world is Italian so it has the support of everyone,” said Filippo Gallinella of the Five Star Movement.  They joked that the Chamber’s snack bar — known as the ‘‘buvette’’ — was the only place in Parliament where political brawls rarely broke out. Ms. Gadda added that the staff there could use a refresher course on how to make good espresso. The candidacy now has a series of UNESCO loops and committees to jump through before a decision is taken, possibly next year. The only problem was the ill-timed news that on Monday a group in Naples had held a symposium, part of a campaign to inscribe Neapolitan espresso coffee, which has its own traditions, on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list. Mr. Caballini di Sassoferrato said that in the past he had unsuccessfully tried to reach out to the Neapolitans, who started their campaign after the consortium did. “We were caught off guard, but I wish them luck,” he said. Francesco Emilio Borrelli, a Green party member of the Campania regional assembly and the president of the region’s UNESCO commission who spearheaded the Neapolitan campaign, denied knowing about the consortium’s bid.  Instead, he found it suspicious that the consortium had called a news conference the day after the symposium’s event. “That’s quite the coincidence,” he noted dryly in a telephone interview. But Mr. Borrelli held out an olive branch, saying he would try to contact the consortium, “so we can meet and unite forces.” “Teamwork is important,’’ he said. “The only thing we shouldn’t do is lose time.” ']",Italy wants traditional Italian espresso to be inscribed on UNESCO’s list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
"From a Russian Banker, a $4 Million Mansion and a 200-Foot Yacht",2019-12-03,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — The video opens with a plaque on a bench in New York’s Central Park: “Don’t forget we are of the same blood. I LOVE YOU.” The apparent Russian-taxpayer-funded romance behind the plaque, as documented by the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny in a 29-minute video posted online on Monday, has become Russia’s latest viral story about the ruling elite’s intermingling of public funds with personal pleasure.  A reporter for Russian state television, Nailya Asker-Zade, has long been dating Andrey L. Kostin, the chairman of Russia’s second-largest bank, the government-owned VTB, according to Russian news reports. In the video, Mr. Navalny accuses Mr. Kostin of showering Ms. Asker-Zade with gifts so lavish that they seemingly could only have been paid for out of government coffers —\xa0a $4 million mansion, a 200-foot yacht and $470,000 in private jet flights in one month alone.  Ms. Asker-Zade, for her part, contributed at least $10,000 to the Central Park Conservancy, according to the organization’s 2015 annual report. That contribution — the minimum threshold in Central Park’s Adopt-a-Bench program — appears to have paid for the plaque highlighted by Mr. Navalny, which says it is for “Andrey Kostin” from “Nailya.”  “Putin’s rule means shamelessness and degradation,” Mr. Navalny intones at the end of the video, which is produced in his populist, mocking and fast-paced style. “Each of us must do our own small part to fight it.”  By Tuesday, about 24 hours after Mr. Navalny posted it, the video had risen close to the top of YouTube’s Russian “trending” list and drawn more than 2.5 million views — a success even by Mr. Navalny’s standards. His clips documenting official corruption regularly draw audiences in the millions.  VTB did not respond to a request for comment on the video. Ms. Asker-Zade, in an Instagram post, thanked Mr. Navalny for the “native advertisement.”  YouTube and most other popular platforms remain freely accessible in Russia. But Mr. Navalny published the video on the same day that Mr. Putin signed legislation that augurs a further clampdown on freedom of speech: a law that allows Moscow to declare as “foreign agents” people who publish anything online while receiving funding from abroad.  “If you get a dollar from ad monetization on YouTube, you’re a foreign agent!” a popular Russian blogger, Aleksandr Gorbunov, wrote on Twitter. “If you donate more than $10,000 to New York’s Central Park, you’re a Russian patriot!” Mr. Navalny is Mr. Putin’s loudest domestic critic, with a nationwide network of supporters that has allowed him to stage coordinated street protests across the country. His slickly produced videos speak to Russians’ anger about inequality and hypocritical, thieving officialdom. He interspersed his tally of Ms. Asker-Zade’s wealth with Russian state television reports soliciting donations for children in need of expensive medical care.  Polls show Russians’ dissatisfaction with Mr. Putin rising over the last year and a half, and flash points of protest have popped up across the country. In one apparent sign of the Kremlin’s nervousness, the authorities have raised the pressure on Mr. Navalny’s network in large-scale raids and searches in recent months.  “We don’t know about this investigation,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Monday when asked about Mr. Navalny’s video. “As a result, we can’t comment on it at all.”  The government-run news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass published articles on Mr. Peskov’s response, Google search results show.

Iran’s Leaders Soften Stance on Protesters,2019-12-05,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Faced with a simmering fury in the country, Iran’s leaders on Wednesday abruptly softened their stance toward street protests that are believed to have left hundreds of civilians dead last month, the most lethal crackdown since the 1979 revolution. The change, led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, signaled that the hierarchy was scrambling to manage resentment worsened by a brutal suppression of protests throughout the country after gasoline prices were increased by at least 50 percent without warning on Nov. 15.  The authorities shut down the internet for 10 days and deployed security forces to quell the unrest, including through the use of firearms. Unofficial accountings have said between 180 and 450 people were killed — figures that the government has disputed as baseless or speculative. But it has not provided a confirmed total.  Mr. Khamenei, who previously had denounced the protesters as rioters, thugs, monarchists and enemy agents, called on the judiciary to show “Islamic mercy” and draw a distinction between people who had demonstrated against the gasoline prices and those who had pillaged and burned public property. In what appeared to be another significant concession, Mr. Khamenei said he had approved the term “martyr” to be used for citizens who were “caught in crossfire and riots and died without playing any role in instigating them,” according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Martyr is among the highest honors bestowed posthumously on loyal servants of the Islamic Republic. Mr. Rouhani announced the formation of a committee, consisting of the ministers of interior and justice and his legal adviser, to investigate the unrest and propose compensation for Iranians who lost loved ones or suffered financial loss. Political analysts said the measures suggested that Mr. Khamenei may now believe he miscalculated the effects of a tough response on angry citizens increasingly weary of economic deprivations.  “They are adding that money, paying money to calm them down,” said Rasool Nafisi, an Iranian academic and publisher in the United States. He called it “a very important step, because Khamenei’s view is that you should not yield to protests.” Expressions of anger in Iran over the crackdown have proliferated, particularly since the internet blackout was eased starting last week. Some have drawn an analogy between the shooting of protesters and a deadly crackdown in 1978 by government forces that helped precipitate the downfall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi a year later.  The popularity of Mr. Rouhani’s government and his political party may have been significantly weakened in the aftermath of the protests. Both supporters and opponents criticized him for what they called his mismanagement of the gasoline price increase, the suppression of the protests and an apparent indifference to the pain the uproar had caused ordinary people. “We voted for the government of wisdom and hope,’’ said Mohamad Ali Abtahi, a prominent politician from the reform movement, in a statement posted on his Telegram channel. “This government that spilled the blood of our youth and made everyone hopeless is not the same one we elected.’’ Gholamhossein Karbaschi, a former mayor of Tehran and head of a reformist political party, said in a Twitter message that Mr. Rouhani’s conduct in the aftermath of the unrest had left him “ashamed” of having ever supported him. “There isn’t an ounce of justice or wisdom,” he said of Mr. Rouhani and his government’s handling of the crisis. The protests struck as Iranians are dealing with an acute economic crisis caused in part by sanctions imposed by President Trump last year after he repudiated the nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers. Mr. Rouhani was a major proponent of that agreement, which limited Iran’s nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief.  Mr. Trump called the agreement too weak and said the tough sanctions — which have deeply cut Iran’s oil exports — were part of his “maximum pressure” campaign to force Iran to renegotiate the agreement.  Mr. Rouhani has repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Trump’s offers to talk while the sanctions remain in place. Mr. Khamenei has forbid any negotiations with the Americans and told Iranians they must prepare for a protracted period of hardship.  But on Wednesday, Mr. Rouhani teased that negotiations with Mr. Trump were still possible and that if the United States lifted the sanctions the two heads of states could meet “in one hour.”  In another development that suggested Iran was trying to find ways to communicate with Mr. Trump, Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, paid a visit this week to Japan, which has previously offered itself as a go-between with the United States. “The fact that Araghchi is now trying to get Japan to maybe mediate is an indication that maybe Khamenei might be open to negotiate,” said Abbas Milani, director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University. He also said the protests in Iran may have persuaded Mr. Khamenei that he had waited too long to resolve the sanctions and the economic pressure they have placed on Iran.']","In an apparent attempt to ease anger over the killing and arrest of protesters, senior leaders urged leniency and promised compensation for peaceful demonstrators who died.

Mr. Kim attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Township of Samjiyon County, near the North’s central border with China, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported on Tuesday.  Celebrating a set-piece propaganda moment presented as the culmination of a yearslong effort, the agency carried photos showing crowds gathered in a snow-covered resort town, with balloons and fireworks in the sky. Since he took over North Korea following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, Mr. Kim has promised to rebuild his country’s moribund economy, allowing more market activities and launching a building boom in Pyongyang, the capital, and elsewhere. Tourism is excluded from the sanctions that the United Nations has imposed on the North, which prevent it from earning hard currency by exporting its coal, iron ore, fisheries and textiles. \u200bTransforming Samjiyon\u200b from a decrepit holiday town into a modern resort complex complete with ski slopes, spas and hotels has been one of \u200bMr. Kim’s pet projects. The town is on the slopes of Paektusan (also spelled Baekdusan), a mountain on the border with China that many Koreans regard as the birthplace of their country and North Korean propaganda declares the birthplace of Mr. Kim’s father, a claim historians refute. In his annual \u200bNew Year’s Day address this year, \u200bMr. Kim called on his country to turn Samjiyon into “an ideal socialist village\u200b.” He has visited the construction site several times in recent years. But the project has been plagued by a lack of electricity, construction materials and other resources aggravated by the United Nations sanctions. Mr. Kim mobilized troops and what were called “loyalty donations” from his people to press ahead with the project. \u200bDefectors from the region have reported that electricity and workers were diverted to Samjiyon from surrounding towns as the authorities struggled to meet Mr. Kim’s construction deadline. Tourism is likely to become even more important to the North’s economy in the coming months. Under the United Nations’ sanctions resolutions, countries like China and Russia must send home all North Korean workers, another key source of cash for Mr. Kim’s regime, by the end of this month. Visitors have been one way for Beijing, which does not want its Communist \u200bneighbor to collapse, \u200bto extend a lifeline. Last year, 1.2 million Chinese tourists visited North Korea, a 50 percent increase from 2017, providing badly needed cash for Pyongyang, according to the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul, citing Chinese customs data. Recent visitors to Pyongyang said the number of Chinese tourists \u200bthere \u200bwas on the rise, especially after President Xi Jinping’s visit to Pyongyang in June. It was easy to spot Chinese tourist groups in Pyongyang and \u200b\u200bit has \u200boften become difficult to book flights and buy train tickets between North Korea and China\u200b, they said\u200b. Mr. Kim made the economy a top priority of official policy in April 2018, two months before he met with President Trump in Singapore, retiring his father’s songun, or military-first, strategy, which focused national resources on building up the armed forces, including North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. \u200b As his diplomatic efforts with Mr. Trump have faltered, Mr. Kim has increasingly emphasized a “self-reliant” economy, trying to boost domestic industries and mobilizing troops for building projects. He has been particularly \u200bfocused on building resort towns, a taste some analysts suspect he had acquired when he studied in Switzerland in his teens. \u200bIn Wonsan, an east coast town, he is building a large summer tourist complex that includes beachfront hotels, water parks and golf courses. In October alone, he visited Samjiyon, a resort town in Diamond Mountain and a hot-spring resort in Yangdok to encourage the resort-planners there. In Diamond Mountain, \u200bhe ordered the demolition of \u200bSouth Korean hotels and other buildings \u200bthere that the two \u200bKoreas once operated together.  Mr. Kim began pressing South Korea to reopen the complex last year, when he first met with the South’s president, Moon Jae-in. But \u200bwhen \u200bthe South \u200bbalked, Mr. Kim said North Korea would rebuild the town on its own. North Korea has recently invited tourists from China and other countries to the mountain for hiking trips, according to news reports. Because he assumes there will be no immediate lifting or easing \u200bof \u200bsanctions, Mr. Kim has sought to weather them by promoting tourism, analysts said. At the same time, North Korea gave the United States by the end of this month to return to the negotiating table with a more flexible proposal\u200b on how to end its nuclear weapons program\u200b. The North has threatened to abandon diplomacy and perhaps resume missile and nuclear tests if that deadline is not met. “What is left to be done now is the U.S. option and it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get,” Ri Thae-song, a vice foreign minister of North Korea who handled United States affairs, said on Tuesday.']",Tourism is one of the few remaining sources of hard currency for Kim Jong-un’s government. He has embarked on a push for more foreign visitors.
"In Tense Exchange, Trump and Macron Put Forth Dueling Visions for NATO",2019-12-03,By Katie Rogers and Annie Karni,"['LONDON — President Trump sat down in a gilded chair beside President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday, prepared for what has become a ritual of sorts on his home turf at the White House: He holds forth as another leader is left to smile stoically through his jokes, jabs and insults. But Mr. Macron changed the script. By the time their 45-minute appearance at the American ambassador’s residence in London was over, the French leader had managed a rare role reversal, putting Mr. Trump on the defensive about his vision for NATO and his handling of a military conflict involving Turkey, and swatting away the president’s joke about sending Islamic State fighters from Syria to France. “Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?” Mr. Trump said, crouching forward and claiming that “many” fighters had come from France. “I can give them to you.”  “Let’s be serious,” Mr. Macron, who sat coiled on the edge of his seat with one hand clamped firmly on his knee, replied. “The very large numbers of fighters on the ground are the fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq.” The dramatic moment, which came as both leaders were in London to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the NATO alliance, underscored how a relationship formerly known for  lingering hugs, lint-brushing and white-knuckle handshakes has devolved over divisions on matters ranging from terrorism to trade policy.  This time, the deterioration took place on live television. “The president doesn’t like confrontation in person and doesn’t quite know how to react to being on the receiving end,” said Heather A. Conley,  director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Macron understands that. He’s decided the best defense is offense.” Throughout the day, Mr. Trump made news on a number of fronts in his scattershot way,  speaking to reporters for over two hours in total. He castigated Democrats as “unpatriotic” for supporting a possible impeachment, commented on Prince Andrew’s relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey A. Epstein — “tough story,” Mr. Trump said of the prince, whom he claimed not to know — and mused that he might punt on a trade deal with China until after the 2020 election. But it was Mr. Macron who was his focus for much of the day. In November, Mr. Macron — another leader who enjoys talking — made headlines for lamenting, in an interview with The Economist magazine, what he said was the loss of American leadership, leading to “the brain death of NATO.” He said the United States under Mr. Trump appeared to be “turning its back on us,” notably by pulling troops out of northeastern Syria without notice, and called on Europeans to do more in their own defense with the aim of “strategic autonomy.’’ “You have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies,” Mr. Macron said. “None.”  His remarks at the time drew a host of rebukes from other NATO allies, including from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who called Mr. Macron’s “sweeping judgments” unnecessary.  Experts said the French leader had made a valid point, but warned that his words would be weaponized by Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday jumped at the opportunity.  In a 52-minute meeting Tuesday morning with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General, Mr. Trump called Mr. Macron’s comments last month “very insulting” and a “very, very nasty statement essentially to 28 countries.”  But when asked during the afternoon meeting to address his earlier comments about Mr. Macron, Mr. Trump, a leader averse to face-to-face confrontation, initially demurred. When it was his turn to speak, Mr. Macron was direct.  “My statement created some reactions,” Mr. Macron said. “I do stand by it.”  As they continued a terse back-and-forth, Mr. Macron targeted Mr. Trump’s relationship with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Mr. Erdogan has already upset NATO allies by purchasing a sophisticated Russian antiaircraft missile system, the S-400. He is now threatening to oppose NATO’s plans to fortify the defense of Poland and the Baltic countries if the alliance does not join him in labeling some Kurdish groups as terrorists.  Mr. Trump has maintained a soft touch with Mr. Erdogan, including giving the green light for the Turkish leader to advance troops into Northern Syria in an offensive against Kurdish-led forces that had been allied with the United States. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump would not say whether he would impose sanctions on Turkey for buying the missile system. Mr. Macron was harsher, saying that the purchase would need to be explained and that there would need to be common ground on classifying different groups of fighters as terrorists. “When I look at Turkey, they are fighting against those who fight with us,” he said. “Who is the enemy today?” During several appearances before reporters, Mr. Trump found several chances to effectively highlight a foreign policy achievement he hopes will help his re-election campaign: getting allies to pay more toward the costs of running NATO. “What I’m liking about NATO is that a lot of countries have stepped up, really, I think, at my behest,” Mr. Trump said.  But Mr. Macron made it clear that while he wanted more military spending by European countries, NATO had other challenges to address besides “just numbers.” “I’m sorry to say that we don’t have the same definition of terrorism around the table,” Mr. Macron said. Throughout the icy exchange, clear disagreements between the two leaders over how to deal with Mr. Erdogan’s approach in Syria even overshadowed the issue of France imposing taxes on American tech giants, and a potential retaliatory tariff on French wines. “We tax wine and we have other taxes scheduled,” Mr. Trump said. “But we’d rather not do that. But that’s the way it works.” Mr. Trump slumped back in his chair, while Mr. Macron sat on the edge of his chair, bobbing and gesturing energetically. Mr. Macron’s aggressive approach appeared at times to unsettle Mr. Trump, who said at one point that he did not support Iranian protesters who are calling for an end to the Islamic Republic’s government and the downfall of its leaders. That appeared to contradict his own administration’s position and the recent comments of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but Mr. Trump quickly clarified his position with a Tweet saying that the “United States of America supports the brave people of Iran.”  In the past, Mr. Trump has been so disruptive at NATO meetings that he triggered an emergency session. He has accused other member countries of shortchanging the United States on military spending, and he has called the alliance “obsolete,” questioning whether it still served a purpose. A goal of the current meeting was to avoid any formal disruptions. But Ian Lesser, a former American official who directs the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, said that the subtext of Mr. Macron’s criticism of NATO was growing doubt about Washington’s commitment. “When he says ‘brain death,’ Macron’s talking about American leadership,’’ Mr. Lesser said. “That’s perhaps what Trump is hearing. Trump’s view is that he’s turned NATO around, and the rhetoric from Paris is compromising that narrative.’’ Experts in the region said that with Britain moving toward leaving the European Union and the German government enmeshed in its own political troubles, Mr. Macron saw an opportunity to assert French leadership in Europe. “President Macron is seizing that moment, seeking to be disruptive in his own way, and so we will see how that works,” Ms. Conley said. “He’s increasingly isolating himself within Europe.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron appeared to have reached at least some détente by Tuesday evening: they emerged from the presidential limo together for a reception of world leaders at 10 Downing Street. In the background of this global drama is Mr. Trump’s possible impeachment. On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee is set to question legal experts about whether there are grounds to impeach Mr. Trump for pressuring Ukraine to take actions that could help him in the 2020 election. Several times through the day, Mr. Trump turned his attention back to impeachment, castigating the effort led by Democrats as “unpatriotic. ”And he again defended his behavior during a July call with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky — an interaction that formed the basis for the inquiry. “I did nothing wrong,” Mr. Trump said of the impeachment inquiry during a bilateral meeting with Mr. Stoltenberg, adding that he did not feel that a censure from Congress was justified, either. “You don’t censure somebody when they did nothing wrong.” On Tuesday, Mr. Trump also met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and hosted a private fund-raising round table with supporters, which Trump campaign officials said raised $3 million. Notably absent from the president’s schedule was a one-on-one meeting with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who is campaigning ahead of a Dec. 12 election and has been desperate to keep Mr. Trump at arm’s length.  Mr. Johnson is managing the political fallout from a terrorist attack on Friday in central London, where a lone extremist fatally stabbed two people and wounded three others. A chief concern in Britain is that Mr. Trump could change the course of next week’s election, intentionally or not, by sending inflammatory tweets or wading into local politics in interviews. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump indicated that he would respect Mr. Johnson’s wishes and not interfere in the impending election.  “I’ll stay out of the election,” Mr. Trump said. “I think Boris is very capable and he will do a good job.” Steven Erlanger contributed reporting.']",President Trump said a warning from President Emmanuel Macron of France that Europe could no longer assume American support was “a very dangerous statement.” Mr. Macron said he stood by it. 
Kim Jong-un Visits Sacred Mountain on Horseback. Analysts Watch His Next Move.,2019-12-04,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, this week took a second ride in less than two months on a white horse to the country’s sacred, snow-covered Mount Paektu. The images showing him “riding a steed through knee-high virgin snow” may look like typical propaganda.  But analysts are holding their breath because of the timing of his visit. In the past, Mr. Kim had often gone to the mountain \u200bon the Chinese border and the nearby Samjiyon County — which are venerated as the birthplace of the North Korean regime — when he wanted to show his people and the outside world his resolve before a major policy shift. “Kim Jong-un wanted to signal\u200b at home and abroad\u200b that North Korea will go its own way, concluding that there is nothing it can expect from dealing with President Trump,” said Lee Byong-chul, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. “We will see an escalation of tensions\u200b.” \u200bMr. \u200bKim traveled to \u200bMount Paektu in 2013, just two weeks before he executed Jang Song-thaek, \u200bhis uncle and the No. 2 in his regime. He visited there again in December 2017, shortly after his country successfully launched its Hawsong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile and declared itself a nuclear power. Weeks later, in his New Year’s Day speech, he started a flurry of diplomatic engagement\u200bs\u200b \u200bthat led to his summit meetings with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and President Trump. Now, Mr. Kim is widely expected to make another policy shift in coming weeks, as his diplomacy with Mr. Trump has failed to bring about the benefits he had sought, especially the lifting or easing of sanctions over his weapons programs. In recent weeks, North Korea has repeatedly warned that Washington has until the end of December to make a new, more flexible proposal on how to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The warning raised fears that Mr. Kim would abandon diplomacy and perhaps resume missile and nuclear tests. Washington has dismissed the deadline as “artificial,” and North Korea said on Wednesday that it would convene the Central Committee of its ruling Workers’ Party this month\u200b to “discuss and decide on crucial issues\u200b,” given “the changed situation at home and abroad\u200b.” If visits to Mount Paektu are symbolic gestures, the Central Committee meeting is the traditional venue where Mr. Kim typically adopts major policy shifts. In one such meeting in 2013, Mr. Kim declared the byongjin — or “parallel” and simultaneous — pursuit of economic growth and a nuclear arsenal. In a meeting in April 2018, two months before his first meeting with Mr. Trump, he declared that since he had completed his nuclear force, he would adopt a “new strategic line” of focusing entirely on economic growth. But as Mr. Kim’s diplomacy with Mr. Trump faltered, North Korea warned this year that its leader would find “a new way,” signaling that there would be another major policy shift. The upcoming Central Committee meeting could see Mr. Kim “declaring an end to denuclearization talks and reaffirming his country’s status as a nuclear power,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior North Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. Mr. Cheong said it was noteworthy that Mr. Kim chose top military leaders to accompany him on the trip to Mount Paektu, a visit captured in dozens of photos released by the North’s state media. Although Mr. Kim has visited Mount Paektu or Samjiyon nine times since taking power, this trip was the first time he was accompanied mainly by top military field commanders, analysts said. “This signals that Kim Jong-un is likely to start paying more attention to the military and focus on strengthening \u200bits power,” Mr. Cheong said. \u200bMount Paektu is a rare symbol of Korean unity, with both North and South Koreans considering it the birthplace of their nations. When Mr. Moon visited the North, Mr. Kim took him to the mountain. But North Korea has also made the mountain the centerpiece of its propaganda. School textbooks and museum paintings there depict the plain around the mountain as the battleground where a small band of Korean guerrillas led by Kim Il-sung, Mr. Kim’s grandfather and the founder of North Korea, fought Japanese colonialists in extreme weather on foot or on horseback, eventually leading the Koreans to liberation. The North says that Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, was born in one of the “secret guerrilla camps” there, a claim outside historians have refuted. According to North Korea, the Kim family’s revolution will not end until North and South Korea are reunified and freed forever from the “imperialist” influence of the United States. The 71 photos of Mr. Kim’s latest trip to the region were carefully choreographed to reinforce that \u200bpropaganda: He led a group of military generals on horseback through paths cut through deep snow to visit the old guerrillas’ secret camp\u200b sites. Mr. Kim was accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol-ju, just as his grandfather Kim Il-sung used to be followed by his wife and a fellow guerrilla, Kim Jong-suk.  Kim Jong-un and his generals huddled around a bonfire, re-enacting a scene from the “arduous march” the Koreans undertook in their struggle against foreign powers. “To outsiders, this may come across as crude and even comic propaganda,” Mr. Lee said. “But this is the North Korean way of showing resolve and comradeship in the face of a difficult challenge, evoking the memories of the Koreans’ struggle against the Japanese.” As his diplomacy with Mr. Trump has failed to ease sanctions, Mr. Kim has \u200b\u200bexhorted his people to build a “self-reliant” economy and brace for a protracted standoff with the Americans. \u200b On Wednesday, North Korean news media said Mr. Kim had visited Mount Paektu to inspire his people to resist “the unprecedented blockade and pressure imposed by the imperialists” and prepare themselves for “the harshness and protracted character of our revolution.” Mr. Trump, for his part, said he still had “a good relationship” \u200band “confidence” \u200bin Mr. Kim. But he also revived the possibility of using force against North Korea\u200b. “We’re by far the most powerful country in the world,” he said as he met with NATO leaders in London on Tuesday. \u200b “And, hopefully, we don’t have to use it, but if we do, we’ll use it.” On Wednesday, North Korea vowed to retaliate if the United States used military force.  “One thing I would like to make clear is that the use of armed forces is not the privilege of the U.S. only,” Pak Jong-chon, chief of the general staff of the North Korean People’s Army, said in a statement. \u200b ']","The North Korean leader has often visited Mount Paektu, near the border with China, before making major policy shifts."
"For Trump and Europe, a Surprising Role Reversal",2019-12-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — President Trump has always relished throwing European leaders off balance, antagonizing allies, embracing insurgents and setting off a frantic contest for how best to deal with him. Now, as Europe undergoes dizzying political changes of its own, it is throwing Mr. Trump off balance. In London for a NATO summit meeting, Mr. Trump was subjected to a rare tongue-lashing on trade and terrorism by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who dismissed his attempt to lighten the mood with a curt, “Let’s be serious.” Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump held his own tongue about British politics, heeding Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plea not to barge into Britain’s election at the 11th hour. For a president who prides himself on being the Great Disrupter, it was a startling turnabout, one that underscored how Europe’s shifting landscape — with an ambitious president in France, a lame-duck leader in Germany and a breakaway populist in Britain — has scrambled the calculus for Mr. Trump. For now, at least, Mr. Macron has replaced Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as Mr. Trump’s chief antagonist on the Continent. The French president’s recent assertion that NATO was exhausted and strategically adrift — or in a state of “brain death” as he put it in an interview with The Economist last month — angered both Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel and has created an improbable, if perhaps fleeting, alignment between those two leaders who spent much of the last three years on opposite poles. As for Mr. Johnson, his most natural ally, Mr. Trump bridled almost visibly as he tried to stay out of the British election on Dec. 12. “I don’t want to complicate it,” he said, in a grudging admission that he is so unpopular in Britain that a full-throated endorsement of the prime minister could backfire. When NATO decided to mark its 70th anniversary with a meeting in London, the goal was to limit the potential for disruption from Mr. Trump if it were held in Washington. As luck would have it, the summit wound up falling in the final 10 days of an election campaign in which Mr. Trump has been a recurring issue.  “Trump is in an awkward position right now,” said Lewis A. Lukens, who served as acting ambassador to Britain in the first months of the Trump presidency. “His instincts are to pull Johnson close, but he will have been told by his team that any intervention would be counterproductive.” Since Mr. Trump took office, Europeans have labored to adjust to his prejudices and preferences. They praised him for his success in calling on NATO members to increase their payments to the alliance, flattered him with invitations to military parades, as Mr. Macron once did, and stoically bore his attacks on their trade surpluses with the United States, like Ms. Merkel has. But Europe is changing, too, with Britain seeking to leave, Ms. Merkel nearing the end of her tenure, and Mr. Macron staking his claim to European leadership with a vision of the future that depends less on the United States. His criticism of NATO is inevitably, if indirectly, a criticism of Mr. Trump and his “America First” policy. As Europe changes, Mr. Trump is finding that he has to recalibrate his approach. With his own re-election campaign looming, he also wants credit for what he views as his foreign policy accomplishments, including NATO. On the first day of his London trip, it made for some remarkable political theater. The president who once threatened to pull the United States out of NATO suddenly emerged as the alliance’s defender. The president who once exchanged a death-grip handshake with Mr. Macron sat by wordlessly while his much-younger counterpart lectured him on the need to fight the Islamic State. The president who championed Brexit and hectored Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, about her deal-making skills suddenly had nothing to say about it. Asked about the British election, Mr. Trump resorted to talking about how his campaigning had helped Republican gubernatorial candidates in Kentucky and Louisiana — never mind that both men lost — before implicitly acknowledging that his involvement in Britain would probably not help. “I love this country,” Mr. Trump said. “I love a lot of countries, but I’m representing the U.S. They may not like me because I’m representing us, and I represent us strong.” The president has always viewed statecraft as both highly personal and strictly transactional, which makes some experts wary of drawing overly broad conclusions from Mr. Trump’s early performance in London. His clash with Mr. Macron, they said, may reflect as much personal pique about Mr. Macron’s assertive style as basic disagreements over the future of NATO. “At the moment, Macron has replaced Merkel as his nemesis,” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, “but I could see them working together in a few months.” “There is a general alignment of their critiques on NATO,” Mr. Wright continued. “Macron says NATO should focus on terrorism; Trump says NATO should focus on terrorism and the Middle East. Macron says Russia is not such a big threat; Trump says Russia is not such a big threat.” If anything, he said, other NATO members have worried that the two leaders would ally too closely behind a vision for the alliance that dials back the clock — away from strategic rivals like China and toward the quagmires of the Middle East. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet Ms. Merkel on Wednesday, and history suggests it will be a far less tempestuous encounter than he had with Mr. Macron. Still, there is little evidence that he will develop any closer ties with the chancellor in her waning years than he did with Mrs. May. Likewise, Mr. Trump’s newfound discretion on British politics will probably last only until Dec. 12, when Britons go to the polls, if that long. If Mr. Johnson is successful in winning a parliamentary majority and takes Britain out of the European Union, he will be more dependent than ever on his relationship with Mr. Trump, particularly since he has sold Brexit on the promise that he can cut a lucrative trade deal with the United States. Mr. Johnson’s Labour Party opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, is trying to stoke fears that Mr. Trump will demand that a Conservative-led government open up Britain’s revered National Health Service to American drug companies. On his last trip to London, Mr. Trump declared that “everything will be on the table” in a negotiation, including the National Health Service, before walking back his comments the following day. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he did not even know how those rumors got started. “We have absolutely nothing to do with it, and we wouldn’t want to,” he said. “If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we’d want nothing to do with it.” Even the ceremonial parts of Mr. Trump’s schedule attested to a changing of the guard. Before attending a reception given by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening, the president and the first lady, Melania Trump, visited Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, at their residence, Clarence House. Prince Charles has assumed a more central role in the royal family’s affairs in the aftermath of the scandal involving Prince Andrew’s ties with the disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew, who had withdrawn from public life, was conspicuously absent from the festivities on Tuesday. “I don’t know Prince Andrew, but it’s a tough story,” said Mr. Trump, who was photographed with the prince during his state visit to London earlier this year and at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate, nearly two decades ago.']","Where the president once kept European leaders off balance, Europe’s shifting landscape now has the Great Disrupter scrambling to recalibrate his approach."
Threats and Abuse on Campaign Trail: A Grim Reality for U.K. Female Candidates,2019-12-05,By Megan Specia,"['LEEDS, England — The campaign office is deliberately inconspicuous — tucked above a salon through an unmarked doorway in a 1970s-era shopping center. There are no campaign posters in the windows. Two cameras are trained on the entrance. The door frame was recently reinforced. They are necessary precautions, said Rachel Reeves, the Labour candidate who has represented this area of Leeds in Parliament since 2010 and uses the space as both her constituency office and now as her campaign headquarters. The death threats, abuse on social media and graffiti calling for “traitor” lawmakers to be hanged have changed her approach ahead of Britain’s upcoming general election.   This is the new reality, she and other lawmakers say, in a campaign environment that has become remarkably nasty, particularly for women, who face a torrent of abuse and threats often laced with misogyny. And it is happening across the political spectrum. “I do think it’s a very different atmosphere and environment now compared to the first two times I stood,” Ms. Reeves said. “People are a lot angrier and there’s a lot more polarization, particularly around the Brexit issue.” In the dwindling days before Britain heads to the polls, candidates, particularly women, are finding themselves campaigning in a climate where they say abuse, threats and a culture of intimidation have become the norm. With the Labour and Conservative parties hurling blame and allegations of racism and wrongdoing at each other, and anger and exhaustion over the still unresolved issue of Brexit, the country is divided like never before. Where once candidates might have tried to be as visible as possible, many are now proceeding with caution, heeding warnings from the police. The abuse is not directed entirely at women. Men have come in for their share as well.  But a study conducted during the most recent election showed that female lawmakers received disproportionately more abuse on social media, with women of color receiving an even larger share.  And when more than a dozen female lawmakers cited threats and online abuse last month as part of their rationale for not running in the upcoming election, a discomforting spotlight was again thrust on the treatment of women in British politics.  In a system where women are already underrepresented, making up just 32 percent of Parliament, some feared the abuse would drive away potential new candidates. Despite the charged atmosphere heading into the campaign, a record number of women — 1,124 of 3,322 registered candidates — are running in the election,  the BBC reported. But many say they are having to adjust to a new reality where threats and intimidation are the norm. “I think that we are a little bit more reticent in advertising where we are going to be,” Ms. Reeves said, so she instead shares photos of campaign appearances after the fact. It is a precaution the police have suggested since the murder of her close friend Jo Cox, she said.  In Leeds, the 2016 murder of Ms. Cox, a Labour lawmaker who represented the nearby area of Batley and Spen, is never far from people’s minds.  Ms. Cox was shot by a man shouting “Britain first” and “death to traitors” while she campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union ahead of the Brexit referendum. “We really needed to learn the lessons from that, and yet here we are, three and a half years later, and I think the environment is much more toxic,” Ms. Reeves said.  She believes Brexit divisions and language used by leaders in Parliament have fueled the anger. “The language of betrayal, of traitor, of treachery, of surrender,” she said, repeating words that she and many of her female Labour colleagues have criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson  for using against his opponents in the past. But, she said, the misogyny is not limited to one side of the political spectrum.  A man was jailed last month for sending a threatening letter to Anna Soubry, a onetime Conservative who now heads an upstart party, Change UK. Two Labour activists were injured in separate attacks last week while canvassing door to door. Six people have been convicted recently of criminal offenses for abuse and threats directed at Luciana Berger, a former Labour lawmaker and now Liberal Democrat candidate. Both the far right and far left went after her for her Jewish religion or her stance on Brexit. Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative lawmaker who is running to retain her seat in the constituency of Morley and Outwood, five miles south of Ms. Reeves’s area in Leeds, detailed a barrage of abuse after she won her district in the 2015 election, ending an 85-year reign by Labour.  Ms. Jenkyns — ardently pro-Brexit and an outspoken supporter of Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal deal — has received emails at her office threatening sexual violence, and detractors on social media have called her a bad mother.  Six weeks ago, her staff arrived at their office on Morley’s main street to find graffiti scrawled in the entryway: “Andrea just kill yourself pls.” Many of her campaign signs, which depict a smiling Ms. Jenkyns standing alongside Mr. Johnson, have been defaced. In one, a hole was punched through her face. Ms. Jenkyns believes the current climate is a departure from the “grown-up politics” of her first two campaigns, and she blames the heightened tensions on Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, for driving that party further to the left. But, she conceded, Brexit has also played a role.  “The sad thing is, you deal with it on a daily basis so you are probably not shocked anymore and you accept it,” Ms. Jenkyns said. “And what kind of society is that?” For the first time, Britain’s National Police Chiefs’ Council, which coordinates law enforcement across the country, and the Electoral Commission have issued a nationwide set of safety guidelines for candidates and activists. It advises canvassing in groups and encourages candidates and their supporters to report threats, including those made online. The decision to hold an election in December, when daylight is in short supply across Britain, has also forced many candidates to rethink their strategies, with some, including Ms. Jenkyns, swearing off knocking on doors in the dark because of safety concerns. Before previous elections, much of Ms. Reeves’s canvassing would take place after the workday ended. Now, it’s dark by 4:30 p.m. On Tuesday, she set out at 4 p.m., knocking on doors with a small team of volunteers who put leaflets through mail slots in the Fairfield Estate, a mixture of public housing projects and privately owned homes spread out over a steep hillside. The streetlights came on as she made her way along the densely packed terraced houses, her red Labour candidate badge visible in the darkness. Few answered the door. But those who happened to be home were mostly positive, mixed with a few curt responses from those not supporting Labour.  “I think we are certainly a little more vigilant,” Ms. Reeves said, describing a few confrontations. “We would never have someone go door-knocking by themselves.” Ms. Cox’s younger sister, Kim Leadbetter, believes that the conversation around Brexit has grown increasingly vitriolic in the years since her sister’s death. She worries it could prove damaging to the democratic process and discourage young people, particularly women, from politics.  “When Jo was murdered, there was a short period of time when politicians said all the right things about how politics needed to take a step back,” she said.  But it didn’t last. Instead, she said, anger, frustration, and violent language seem to dominate the conversation. Ms. Leadbetter, an ambassador for the Jo Cox Foundation, a nonpartisan, community-building charity that was created after her sister’s death, said that while her sister was an advocate of robust debate, “we have to be able to disagree agreeably.” While there is undoubtedly an issue with threats of violence on social media — due in part to the anonymity the platforms can provide — Ms. Leadbetter warned against dismissing them as just an online problem.  “It only takes one individual who cannot see the difference between violent, aggressive and abusive language and an act of violence that can change people’s lives forever,” she said.']",This is politics in a climate of fear and intimidation: Inconspicuous offices with no campaign posters and multiple security cameras.

‘He Showed Us Life’: Japanese Doctor Who Brought Water to Afghans Is Killed,2019-12-04,"By Zabihullah Ghazi, Mujib Mashal and Fahim Abed","['JALALABAD, Afghanistan — The people he helped called him “Uncle Murad.” Dr. Tetsu Nakamura left his home in Japan in the 1980s to treat leprosy patients in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He later found, however, that severe drought was killing more people than his clinics could save. So he discovered a new calling: irrigation. In the 2000s, adapting old Japanese techniques that required little technology, he helped villagers displaced by drought build a network of canals that has transformed an area of nearly a million residents.  “A doctor treats patients one by one, but this helps a whole village,” Dr. Nakamura had said. “I love seeing a village that’s been brought back to life.” On Wednesday, Dr. Nakamura was attacked by gunmen while driving to work in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar Province, in eastern Afghanistan. Five members of his organization’s staff were killed, and Dr. Nakamura was wounded fatally. He was 73. “He was operated on in Nangarhar hospital, but he had received several bullet wounds,” said Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the province’s governor. Dr. Nakamura died as they were rushing him to the local airport to fly him to the medical facility at the American military base in Bagram, Mr. Khogyani said. It was the latest case in a series of attacks targeted at humanitarian workers in Afghanistan, just a week after an American working for the United Nations was killed in an explosion striking his vehicle in the capital, Kabul. Dr. Nakamura’s murder was particularly brutal, sending shocks of grief around Afghanistan and drawing widespread condemnation. No militant group has yet claimed responsibility: The Taliban denied involvement, said a Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid. The killing came on a day the State Department announced its peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, was on the road again after President Trump declared the resumption of talks with the Taliban, which he had called off in September. After meeting Afghan leaders in Kabul, Mr. Khalilzad was set to travel to the Qatari capital, Doha, to resume negotiations with the Taliban. “In Doha, Ambassador Khalilzad will rejoin talks with the Taliban to discuss steps that could lead to intra-Afghan negotiations and a peaceful settlement of the war, specifically a reduction in violence that leads to a cease fire,” the State Department said in a statement. The sorrow for Dr. Nakamura was deep in Khewa, a district in Nangarhar where much of the work of his organization, Peace Japan Medical Services, had been focused. “He showed us life — he helped build our land. He was a leader to us,” said Hamidullah Hashemi, a resident of Khewa. “I feel like they have killed my closest family member. They left us without Nakamura.” President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, who in October awarded Dr. Nakamura honorary citizenship for his services, expressed “utmost grief and sorrow” and ordered his security agencies to find the perpetrators.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan highlighted the transformative work Dr. Nakamura had done. “I was shocked that he had to die this way,” Mr. Abe told reporters. Dr. Nakamura was among a handful of aid workers in Afghanistan who could trace a continual connection to the country from its descent into chaos in the 1980s through the decades of war and turmoil that have followed.  He was born in Japan’s Fukuoka Prefecture in 1946, and his first exposure to eastern Afghanistan was in his early 30s. According to a biography published by the Ramon Magsaysay Award, a prize for “greatness of spirit and transformative leadership in Asia” that he received in 2003, he was initially drawn to the mountainous borderland between Afghanistan and Pakistan by a fascination with insects. He quickly found himself besieged with requests for medical help. After finishing medical school, Dr. Nakamura returned to the Pakistani border city of Peshawar, establishing clinics to treat the locals and Afghan refugees fleeing the Soviet war. He then opened clinics in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, just as a severe drought was affecting the region. His patients were not only suffering from malnourishment but also diarrhea, as sources of clean water were scarce.  Dr. Nakamura, who also learned to speak the local language, Pashto, initially tried to improve the situation by digging hundreds of wells for clean water, but soon realized that wasn’t the answer. “Starvation, drought — medicine can’t solve these problems,” Dr. Nakamura told the Japanese channel NHK in what was likely one of his last interviews. “We realized we needed to go beyond the narrow field of medicine and work to ensure that people had enough food and water.” So he turned to building canals from existing water sources to irrigate arid regions. After facing difficulties in procuring equipment to dig the first canals, he drew inspiration from those built more than 200 years ago in his hometown in Japan.  Back then, Dr. Nakamura said, “You didn’t have dump-trucks and things like that. The villagers had to all work together to construct it by hand. So there was no reason why people living today couldn’t do the same thing. The thought inspired me. If we tried, we could do it.” Over six years, with a work force drawn from drought-stricken villages, Dr. Nakamura helped build a main canal about 15 miles long. He continued the work even after militants abducted and killed one of his colleagues, Kazuya Ito. The smaller canals his team built spread across four districts. All in all, the Afghan authorities in Nangarhar said, by the time of his murder his canals had improved the livelihood of nearly a million people, and irrigated nearly 60,000 acres of previously arid land. “He loved Afghanistan,” said Malek Zahoor, a local elder in Khewa district. “He had left his own home to be here, to help people here.” Zabihullah Ghazi reported from Jalalabad, and Mujib Mashal and Fahim Abed from Kabul, Afghanistan.']","Tetsu Nakamura, 73, arrived in Afghanistan in the 1980s to treat leprosy. But he changed many more lives with the canal-building techniques he brought from his native Japan. "
"Ukraine Knew of Aid Freeze in July, Says Ex-Top Official in Kyiv",2019-12-03,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['KYIV, Ukraine — As deputy foreign minister, it was Olena Zerkal’s job to read incoming diplomatic cables from embassies around the world. One from Washington caught her eye back in July, she recalled: It said the Trump administration had frozen military aid for Ukraine. “We had this information,” Ms. Zerkal said in an interview. “It was definitely mentioned there were some issues.” The timing of when Ukraine knew of the hold on the military aid is a critical question in the impeachment hearings in Congress. Democrats are trying to build a case that President Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky by withholding the aid and a White House meeting — at the same time he was pressing for a public announcement that Ukraine would investigate his political rivals. Mr. Trump and his allies have also made the timing issue part of his defense. How could Ukrainian officials feel the pressure of the aid freeze, they ask, if they did not know about it when the White House was pushing them to investigate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of Mr. Trump’s biggest challengers in the 2020 American presidential election?  “They didn’t even know the money wasn’t paid,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last month. Ms. Zerkal’s account is the first public acknowledgment by a Ukrainian official that senior figures in Kyiv knew about the aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and that the Zelensky administration sought to keep that fact from surfacing to avoid getting drawn into the American impeachment debate.  She said her own government blocked a trip she had planned to Washington to meet members of Congress in October, worried she would discuss matters related to impeachment and drag its president into an inquiry he has been eager to avoid. “They worried about this,” she said of Mr. Zelensky’s advisers. “They said, ‘This is not the time for you to travel to D.C.’” The cancellation of her trip was confirmed by Congressional aides. Mr. Zelensky, whose government is still dependent on the Trump administration for aid and diplomatic backing, has said he did not learn of the aid freeze until before a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence on Sept. 1, though he has been vague about exactly when.  But according to testimony in the impeachment inquiry, Ukrainian diplomats in Washington knew there was a problem with the aid as early as July 25, the day Mr. Trump spoke with the Ukrainian president by phone and asked him to investigate his rivals.  In the interview, Ms. Zerkal, who said she resigned from her post last week to protest her government’s back channel diplomacy with both the Trump administration last summer and Russia this fall, provided an insider’s account of when senior officials in Kyiv learned of the freeze, and how they tried to keep the information from becoming public. Her account is backed by Laura K. Cooper, the American deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, who said in Congressional testimony during the impeachment inquiry that Ukrainian diplomats knew about the aid freeze at least by July 25, when they began to question United States officials about it.  That was the same day Mr. Trump spoke by phone with Mr. Zelensky and asked the Ukrainian leader to do him the “favor” of investigating the activities of Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked into Democratic servers during the 2016 presidential election.  Ms. Zerkal says she became aware of the hold by July 30, a few days after Mr. Trump’s phone call with Mr. Zelensky. She said she read a diplomatic cable from Ukrainian officials in Washington about the hold and asked for a meeting with a senior aide to Mr. Zelensky to discuss it on July 30. The cable had been sent the previous week, she said, but she could not confirm the precise date it had been transmitted. The Ukrainian presidential administration was copied as a recipient of the cable from the embassy in Washington, she said, adding: “We received it simultaneously.”  Whether senior Ukrainian officials knew of the aid freeze before the July 25 phone call or not, the accounts of Ms. Zerkal and Ms. Cooper show that the Ukrainian government was aware of the hold on aid through several critical weeks in August as United States diplomats pressed Mr. Zelensky to make a public statement on the investigations. Later, as the impeachment inquiry ramped up in the United States, Mr. Zelensky’s administration tried to squelch information that could embarrass or undercut Mr. Trump, Ms. Zerkal said.  At a meeting in September, Ms. Zerkal said, a senior aide to Mr. Zelensky told her to “keep silent” and avoid news media inquires on any topic.  The foreign minister appointed by Mr. Zelensky, Vadym Prystaiko, later blocked a planned visit to Washington by Ms. Zerkal in October, she said. His concern, she said, was that she would discuss information relevant to the impeachment proceedings — like when Ukraine learned military aid had been put on hold — with members of Congress. Ms. Zerkal says she had arranged meetings with politicians from both parties, including Democratic Senators Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Chuck Schumer of New York, and Republican Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as with staff members of Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The stated purpose of the meetings was to discuss American sanctions on Russia, but questions of when Ukraine became aware of the freeze on American aid could have come up.  “His main message to me was to keep silent, to not comment without permission,” Ms. Zerkal said of the aide to Mr. Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, who asked that she keep a low profile on all matters, not just those related to the United States. “They are in a very tricky situation and they understand this.” Mr. Zelensky’s press office did not respond to questions about Ms. Zerkal’s account of how the government learned of the aid freeze or the reasons for canceling her trip to meet with members of Congress.  But Mr. Zelensky has insisted he wants to steer clear of the impeachment process and has signaled a desire for good relations with the Trump administration. Speaking in New York in September, he said he had not been pressured by Mr. Trump. Later, at a news conference in October, Mr. Zelensky said he was not aware, at the time of his phone call with Mr. Trump on July 25, that military aid was frozen. On Saturday, he told journalists from Time magazine and three European publications, “look, I never talked to the president from the position of quid pro quo.”  But he also had pointed comments on the hold on aid. “We’re at war,” he said. “If you’re our strategic partner, then you can’t go blocking anything for us. I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about quid pro quo.” Ms. Zerkal’s account demonstrates just how hard, bordering on impossible, it is for Mr. Zelensky to avoid taking sides in the impeachment inquiry. If he is misleading people about his knowledge of the aid freeze, then he is damaging the Democrats’ case against Mr. Trump. If he admits knowing, he damages Mr. Trump’s case. The Zelensky administration, Ms. Zerkal said, is most concerned about placating Mr. Trump, having decided that the impeachment inquiry will fail in the Senate and that Mr. Trump could be re-elected. Indications had already been stacking up that Ukrainian officials knew well before the hold became public in August, first in a blog posted by the Atlantic Council on Aug. 14 and then in an article published by Politico on Aug. 28. An associate of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, Lev Parnas, has said he warned of a possible aid freeze as early as May, though others who attended the same meeting have contested his account.  Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine specialist in the National Security Council, testified that he learned of a hold in early July. More United States officials became aware during a conference call on July 18, and the Office of Management and Budget put the hold in writing on July 25, shortly after Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Zelensky. Ms. Zerkal said she was alarmed to read of the freeze in late July. Ukraine is at war with Russian-backed separatists in two eastern provinces and considers the United States an ally.  “This information caught my attention,” she said. “Without your clear support and stance against Russian aggression we won’t be able, alone, to protect ourselves.” Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting from Washington.']","Ukraine’s government learned of the military aid freeze during the Trump administration’s pressure campaign — and tried to keep that knowledge from going public, an ex-deputy foreign minister said.

"Election Fraud Aided Evo Morales, International Panel Concludes",2019-12-05,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['An independent international audit of Bolivia’s disputed election concluded that former President Evo Morales’s officials resorted to lies, manipulation and forgery to ensure his victory. Bolivia’s general elections on Oct. 20 were marred by “a series of malicious operations aimed at altering the will expressed at the polls,” auditors from the Organization of American States said in a 100-page final report released Thursday. Deliberate wrongdoing by election officials, combined with a series of errors and irregularities in the vote count, made it impossible to validate the results, the auditors added. The election’s initial official results handed Mr. Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, an unprecedented fourth term in office, defying the constitutional term limits he himself had set. An unexplained delay in the vote count, however, triggered a wave of protests across Bolivia’s major cities, which eventually forced Mr. Morales to resign and flee into exile in Mexico. Mr. Morales himself agreed to the international report. His government called on the O.A.S. to conduct a “binding” audit of the vote in an attempt to quell the unrest triggered by his victory. Mr. Morales’s party has since voted to annul the elections and hold a new vote; Mr. Morales is banned from running in the new election. A caretaker government arrested Bolivia’s top election officials on accusations of fraud and moved to elect a new electoral board. The election ban marked a definitive end to Mr. Morales’s transformative 14 years in office, during which he lifted millions of Bolivians out of poverty, made major advances in civil rights and diversified the economy. Mr. Morales’s economic and political successes, however, bred increasingly authoritarian tendencies that eventually led to his downfall. After declaring victory despite accusations of fraud, Mr. Morales failed to reestablish control of the mutinous cities. The final push came on Nov. 10, when the military asked Mr. Morales to resign to restore national peace. He left for exile the next day. Mr. Morales was replaced by a conservative interim government, which moved to suppress his supporters and prosecute his officials. More than 30 people died in the unrest following the Oct. 20 vote, most of them Mr. Morales’s supporters who protested his ouster. The report by the O.A.S.’s 36 auditors accused Bolivia’s election officials of setting up a “parallel technological scheme” of hidden servers, which permitted the alteration of results and forging of signatures of electoral observers. The protests were triggered by the electoral board’s decision to stop counting votes when it appeared that Mr. Morales didn’t have a large enough margin of victory to avoid a runoff. When the final count resumed a day later, the remaining votes overwhelmingly went to Mr. Morales, allowing him to clinch the victory. The O.A.S. auditors said the sudden halt in the transmission of results was “intentional, arbitrary and without technical basis.” In their initial statements and a preliminary audit following the election, the O.A.S. officials called the sudden change in the voting trend “statistically unlikely.” The comments triggered criticism from some economists and statisticians in the United States, who argued that the change could be explained by strong support for Mr. Morales in the outstanding precincts. Those critics, however, have not addressed the accusations of hidden data servers, forged signatures and other irregularities found by the O.A.S. observers, nor have they tried to explain the electoral council’s sudden decision to stop the count.']",Charges of voting fraud that led to protests and the exile of President Evo Morales have been confirmed in a final report by the Organization of American States. 
North Korea Threatens New ‘Dotard’ Insults if Trump Revives Name-Calling,2019-12-05,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Thursday threatened to resume calling President Trump bad names, including a “dotard,” two days after he again called its leader “Rocket Man” and raised the possibility of using military force. North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, said that if Mr. Trump deliberately stoked “the atmosphere of confrontation” once again, then that “must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.”  Ms. Choe issued her statement, which was carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, in response to remarks Mr. Trump made in London on Tuesday, on the sidelines of his meetings with NATO leaders.  “We’re by far the most powerful country in the world,” Mr. Trump said, urging North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to honor his promise to denuclearize. “And, hopefully, we don’t have to use it, but if we do, we’ll use it.” Although he said he still had “a good relationship” and “confidence” in Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump also \u200bemployed the mocking nickname he had used against the North Korean leader when he and Mr. K\u200bim traded threats of war and personal insults two years ago. “He definitely likes sending rockets up, doesn’t he?” Mr. Trump said, referring to the \u200brecent \u200bseries of short-range ballistic and rocket tests\u200b by North Korea\u200b. “That’s why I call him ‘Rocket Man.’” On Wednesday, the North Korean military vowed to retaliate if the United States used military force. But on Thursday, Ms. Choe said her government was more upset by Mr. Trump’s name-calling against its leader than his threat to use military force. She warned that \u200bNorth Korea could resume a war of insults against Mr. Trump. “If Trump’s remarks on use of force and metaphor were a mistake, it would be a relief, but if they were a calculated provocation intended against us, that makes things different,” Ms. Choe said. In his United Nations speech in September 2017, Mr. Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea and famously called Mr. Kim a “Rocket Man” on “a suicide mission\u200b.” Mr. Trump issued his 2017 threat after North Korea flight-tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles and detonat\u200bed what it called a hydrogen bomb in its sixth and most powerful underground nuclear test. Mr. Kim delivered an equally famous rejoinder. “A frightened dog barks louder,” Mr. Kim said, referring to Mr. Trump. “I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.” Two months later, North Korea launched its most powerful international ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15, which demonstrated the potential to reach the mainland United States.  In a dramatic shift, \u200bhowever, \u200bMr. Kim and Mr. Trump started engaging in diplomacy in 2018, with Mr. Trump going so far as to say that he and Mr. Kim “fell in love.” In June 2018, they held their first summit meeting in Singapore, during which Mr. Kim promised to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” in return for “new” relations and security guarantees from Washington. But subsequent negotiations have stalled over how to implement the broadly worded agreement, and North Korea has sounded increasingly frustrated about negotiating with Washington in recent months.  It has resumed short-range missile tests this year, warning that it would formally end diplomacy unless Washington made more concessions by the end of December.']","North Korea threatened to resume tit-for-tat insults against President Trump two days after he called its leader, Kim Jong-un, a “Rocket Man.”"
How Charlottesville’s Echoes Forced New Zealand to Confront Its History,2019-12-03,By Jamie Tarabay,"['HAMILTON, New Zealand — An 80-year-old Maori man walked up to a statue of a colonial-era British naval commander one winter morning in 2018, a can of paint and a claw hammer in his hands.  “The red paint was to change the way he looked, and the hammer was to break his nose,” said the man, Taitimu Maipi.  Mr. Maipi’s small act of vandalism in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, was intended to be a reminder of the pain that white settlers inflicted on the Indigenous Maori people. It ended up forcing a national reckoning over historical memory and cultural identity that paralleled in many ways the upheaval a year before in Charlottesville, Va.  The attack in Hamilton drew extensive coverage in the local newspaper. Residents responded with letters denouncing the vandalism. And the conversation caught the eye of one longtime reader: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.  In September, Ms. Ardern announced that the national school curriculum would be changed to require lessons on the 19th-century New Zealand Land Wars, in which British troops killed more than 2,000 Maori. “I did not see that coming,” Mr. Maipi, a longtime activist, said recently as he stood beside the bronze statue of Capt. John Hamilton, which remains in the middle of Hamilton’s downtown square. In a different time, the seemingly minor gesture of protest — after the attack, Mr. Maipi stopped by City Hall to leave his contact information and later got off with a police warning — might have been quickly forgotten. But his defiant action came not long after the deadly white supremacist violence in Charlottesville over the planned removal of a Confederate statue.  “I think it’s all connected,” said Aaron Leaman, a reporter for The Waikato Times, which published a series of articles as part of a campaign to bring more of New Zealand’s history into its schools. “I don’t think what happened here could be seen in isolation.”  After Mr. Maipi’s vandalism, some New Zealanders called for the statue’s removal because of the role of Captain Hamilton — for whom the city is named, though he never set foot there — in the deaths of Maori during the Land Wars, which raged from 1845 to 1872.  Those bloody conflicts broke out after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 between the colonial government and the Maori. Disputes over land sales grew into major campaigns to confiscate territory and reinforce British sovereignty.  Community upheaval followed these assaults against the Maori, and more than 100 years later, they still lag on many social measures like income and life expectancy, though the government has worked to close the gap. New Zealand is still  paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement claims related to the treaty. “I just wanted to expose the fact that this statue shouldn’t be here,” Mr. Maipi said. “I wanted to break something,” he added. “I really meant what I did.” Captain Hamilton, he said, “was a murderer.”  “There’s a lot of pain there for people who were part of those wars,” he added. Other citizens — many of them older, white residents who wrote letters to the editor — complained about the damage to public property and argued that removing the statue would be akin to erasing history. Some used racist language.  “A lot of people were saying this is terrible, destroying public property, and we were saying, come on people, there’s a lot of history behind this, and there aren’t a lot of Maori statues or any kind of acknowledgment of their role,” said Jonathan MacKenzie, the editor in chief of The Waikato Times. “Clearly, the people reading had little understanding of the country’s past, and what they knew was based on the wrong information,” Mr. MacKenzie added. While some of the bigoted statements might have been ignored in the past, said Mr. Leaman, the reporter, such views now command greater attention after the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch.  “It’s easy to brush them off as fringe,” he said, “but after Christchurch, we take hate speech more seriously.” The newsroom decided to work to educate its readership, Mr. MacKenzie said. “We thought, why don’t we do some stories on people who fought on the Maori side of the war; they’d be passed down orally,” he said.  The effort would build on a push by two nearby schools to make teaching of the Land Wars compulsory. Currently, New Zealand history is an elective in school, and the Land Wars aren’t part of the curriculum at all.  “We thought we could really put some pressure on and act as a bit of an amplifier,” Mr. MacKenzie said.  The journalists didn’t imagine that the stories would get much notice. But they hadn’t anticipated the attention of a prime minister who keeps an eye on the city of her birth. The Waikato Times’s campaign “stood out to me because I know the region well and because it’s a view I’ve held for some time,” Ms. Ardern said in an email to The New York Times. She announced two months ago that changes to the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools would be made within the next three years. Ms. Ardern said the public reaction had been “incredible and far-reaching. I think a lot of that stems from a desire from New Zealanders to know more about their own country’s history, our land and our people.”  Mr. Maipi said that New Zealanders had been better at commemorating foreign wars, like World War I, than they had been at acknowledging local history, because of the cost to the Maori. “We need to educate the country that this happened; we need to educate our children,” he said. He added: “The story will be told by the children. Unless you tell the children, it will die.” The newly elected mayor of Hamilton, Paula Southgate, is waiting on a report that will assess the street names and statues throughout the city that might be culturally offensive to the Maori. She expects it to recommend moving the statue of Captain Hamilton. “If there’s something that’s blatantly culturally insensitive, you need to address it and be respectful about that,” she said.']","A Maori man attacked a statue to raise awareness of his ancestors’ pain.

Germany Says Russia Is Suspected in Berlin Assassination,2019-12-04,By Melissa Eddy and Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — The German authorities declared on Wednesday that Russia was suspected of being behind the daylight assassination in Berlin this summer of a former fighter with Chechen separatists. Berlin also expelled two Russian diplomats, adding new strains to relations with Moscow. The announcement deepened concerns about Russian contract killings in Europe, after last year’s nerve agent poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian spy who was living in Britain. Western countries responded to that by expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats from their countries, and German lawmakers called for a similar joint European response to the killing in Berlin.  Peter Frank, Germany’s federal prosecutor, said his office would take over the case, identifying the suspect, who is believed to be a Russian contract killer, only as Vadim K., in keeping with German privacy laws. The Dossier Center, a London-based research group founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a Russian former oil billionaire, and other investigation groups had previously identified the suspect as Vadim N. Krasikov. The Dossier Center shared with the German authorities what it described as compelling evidence linking the killing to the Russian government, a spokesman said last month. Many of the details cited by the federal prosecutor on Wednesday checked against those previously released by the center. The German authorities had struggled to identify the suspect since he was taken into police custody in August, after witnesses said they had seen him ride a bicycle up to the victim and shoot him once in the torso and twice in the head before fleeing the scene. Although the authorities  considered Russian involvement virtually from the start, it was only in recent weeks that sufficient evidence was gathered to back those suspicions, Mr. Frank said in a statement.  The additional evidence elevated the killing of the former fighter, a Russian-Georgian citizen identified by prosecutors only as Tornike K., from a simple murder case to a state security threat.  “There are sufficient, real indications that the killing of Tornike K. was carried out either on orders by the officials in the Russian Federation or those in the autonomous Chechen Republic, as part of the Russian Republic,” Mr. Frank’s office said in a statement. The victim was previously identified by the German authorities by an alias, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former commander of a Chechen separatist force whom the Russian state news media has depicted as a terrorist. The prosecutor cited photographs of the suspect that matched images of a Vadim K. who had been sought by the Russian authorities for a 2013 murder in Moscow that was also carried out by an assassin on a bicycle. The Russian authorities later withdrew the warrant, although the investigation remained open, German prosecutors said. Immediately after the announcement, the Foreign Ministry in Berlin ordered two diplomats stationed at the Russian Embassy expelled, citing Moscow’s unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation.  The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that Russia would take “a little time” to work out its countermeasures, the news agency Interfax reported.  Maria V. Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, denounced what she called Germany’s “politicized approach” to the murder investigation. “We view the German claims regarding the expulsion of two employees of the Russian Embassy in Berlin to be groundless and unfriendly,” Ms. Zakharova said, according to Russian news agencies. “We will be forced to implement a set of measures in response.” The German authorities’ frustration with their Russian counterparts built over three months as investigators in Berlin investigated the case but received no help from Moscow in identifying the man in their custody.  Eventually, the office of Chancellor Angela Merkel became involved and a complaint was made to the Kremlin about the lack of cooperation. On Wednesday, Ms. Merkel defended the decision to expel the Russian diplomats as a consequence of the inaction. “We took this step because we did not see that Russia was supporting our investigation of this murder,” she told reporters in Watford, England, where Western leaders are gathered to celebrate NATO’s 70th anniversary.  According to the prosecutor, the suspect was carrying a Russian passport when arrested on Aug. 23 that the Russian authorities confirmed as authentic. Although the document identified him as Vadim Andreevich Sokolov, investigators said at the time that they believed the name was fake. The suspect had arrived in Europe on a flight from Moscow to Paris and entered on a visa previously issued by French authorities that allowed him to work and move freely throughout the European Union, the prosecutor added. Three days later, he continued to Warsaw, where he checked into a hotel for a five-night stay. After only three nights, however, he left and did not return. The following day he was arrested in Berlin. The man’s visa said he had been employed as an engineer since 2017 at a company called Zao Rust, based in St. Petersburg. But according to records in Russia, the company was in “reorganization” in 2019 and had only one employee in 2018, according to the prosecutor. When the German authorities tried to contact the company, they discovered that the fax number listed for it was the same as that of two other companies, both belonging to the Russian Defense Ministry, the prosecutor said.  Mr. Khodorkovsky, the founder of the Dossier Center, said in an interview that, “The Kremlin is no longer ashamed of reasonable suspicions that it carries out murders in Western Europe.” “No democracy can allow this,” he added, warning that “indulging” Russia would not pay off in the long term. Many German lawmakers have said that they believe the evidence implicating Russia from the Dossier Center — as well as from the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and from Bellingcat, an investigative group — is strong enough to merit the case being treated as a matter of state security.  “The federal prosecutor taking over is a good sign that should have come weeks ago,” said Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker for the opposition Greens and deputy leader of the parliamentary committee that oversees the country’s intelligence services. Roderich Kiesewetter, a foreign affairs expert for Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, said the new evidence justified sanctions against Moscow.  “Russia has repeatedly ignored Germany’s request, as a partner, for an explanation and to help identify the suspected perpetrator,” Mr. Kiesewetter said.   “The evidence we have now points to the involvement of a Russian state actor,’’ he added. “Therefore, it is correct to respond to the lack of cooperation with diplomatic sanctions to make clear our intention for a swift clarification.” The one compelling lead the Germans had early on — a mysterious email sent shortly after the shooting that identified the killer as a former St. Petersburg police officer imprisoned for murder — turned out to be a dead end. The German authorities now believe that the officer in question, who was first publicly identified by The New York Times, remains in a Russian prison, 1,500 miles from Berlin.  In a letter sent to The Times, someone claiming to be the St. Petersburg police officer, Vladimir Stepanov, denied that he had anything to do with the killing in Berlin and insisted he was still in prison.  The return address was IK-11, a penal colony in the Russian town of Bor that is said to be reserved for former law enforcement and intelligence officers convicted of serious crimes.  A stamp indicated the letter had been inspected by the prison authorities. Other countries are watching the Berlin investigation closely. “We find it sad that a Georgian citizen was killed in the middle of the day in central Berlin and so many questions remain open,” said Elguja Khokrishvili, the Georgian ambassador to Germany. “We hope that the German authorities will pursue this case until we know the truth.” Anton Troianovski contributed reporting from Moscow.']","Germany’s federal prosecutor took over an inquiry into the murder of a former commander of Chechen separatists, and the authorities expelled two Russian diplomats.

A Divorced Mother Sues After Losing Her Title as Miss Ukraine,2019-12-04,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — For four days in 2018, Veronika Didusenko was hailed as Ukraine’s most beautiful woman. But it wasn’t quite as simple as that. When the organizers of the Miss Ukraine competition found out that she was divorced and had a son, they stripped her of the title — and the $12,000 prize money — saying she had broken the rules. Now Ms. Didusenko, 24, is suing the Miss World organization, with which the Ukrainian competition is affiliated, saying that the entry requirements — including that contestants be unmarried and childless — are a form of discrimination.  Ms. Didusenko announced the legal action in an Instagram post this week, writing that the entry policy operated by Miss World was “discriminatory on various grounds, namely marital status, and pregnancy and maternity.” In the post, she added that she only wanted to change the rules, not to have her Miss Ukraine crown back. Miss World said in a statement on Wednesday that Ms. Didusenko had been disqualified because she “gave false information on her application.” Ms. Didusenko acknowledged in a private Instagram message on Wednesday that she did not disclose the fact that she was a mother when she entered the competition in Ukraine. But she denied that she had lied, saying that she was single at the time and that there had been no option on the online application form to disclose that she was divorced and had a son.  The website does list the requirements, including not only the rules about marital status and childlessness, but also restrictions on age and height, and a need to have “no bad habits.”  Ms. Didusenko said that she had entered the contest to promote a charity that she had been working for that helped orphans. She said that she never thought she would win and was shocked when she was awarded the title in September 2018. The victory lasted just four days. When the organizers of Miss Ukraine heard that she was a mother, they called Ms. Didusenko for confirmation. “Of course, I said yes,” said Ms. Didusenko, whose son is now 5. In an emailed statement on Wednesday, Yuri Ageiev, the head of the Miss Ukraine committee, said Ms. Didusenko had agreed to the rules. He said the hectic schedule of the winner was unsuitable for women with children because it “may negatively affect the upbringing of a small child who will be deprived of his mother’s love.” Miss World America also requires participants to be unmarried and childless. Miss World said in its statement on Ms. Didusenko that the rules were set with the aim of finding a winner “who is free and able to commit, often at short notice, to travel globally in support of the sick and disadvantaged which may be for long periods of time, often to areas devastated by natural disasters.”  Ms. Didusenko said those arguments were unconvincing. “Imagine you are Serena Williams going to play in Wimbledon when suddenly you realize that the entry criteria bans moms from taking part in the games,” she said. “Sounds shocking.” Marichka Varenikova contributed reporting from Kalmar, Sweden. ']",Veronika Didusenko accused the Miss World organization of discrimination after being forced to give up her crown because she did not meet the entry requirements.
‘A Present From Norway and It’s Dead’: Christmas Tree Unites London in Dismay,2019-12-05,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — For some people, Christmas is all about carols, presents, Santa Claus and his reindeer. Not for Trevor Smith, for whom the highlight of the festive season is a tall, woody perennial fir that is dispatched every year from Norway to Britain: the Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square. This year, however, the tree is not a sight for sore eyes. Just two years after Romans mocked their Christmas tree, nicknaming it Spelacchio — Mangy — it’s now Londoners’ turn to unite in their shared disappointment in the sparse spruce.  “I come every year, and this one is quite bare,” Mr. Smith, 73, said on Thursday, gazing at the thin, 79-foot tree standing at the foot of the National Gallery in Central London.  Like a child excitedly unwrapping presents on Christmas morning, Mr. Smith travels every year from his house near Heathrow International Airport to Trafalgar Square after the tree is erected just to get a glimpse.  “It’s absolutely a happy day,” he said, but added that this year’s tree “just looks a bit sad.” Maybe the sea journey from Norway to Britain was too rough this year, he suggested, or climate change could be to blame. “It’s probably a bit short of water; I think it needs a drink,” said another passer-by, Mark Wansborough-Jones, also 73. The tree is an annual gift from the people of Oslo to London as a sign of gratitude for Britain’s help during World War II, the Westminster City Council said in an emailed statement. The tradition started in 1947, when King Haakon VII, who ruled Norway for 52 years, sent a tree as a thank-you gift to Britain, where he had escaped to after the Nazis invaded Norway. Year in and year out, the fir’s sole decorations are strings of white Christmas lights, in accordance with the traditional Norwegian style, the council said. The lighting ceremony in London was to take place early Thursday evening. “It is one of the highlights for every Lord Mayor to take part in this great festive event celebrating the enduring friendship between our nations,” Councilor Ruth Bush, the Lord Mayor of Westminster, said in a statement. But the frail appearance of this year’s tree has dimmed the excitement for some ahead of the event.  Daniel Freduah-Gyimah, 27, who works at Heavens Grill, a Christmas market stall in front of the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, said on Thursday that while the tree’s height was impressive, “It looks like a Christmas tree losing hair.”  Rory Loregnerd, his 58-year-old colleague, had a harsher assessment. “It’s dead,” he said, adding, “It’s a present from Norway, and it’s dead.”  He even suggested that the Norwegians probably sent this tree as a message against Brexit, despite Norway’s not being part of the European Union. Like all other Christmas trees that end up in Trafalgar Square, this fir was grown in Ostmarka, a forested area east of Oslo, where people talk to and hug trees to encourage their growth, the council said.  In a foreboding twist, the 90-year-old tree was planted close to a small lake named Trollvann, or “the water of the trolls,” according to the council.  As the ridicule against the tree piled up on social media, a Trafalgar Square Tree account on Twitter fired off ripostes.  After a social media user on Monday called the fir the “most anemic tree possible,” the account replied, “I thought I’d left the trolls behind in Norway!”  As for the numerous social media users who called it “dead” or joked that “government cuts” were to blame for the sparse Christmas tree, the account replied, “At 80ft tall the tree will not look like the one in your living room.”  “Out of the ones we’ve seen, it’s not quite as impressive,” Kate Wynn, 36, an engineer who went to see the tree with her young daughter, said on Thursday in Trafalgar Square.  But not everyone hated the tree.  “It’s amazing!” her 6-year-old daughter, Imogen, exclaimed. “It’s huge,” the girl added. “It looks like it’s a million years old.”']","“It looks like a Christmas tree losing hair,” one Londoner said of the fir in Trafalgar Square.

From Friends to Frenemies? Trump’s Relationships With World Leaders,2019-12-03,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — Their bromance once made headlines. But on Tuesday, it was clear that the days of President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France trading cheek kisses and clasping hands were gone. On the sidelines of a gathering for the 70th anniversary of NATO, Mr. Trump took his one-time friend to task, denouncing comments Mr. Macron made last month criticizing the American president’s leadership of NATO, and calling into question several of the French leader’s policies.  Mr. Trump is known for trying to build personal relationships with his counterparts, but he also has a penchant for public feuds, fueled in part by his off-the-cuff approach to the news media and his regular Twitter rants.  And Mr. Macron is just one of a handful of one-time buddies whose initial coziness with Mr. Trump has turned cold.  The budding friendship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron was on full display in the summer of 2017, when the American president first traveled to France.  Mr. Macron pulled out all the stops: a military parade, dinner at the Eiffel Tower and lots of hand holding. Despite their differences on a number of issues, the pair poured on the charm.  During a later visit by Mr. Macron to the White House in April 2018, they kissed each other’s cheeks in a greeting, and at one point, Mr. Trump gently brushed what he said was dandruff from Mr. Macron’s shoulder.  They lavished praise on each other, and played down their disparate approaches to trade, immigration and climate change.  But by the end of last year, the relationship had begun to sour over policy differences. The kisses gave way to terse formalities and tight-lipped smiles whenever they met.  By early last month, Mr. Macron took off the gloves. He said that the United States under Mr. Trump appeared to be “turning its back on us,” and that a lack of American leadership and strategic coordination had led to NATO experiencing “brain death.” By the time the two leaders appeared together at a news conference on Tuesday, the bromance appeared to have run its course. At one point, Mr. Trump called Mr. Macron’s diplomatic response to a question “one of the greatest nonanswers I have ever heard.” And in one particularly heated exchange, as the two discussed the containment of ISIS fighters in Syria, Mr. Trump tried to jokingly offer captive fighters to the French.  “Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?” Mr. Trump said. “Let’s be serious,” was Mr. Macron’s curt reply. When Mr. Trump met with President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil in the White House for the first time in March, he had nothing but praise for the newly elected leader.  “I think Brazil’s relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it’s ever been by far,” Mr. Trump gushed.  Mr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, had been criticized as an apologist for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for decades, and had made demeaning comments about women, minorities and homosexuals. But despite this, Mr. Trump welcomed him with warmth and promises that their personal relationship would help forge closer trade cooperation. Their similarly brash personas and populist appeal had many predicting a harmonious future, and Mr. Bolsonaro soon made his close relationship with the American president part of the foundation of his diplomacy.  His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker in Brazil’s lower house, even wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again — Trump 2020 when he visited the White House. But relations have apparently cooled. On Monday Mr. Trump pledged to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina, accusing both countries of manipulating their currencies at the expense of American farmers.  Mr. Bolsonaro on Tuesday said he would take the issue up directly with Mr. Trump. But the tariffs may make it difficult for the two to resume their once cozy relationship.  Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada — who has won international praise for his gender-balanced cabinet and progressive policies — seemed unlikely to develop a close friendship. But for Mr. Trudeau, getting along with the powerful neighbor to the south is a priority. So soon after Mr. Trump’s election, the Canadian prime minister embarked on a charm offensive, inviting Mr. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, to take part in a meeting of female business leaders, for example. At least for a while, this kind of outreach seemed to work.  During Mr. Trudeau’s first visit with Mr. Trump at the White House in 2017, the leaders exchanged niceties and talked around policy issues. Mr. Trump later spoke of their “great personal relationship” when negotiations for a new North American Free Trade Agreement began.  The issue of trade, though, would prove their downfall. Their breakup began in May 2018, when Mr. Trump announced that he was expanding tariffs on steel and aluminum to include Canada, the biggest exporter of the two metals to the United States. Canada returned the favor, swiftly announcing its own tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of American goods.  A tense phone call followed — in which Mr. Trump brought up unfounded accusations of 200-year-old acts of aggression by Canada against the United States. By the time the Group of 7 summit meeting rolled round in June 2018, they were no longer holding back.  “Canadians are polite, we’re reasonable but we also will not be pushed around,” Mr. Trudeau said.  Mr. Trump bailed on the meeting early, and sent a pair of tweets calling Mr. Trudeau “very dishonest & weak.” He said the United States would not sign the agreement that the other participants had agreed on. Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan have logged a lot of hours together. They visited a sumo arena. They had dinners with their spouses. And they played golf — both at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and during a May visit by the American president to Tokyo. “We got to know each other very, very well” on the golf course, Mr. Trump told reporters in 2017. Aligning himself to Mr. Trump has been a critical part of Mr. Abe’s strategy to secure a beneficial bilateral trade deal with the United States, an agreement Mr. Trump had vowed would “be something very exciting.” And when Mr. Trump visited Tokyo, Mr. Abe described the occasion as an opportunity to enshrine the “unshakable bond” between them.  But Mr. Trump spent much of his time during that visit focusing on domestic issues, and in some cases his own grievances rather than relations with Japan. And despite the dinners and time together, the two have been able to agree on only a limited trade deal that leaves out Japanese cars, industrial goods from the United States and farm products like rice, butter and sugar. For Mr. Abe, the question is whether his investment in courting Mr. Trump has been worth it.  ']",President Trump has a history of falling out with his friends. President Emmanuel Macron of France is the latest.
"In Syria, Health Workers Risk Becoming ‘Enemies of the State’",2019-12-04,By Rick Gladstone and Malachy Browne,"['The nearly 9-year-old conflict in Syria has been punctuated by repeated violations of what is considered acceptable in war, including the military’s use of chemical weapons, torture of prisoners and recurrent bombings of hospitals in rebel-held areas. Less attention has been paid to another outcome: the government’s criminalization of medical care. On Wednesday, Physicians for Human Rights, a group that has documented the collapse of Syria’s health care system, released a study asserting that over the course of the war, President Bashar al-Assad has successfully made medical assistance to his enemies a crime.  Whether it is disinfecting a fighter’s wound or even supplying painkillers to clinics in an insurgent-held neighborhood, such acts are punishable under a counterterrorism law enacted by Mr. al-Assad’s government just over a year after the conflict began in March of 2011. A special court has tried tens of thousands under the law, including many medical workers. “This report illustrates how the Syrian government has effectively criminalized the provision of nondiscriminatory care to all, regardless of political affiliation,” Physicians for Human Rights said in the study. Health workers who provide care in line with their legal and ethical obligations, it said, are branded as “enemies of the state” in Syria. The study is based on extensive interviews with 21 formerly detained Syrian health care workers who have fled the country, including seven physicians, four pharmacists, three medical volunteers, one paramedic and one psychiatrist. All said they had endured torture and interrogations while imprisoned and did not want to be identified by name, fearing retribution against their families or against themselves if they ever returned.  A majority of them were arrested, the study said, “because of their status as care providers, and their real or perceived involvement in the provision of health services to opposition members and sympathizers.” The New York Times interviewed three of them who said they had been detained and interrogated for months. They described cells so cramped that inmates took turns to rest. Two of them — a pharmacist and a surgeon — said they had been arrested at their workplaces. Most of the former detainees described a similar process of extracting confessions that could be prosecuted under the counterterrorism law, the Physicians for Human Rights study said. “Most had judicial review of their cases by either military field courts, military courts, or counterterrorism court, where due process protections are suspended in practice,” it said. There was no immediate comment by the Syrian authorities to the study. Mr. al-Assad’s government has repeatedly defended the counterterrorism law as a necessity for what he contends is his success in retaking and stabilizing most of the country, where by some estimates a half-million people have been killed and roughly half the prewar population of 22 million have fled their homes. Ibrahim al-Kasem, a Syrian lawyer who used to represent detainees, said that trials in military courts are held in secret, and detainees can be tried in the counterterrorism court without their lawyers. In such settings, he said, “the judges have the ability to do anything.” Mr. al-Kasem is now the executive director of the Caesar-File Group, established after a Syrian military police photographer code-named “Caesar” released 55,000 images in 2014 believed to show evidence of the systematic torture and death of thousands of detainees. Rights activists and legal scholars say the counterterrorism law itself is exceedingly vague on what constitutes terrorism so that even peaceful acts could be prosecuted. They say the law also violates a precept of the Geneva Conventions that obliges doctors and other health care professionals to treat the wounded and sick, regardless which side they may support. “The law is problematic,” said Mai El-Sadany, legal and judicial director at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington-based research group. “The reality is that under this law, anyone could be a terrorist.” When and if the Syria war ends, she said, keeping such a law on the books would present an enormous challenge to rebuilding the country. “How can people begin to return to a state where they suffer the risk of prosecution?” she said.  Mr. al-Assad’s government was a pioneer in the targeting of health care workers as a battlefield strategy, and has been ignoring criticism of the policy for years. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry, a panel of investigators that has been collecting evidence of human rights violations in Syria, said back in 2013 that government forces had been systematically denying treatment to the sick and wounded in areas controlled by the opposition.  “The denial of medical care as a weapon of war is a distinct and chilling reality of the war in Syria,” the panel said. Michiel Hofman, the senior humanitarian specialist at Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity that operates in insurgent-held areas of northern Syria, traced the targeting of health care workers to the prelude to the war, when peaceful protesters wounded by Mr. al-Assad’s security forces sought treatment at hospitals. “The authorities said, yes you can treat people but you have to report the patients to the police. Patients didn’t want to be reported to the police, so health care workers created clinics in homes and underground hospitals,” Mr. Hofman said. “The Syrian authorities regarded these hospitals as illegal, right from the start, and a vicious cycle was created early in the conflict.”  Asked about the prospects for rebuilding Syria’s health care system, Mr. Hofman was pessimistic.  “The reason for the persecution of medical workers has not been removed,” he said. “Attacks on health care have become the new normal.” The vast majority of detainees interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights said they would not go back to Syria under the current conditions, said Rayan Koteiche, one of the study’s authors. “The continuing threat and persecution of professions including medical professionals is a huge barrier to returning,” he said. “To freely practice in accordance with their code of ethics — they don’t see that as possible.” Carlotta Gall, Jack Ewing and Karam Shoumali contributed reporting.

"‘I Don’t Know Prince Andrew,’ Trump Says. Photos Say Otherwise.",2019-12-03,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — President Trump denied on Tuesday that he knew Prince Andrew, the son of Queen Elizabeth II who has become entangled in sexual abuse accusations against the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. “I don’t know him, no,” the president told reporters gathered in London for the NATO summit.  But photographs show they have met several times over the past 20 years, and as recently as June when the prince, known formally as the Duke of York, hosted a breakfast meeting for Mr. Trump during his state visit to Britain. Those photos were posted on the prince’s Twitter account.  Mr. Trump also toured Westminster Abbey in London with the prince, and they were photographed laughing together.  The prince  announced last month that he was stepping back from public life after a disastrous television interview in which he tried to defend his connection to Mr. Epstein and said he had no recollection of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has testified that she was ordered to have sex with the prince.  Ms. Giuffre, who has also spoken publicly about being abused by Mr. Epstein, reiterated the accusations in a British television interview of her own on Monday. The prince has denied any wrongdoing in his interactions with Mr. Epstein, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 on a charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor. The financier hanged himself in a Manhattan jail in August while awaiting trial on new sex-trafficking charges. Mr. Trump has sometimes sought to distance himself from people whom it has become painful or perilous to discuss, including Matthew G. Whitaker, his rejected choice for attorney general; and Gordon D. Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union.   Earlier photos also show Mr. Trump together with the prince, the queen’s third child. Mr. Trump and his then-girlfriend, Melania Knauss — now the first lady — were seen with the prince at least twice in 2000: once at the opening of Hudson Hotel in New York and, more intimately, at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.  Mr. Trump also told reporters on Tuesday that he did not know anything about Jeremy Corbyn, the  main rival of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the upcoming election.  “Jeremy Corbyn?” Mr. Trump said. “Know nothing about him.” But the president had given an opinion on Mr. Corbyn as recently as last month, on a London-based radio show.  “Corbyn would be so bad for your country, he’d be so bad, he’d take you in such a bad way,” Mr. Trump said. “He’d take you into such bad places.”']","Speaking to reporters in London, President Trump denied knowing Prince Andrew, despite having been photographed with him on several occasions.

Charges Planned Against Netanyahu Aides in Submarine Graft Scandal,2019-12-05,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Two former close aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel are among those facing likely criminal charges in one of the country’s biggest corruption scandals yet, arising from the multibillion-dollar purchase of submarines and missile boats from Germany. A former chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu, David Sharan, is accused of accepting bribes from an Israeli agent for the shipbuilder, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. David Shimron, who has served as a personal lawyer and close confidant to Mr. Netanyahu and is also his second cousin, is accused of laundering money to help the shipbuilder’s agent, Michael Ganor, conceal his role in a separate financial transaction. The case is not related to last month’s indictment of Mr. Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, but adds to the cloud lingering over him and his political future. The charges against Mr. Netanyahu’s former aides are only tentative at this point. The two men — as well as the others facing the charges — are entitled to a hearing at which they can try to persuade prosecutors to drop or reduce the charges before an indictment is issued. They have all denied wrongdoing.  Unable to form a government after two inconclusive elections this year, Mr. Netanyahu is hanging onto office by a fraying thread. He is widely expected to force Israel to a third vote in March, despite growing calls for a leadership primary from within his own party, Likud. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned in the so-called submarine affair but was not named as a suspect. But with his personal lawyer and former chief of staff both facing charges, and another man he appointed as national security adviser also implicated, critics say that if Mr. Netanyahu did not know what was going on under his watch, he should have. “Serious indictments are served against those closest to Netanyahu, and he didn’t know?” Moshe Yaalon, a former defense minister under Mr. Netanyahu and now a political rival, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. Mr. Yaalon, a leader of the Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz, a former military chief, opposed the purchase of additional submarines while in office.  Pointing to Mr. Netanyahu’s approval of the sale of advanced German submarines to Egypt behind the backs of Israel’s defense minister and military chief of staff, Mr. Yaalon added: “A government headed by Blue and White would establish a commission of inquiry in order to expose the truth on subjects that have not been fully probed in general, and regarding Mr. Netanyahu in particular.”  He said questions he had posed to the attorney general more than a year ago remained unanswered. At the center of the submarine case is Mr. Ganor, an Israeli businessman whose old navy buddies held powerful positions.  One, Eliezer Marom, was the commander of the Israeli navy. Another, Avriel Bar-Yosef, was a deputy chief of the National Security Council, and was Mr. Netanyahu’s appointee to lead the council in 2016.  Prosecutors say the three conspired beginning in 2009 to help persuade ThyssenKrupp to name Mr. Ganor as its sales agent in Israel. Mr. Ganor earned millions of dollars in commissions on Israel’s purchases of vessels from ThyssenKrupp, prosecutors said, and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to Mr. Bar-Yosef and Mr. Marom. Mr. Ganor also bribed Mr. Sharan, prosecutors say, beginning in 2013, when Mr. Sharan was an aide to the Israeli minister of finance. The payments, which totaled about $35,000, continued for some two years after Mr. Sharan was named Mr. Netanyahu’s chief of staff. Mr. Ganor, who was a neighbor of Mr. Netanyahu’s in Caesarea, on Israel’s northern coast, turned state’s evidence in 2017 but changed his testimony earlier this year, and his cooperation agreement was canceled in May. He faces charges of bribery, money laundering and tax offenses. Mr. Marom was also named as a likely defendant. Prosecutors have not announced whether they intend to pursue charges against Mr. Bar-Yosef. Prosecutors appear to have retreated somewhat from the case that police had initially mustered against Mr. Shimron, Mr. Netanyahu’s cousin and lawyer, who also represented Mr. Ganor in his dealings with ThyssenKrupp. Investigators had recommended charging Mr. Shimron with bribery, saying he had taken nearly $75,000 in bribes as a “reward for success” after “opening doors” and influencing officials in favor of the vessel purchases. But the state prosecutor’s office on Thursday accused Mr. Shimron of what appeared to be an unrelated crime.  Mr. Ganor, prosecutors said, had been paid a $140,000 fee for helping an Israeli foundation identify new investments. But for unexplained reasons, Mr. Ganor did not want to be named in a brokerage agreement. At his request, prosecutors said, Mr. Shimron posed as the broker in exchange for 20 percent of Mr. Ganor’s fee. But in doing so, and to arrange that payment, the two men filed false documents with Bank Hapoalim, prosecutors said. Mr. Shimron belittled the charges against him.  “I’ve now received the indictment and reviewed it,” he said, according to Israeli public radio. “There are no submarines in it. There’s no bribery in it. There’s no fraud in it. So what is in it? A technical violation described with pomposity and with significant factual mistakes, which is why during the hearing that, too, will be tossed.”']","Indicted and embattled, Israel’s prime minister faces new calls for yet another corruption inquiry."
Spain’s ‘Big Brother’ Accused of Recording Sexual Assault and Making Victim Watch,2019-12-05,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — A contestant on a Spanish reality television show says she was sexually assaulted by another contestant while she was unconscious — an attack that was recorded. The show’s producers then forced her to watch and filmed her reaction. Two years later, it has all burst into the open, with the recent leak of a video in which the woman, then 24, can be seen sobbing after the show’s staff made her watch images of her own assault.  The video of her pained reaction has spread widely on social media, prompting a national backlash against the show, “Gran Hermano” — the Spanish version of “Big Brother” — and against what campaigners against sex crimes and harassment say is a culture that still does not take the problems seriously enough. The leaked video, shown in Spanish media and posted  online, shows the woman watching the recording, then weeping, pacing and burying her face in her hands. She begs to go talk to “her friends out there,” but an offscreen member of the show’s staff tells her that she cannot see her friends and should not tell anyone what happened. The entire episode — her being confronted with the video of the assault, her horrified response to it and her exchange with a staff member, who tells her to “relax” — all happened with the cameras rolling. The crew recorded the scene as if it were another part of the action, one of the interviews they conduct with contestants after key moments on the show. The leak coincided with news that an investigating judge had decided to pursue a criminal case, though so far no one has been indicted. Video of the alleged assault itself has not been seen publicly. But the unseen staff member in the leaked video said the male contestant, who had struck up a romantic relationship with the woman after meeting her on the show, offered her support, even as the camera tracked her pacing and crying.  The production company reported the man to the police hours later, and expelled him from the show. The broadcaster released a statement explaining that he had been ousted for “intolerable” behavior, but gave no details. The production staff has been broadly condemned for the failure to intervene, and for treating the young woman in a way that she and critics of the show say traumatized her. Last week, Zeppelin TV, the company that produces “Big Brother” in Spain, issued an apology to the woman and said it would put in place rules to avoid anything similar happening, notably by banning alcohol from the set. But the statement did not dampen public outrage, which has driven dozens of corporate sponsors to drop the show. “They allowed him to stay by my side many hours when they had sufficient proof to get him out immediately and then decide what to do with him,” the young woman, Carlota Prado, said in an interview with El Confidencial, the publication that first obtained the leaked video. The production staff allowed the man, José María López, who was also 24 at the time, “to laugh at my face by telling me that he looked after me,” she said. In the interview, she said she had resisted Mr. López’s advances in the presence of other contestants, and again in a bedroom before losing consciousness. “I cannot understand how the program allowed this,” she said. Before showing her the video of assault, she said, the production team gave no hint of what she was about to see, magnifying the shock. Given a choice, she said, she would not have viewed it. A representative of Mr. López could not be reached for comment. Gregorio Gómez Mata, the director of Alma, a group that fights gender-based violence, argued that anybody who was involved in the episode, down to each individual cameraman, should appear in court for failing to assist a person in danger. “You cannot watch a crime and do nothing about it,” he said. “Sadly, ‘Big Brother’ maintains high levels of audience, which tells us a lot about our society.” There have been mass street protests in Spain against some recent court rulings in sexual assault cases. Women’s groups have accused Spanish judges of paternalism and bias for demanding that victims demonstrate that they had fought back against their attackers. Last month, prosecutors announced that they would appeal a recent verdict in which five men were convicted of the sexual abuse of an unconscious 14-year-old girl in the town of Manresa, but not the more serious crime of rape, because the court ruled that they had not used violence.  Miguel Lorente, a former chief of a national government agency that deals with sexual violence, said the “Big Brother” case, like the one in Manresa, raised the question of whether Spain’s judiciary recognized obligations on the part of witnesses. One man was cleared of wrongdoing in the Manresa attack though he had watched it while masturbating. “Big Brother” throws strangers together in a confined space and records all of their interactions, hoping that the forced intimacy will create sparks, positive or negative. On the night of the incident, Ms. Prado had been drinking heavily at a party with other contestants, but apparently not Mr. López. In a video clip from the show, a man can be seen pulling at the waistband of her pants, stroking her hair and gripping her wrists, while she repeatedly seems to fend him off, before they walk off together. The next day, Ms. Prado, who said she had no memory of an assault, was made to watch the video of her alone with Mr. López. The viewing took place in the show’s “diary room,” where a contestant is interviewed on camera by someone who is not in the shot. A sobbing Ms. Prado was guaranteed by the off-camera person that nobody from the public would see the same images. She asked to confront Mr. López, but was told that she would not be able to speak with him again. The unseen person told her that the makers of “Big Brother” condemned what had taken place and would give her full psychological support, while offering her the possibility to leave the show “without any kind of penalty.” Ms. Prado requested medication to help her calm down, and said her heart was racing, but instead she was asked to sit on a sofa and “relax.” When she asked to speak to some of her friends outside the house, the person insisted that she had to wait, and that “this matter, for the sake of José María and you, for the sake of both, should not get out of here.” She paced the room, angry and crying: “What do I have to wait for? I won’t say anything, I understood what you have said.” Finally, a woman who identified herself as a member of the show’s casting department walked into the room and hugged Ms. Prado, who continued to sob. The producers took her to a hotel for a few days, after which she decided to rejoin the show.  Mediaset, the company that broadcasts “Big Brother” in Spain, issued a statement recently accusing its main rival media group in Spain of using the case of Ms. Prado to fuel a “denigratory campaign” against the show.  When the season that featured Ms. Prado ended, in December 2017, the show switched to featuring only celebrity contestants rather than ordinary people. Zeppelin did not say whether the change was prompted by what had happened to Ms. Prado.  “What seems to have failed completely is putting themselves in the place of the victim,” said Mr. Lorente, the former government official. He said that the case showed that “Spain has put in place the laws, but we still live in a far too permissive society.”']","A former contestant on the reality show says its staff stood by as she was sexually assaulted while unconscious, then filmed her emotional reaction to a video of the assault.

General Strike in France Challenges Macron’s Latest Ambition for Change,2019-12-05,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — The streets of French cities were filled with anti-government demonstrators, tear gas and police officers on Thursday as Emmanuel Macron again faced what has become an emblem of his presidency: social unrest. This time it was a general strike over his plans to overhaul the country’s pension system. Much of the country came to a halt as transport workers went on a strike that could last into next week. By some estimates nearly half a million took part nationwide in the demonstrations. Trains, subways and buses were canceled, many schools were closed, and thousands were forced to stay home from work across the country. In Paris, smoke billowed from the Place de la République and the wide Boulevard de Magenta was packed shoulder-to-shoulder with unionists furious with Mr. Macron. In Rennes, protesters smashed store windows; in Nantes, the riot police pushed the crowds back with tear gas; in Lyon, scuffles broke out between the police and demonstrators. But behind the anger was the much-contested figure of the president himself, a former investment banker who was elected two and half years ago promising to shake up a secure but sclerotic French system deemed too unfriendly to business, growth and job creation.  His latest ambition — to merge France’s complex of 42 different generous pension schemes into one state-managed system — scares fellow citizens. And his sometimes imperious personal style continues to grate on many.  On Thursday, it was Mr. Macron who united their popular anger once again, exactly as he did a year ago when members of the protest movement known as the Yellow Vests guillotined him in effigy on the country’s roundabouts.  Analysts pointed out that Thursday’s protests completed the circle of anger against Mr. Macron begun last year by the Yellow Vests.  The Yellow Vests could only demonstrate on Saturdays because, marginally employed, they could not risk their jobs. On Thursday, it was the unionized employed — teachers, hospital workers, some civil servants — who came out, who weren’t risking employment, but who were expressing many of the same anxieties. “The government has inflamed unease with this reform. It is the other France that is revolting today,” said the economist Daniel Cohen of France’s top-ranked École Normale Supérieure. “Last year it was the cutoff France, and this year it’s the unions, the teachers.” And that junction — two anxious parts of the nation coming together in anger — spells big trouble for Mr. Macron’s government. Indeed, some of the former Yellow Vests demonstrated with the unionists Thursday, though they had held them at arms length all through their own protests last year. Mr. Macron might be wishing he could have stayed at the NATO gathering in London that ended Wednesday. There, he was in the posture that appears to suit him well, at least in his own eyes: leader of Europe, and the only continental leader who can stand up to President Trump. His curt dismissal of Mr. Trump — “Let’s be serious” — has already become an iconic moment in the marginalization of the American president as a considered interlocutor on the world stage. In the past Mr. Macron’s advisers frequently attempted to play up the supposed similarities between the two men — both outsiders, both non-politicians who defied the odds — to show that they could find common ground.  On Thursday, they had something else in common. Both Mr. Macron and Mr. Trump returned home to serious messes. His fellow European leaders have ceded first place to Mr. Macron nearly by default, even if he irritates them by pushing unilateral initiatives he appears convinced are absolutely right. The problem for Mr. Macron is that this approach irritates his fellow citizens as well. That friction has developed as a serious obstacle to his will to change France, promised in the campaign manifesto he entitled Revolution two years ago. He is now less popular in his homeland than Mr. Trump in his. At the Élysée Palace on Thursday, seat of the French presidency, a senior official said Mr. Macron was “calm and determined” in the face of the strike. That was not the mood on the street. Today, much of the anger directed at the French president in the crowds coursing through the streets was nearly personal.  Benoît Martin, a leading union official with the leftist CGT, which is leading the charge on the strike, framed it as all about Mr. Macron himself. “It expresses a sort of resistance to Macron’s power,” Mr. Martin said. True, Mr. Macron’s plans by themselves spark fear in a nervous France demanding more security, not less. The current pension system is one of the world’s most protective, for all its flaws. Many French are asking why a plan of uncertain contours and outcomes should be substituted for it. But Mr. Macron argues that the current byzantine system is both unaffordable and unfair. It could be headed for a deficit of about $19 billion, and its disparities allow workers in some sectors to retire years ahead of others.  While Mr. Macron is not proposing to spend less on pensions or to make people retire later, he aims to simplify the system, raising fears that he will reshuffle its winners and losers. The pension plan is not the first of Mr. Macron’s reforms to face resistance. His changes to the status of the country’s railway workers and revamping of France’s voluminous labor code met similarly fierce protests on the street.  Some of those changes made it easier to hire and fire workers and have helped nudge down a stubborn unemployment rate that once hovered around 10 percent to about 8.4 percent this year. Yet for many French the perceived benefits don’t outweigh the feeling of insecurity they have introduced. Beyond that there is striking disaffection with the way Mr. Macron goes about presenting himself and his ideas. He talks to the French, often at great length and in stupendous detail. But it doesn’t reassure them. Marc Veslin, 56, and Ludovic Varlet, 52, hospital workers demonstrating near the Place de la République, said they did not trust Mr. Macron. He hadn’t explained his pension reform plan at all. “We have nothing, no information,” Mr. Veslin said. Mr. Varlet said he was particularly angry with Mr. Macron. “It’s him and everything he represents,” he said, adding: “Finance is governing.” Mr. Varlet chimed in: “It was the best system in the world. And they are about to destroy it.” Philippe Lauberthe, a railway worker who joined the demonstration called Mr. Macron “the president of curt little phrases,” referring to Mr. Macron’s early penchant, since repressed, for uttering words seen as dismissive by his fellow citizens. “Macron isn’t taking into account the expectations of the French,” said a teacher who would only give her name as Christine. “He is completely out to lunch.” She added, speaking of his government: “They don’t communicate enough with people.” The sentiment was widely expressed on the streets on Thursday. “This government is rotten,’’ said Sophie Prevost, a magazine editor, lighting a cigarette as she left the Châtelet train station. ‘‘They think only of numbers, not of people.” Mr. Cohen, the economist, has argued that Mr. Macron’s large spate of financial concessions to the Yellow Vests last year — nearly $19 billion in tax breaks and income supplements — was not sufficient to deal with the more profound underlying problem in France. The concessions added about $900 in purchasing power to working and middle-class households. But that was not enough. Thursday’s demonstrations may have offered additional proof. “The social tissue of the working classes is very frayed,” said Mr. Cohen. “There’s an economic and anthropological insecurity.”  The government, he added, “has a blanket that’s too short.” Pulling it up — in tax cuts last year to satisfy the Yellow Vests — only added to the chill of those dependent on public spending, like the people demonstrating Thursday. Mr. Macron appeared out of step: on the European stage, he is a liberal democrat in a world of mounting populism, and at home he is “profoundly out of step, in respect to populations that are demanding more protection,” said Mr. Cohen. As with the Yellow Vest protests last year, much will depend on the battle for public opinion. The government was forced to listen, and keep a check on police repression, for as long as there was popular support for that movement. When that support dwindled toward 50 percent, the government shut its ears and unleashed the police. Polls released Thursday, before the beginning of the strike, showed popular support for it at close to 70 percent.  “What will play for Emmanuel Macron and Edouard Philippe,” his prime minister, “is public opinion,” said Mr. Garrigues, the political historian. “They’re playing on the degeneration of the movement in public opinion,” as with the Yellow Vests, he said. But playing against that is the solitary nature of power as conceived by Mr. Macron himself.  “The nature of his movement is that it is constructed around one man,’’ Mr. Garrigues said. ‘‘So there’s very little room to maneuver.”  Reporting was contributed by Aurelien Breeden and Liz Alderman in Paris, and by Elian Peltier in London.

Japan Plans to Spend $120 Billion to Stimulate Slowing Economy,2019-12-05,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — Japan will spend nearly $120 billion to stimulate its slowing economy and to help some of the areas worst affected by Typhoon Hagibis, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Thursday. The new spending plan is aimed at addressing a slew of economic challenges facing Japan’s longtime leader, who has built his reputation on the country’s stronger growth after years of stagnation.  But the stimulus package, if passed, would continue Japan’s cycle of borrowing and spending to stoke growth and pay for the country’s expanding social welfare costs to support a rapidly aging population. The country already has the biggest debt load in the developed world relative to the size of its economy.  Mr. Abe’s administration has pledged to reverse the borrowing trend. Just two months ago the government raised the country’s consumption tax to help shore up the country’s finances, only to see retail sales slump. In announcing the much-anticipated package of more than 13 trillion yen, Mr. Abe told a meeting of his governing Liberal Democratic Party that the economic measures were meant to “overcome downside risks” and help the country “maintain or enhance economic viability” after the 2020 Olympics, which Tokyo will host next summer. Japan has recently struggled as a weakening global economy and trade rifts have taken the air out of the country’s recovery. A slowdown in demand from China, a major consumer of Japanese-made assembly line equipment, has already curtailed Japan’s growth, which fell below economists’ expectations in the third quarter. The country has also recently felt the effects of a political spat with South Korea that has led Koreans to boycott purchases of products like Japanese beer and severely curtail tourism to Japan. The typhoon in October, the worst to hit the country in 50 years, also exposed the need for new infrastructure to help protect the country against increasingly menacing storms and flooding in the era of climate change. More broadly, Japan faces difficult long-term economic challenges. Its population is aging, and its female labor force continues to suffer from deep underemployment. Some economists have argued that Japan needs more substantial structural changes to lift its economy over the longer term. The government expects the stimulus package to lift private-sector spending by up to an additional 13 trillion yen. The public portion of the stimulus package will be financed by government bonds and the country’s general account. Some economists said the package was smaller than expected. “Even though the total amount seems to be big, the actual amount that the central government is injecting is not so big,” said Takuya Hoshino, deputy chief economist at Daiichi Life Research Institute. “This will not be much of a power boost to the economy as the budget is not increased from the previous year.” According to NHK, the public broadcaster, the package includes spending to reinforce riverbanks and create improved hazard maps to prepare for natural disasters, along with support for exports of agricultural and marine products. The government also plans to hire workers who were never able to get a foothold in the full-time labor force during Japan’s “lost decade” of the 1990s. And it will provide subsidies to aging drivers to install safety equipment such as automatic brakes in their cars to help make them safer to drive. “It makes sense in almost every regard,” said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management in Tokyo. “The amount is large but not too large. I don’t think anyone is going to think this is profligate spending.” He added: “Improving the aging infrastructure and preventing loss of life from typhoon damage is money well spent.” The stimulus announced Thursday in Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, is one of its largest allocations of public funds to jump-start its economy. The spending will push up Japan’s debt level, which is currently more than two and a half times the nation’s total annual economic output and the largest among 188 countries. In October, the government increased a consumption tax on a wide variety of goods and services to 10 percent from 8 percent in part to help pay down that enormous debt as well as to pay ballooning welfare costs that support Japan’s rapidly aging population. By issuing government bonds, Japan could be derailing its plan to bring down its debt at a time when the economy was still growing, albeit slowly, said Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research. “The economy is not that bad at this point,” Mr. Saito. “There are risks of course but I am not sure if fiscal spending is appropriate at this time.” Makiko Inoue, Hisako Ueno and Eimi Yamamitsu contributed reporting.']",Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced the spending as the country’s economy has slowed because of reduced demand from China and tensions with South Korea.
‘The Amazon Is Completely Lawless’: The Rainforest After Bolsonaro’s First Year,2019-12-05,By Victor Moriyama and Matt Sandy,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — When the smoke cleared, the Amazon could breathe easy again. For months, black clouds had hung over the rainforest as work crews burned and chain-sawed through it. Now the rainy season had arrived, offering a respite to the jungle and a clearer view of the damage to the world. The picture that emerged was anything but reassuring: Brazil’s space agency reported that in one year, more than 3,700 square miles of the Amazon had been razed — a swath of jungle nearly the size of Lebanon torn from the world’s largest rainforest. It was the highest loss in Brazilian rainforest in a decade, and stark evidence of just how badly the Amazon, an important buffer against global warming, has fared in Brazil’s first year under President Jair Bolsonaro.  He has vowed to open the rainforest to industry and scale back its protections, and his government has followed through, cutting funds and staffing to weaken the enforcement of environmental laws. In the absence of federal agents, waves of loggers, ranchers and miners moved in, emboldened by the president and eager to satisfy global demand.  Deforestation soared, up almost 30 percent from the year before.  “It confirms the Amazon is completely lawless,” Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist with the University of São Paulo, said of the data. “The environmental criminals feel more and more empowered.” He warned that the Amazon may soon cross a tipping point and begin to self-destruct. “Law enforcement has reached its minimum effectiveness in a decade,” he said. “It is a worrying warning for the future.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s government has made some nods to combating illegal clear-cutting, but the president has reaffirmed his longstanding position of disdain toward conservation work. He once said that Brazil’s environmental policy was “suffocating the country”; he vowed on the campaign trail that not “a square centimeter” of land would be designated for Indigenous people; and last month he brushed aside official data about deforestation. His stance has been widely noted on the Amazon frontier, where the rainforest is transformed into land for cattle, soybeans and other crops in a process that can be murky, sometimes illegal and frequently violent.  “Deforestation and fires have always been a problem, but this is the first time it has happened thanks to the discourse and activities of the federal government,” said Marina Silva, who as environment minister in the mid-2000s cracked down on illegal activity in the Amazon, contributing to an 83 percent fall in deforestation from 2004 to 2012. Around 2014, Brazil started sliding into a deep recession, and deforestation began to rise as ranchers and loggers searched for new land to exploit. The Amazon, relied on for centuries for rubber trees, minerals and fertile land, was the obvious place to go. Agribusiness, always a force in Brazil, gained even more economic and political power: It now represents nearly a quarter of the country’s G.D.P., and the Amazon region supports soybean farms, gold and iron ore mines and ranches holding more than 50 million cattle. These industries found an ally in Mr. Bolsonaro, a far-right, pro-business lawmaker before he shot to the presidency last year. His government, Ms. Silva said, “is not fighting to preserve environmental governance.”  Deforestation began to rise before Mr. Bolsonaro took office in January. By the height of the dry season in July and August, some experts feared that criminal loggers and ranchers, who use fire to prepare land for crops and pasture, were clearing the Amazon with impunity.  Their fires drew international attention, especially as images spread online of jungle blazes, charred trees and the smoke-darkened sky over Brazil’s largest city, São Paulo, 1,800 miles southeast of the rainforest. More than 80,000 fires were detected since the start of the year, according to government data. The fires turned into a major diplomatic crisis for Mr. Bolsonaro, pitting him against a global backlash of politicians, celebrities and popular opinion. France threatened to block a major trade deal, and Norway and Germany halted donations to protect the rainforest. After initially remaining defiant, Mr. Bolsonaro mobilized the military to tackle the flames and issued a decree banning fires in the Amazon for 60 days.  The furor reached such a pitch that Brazil’s businesses became worried about the potential impact. “Did we have our image harmed? Yes. Can we recover it? Yes. The government has to align its discourse to what the world wants,” said Blairo Maggi, a billionaire soybean producer and former agriculture minister known as the Soy King. “The farmers, associations and industry will have to redo what has been lost,” he said. “We retreated 10 steps; we will have to work to get back to where we were.” The people who work the land have expressed conflicting feelings about the deforestation. For some, the fires are a dual threat, spewing dangerous smoke and destroying a forest that has always provided a livelihood. For others, the fires create much-needed jobs, all the more valuable amid Brazil’s sluggish economy. The push into the Amazon has also been driven by demand from abroad. Every year, Brazil exports nearly 15 million tons of soy, much of it to China, and more than $6 billion worth of beef — more than any other country in history. Cattle ranches account for up to 80 percent of deforested land in the Amazon, according to the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Major beef and soy firms have been fined millions for buying commodities sourced from illegally deforested land, but such rules have proved difficult to enforce. Last week, the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said that the authorities needed a new strategy to stop illegal logging and mining, but he has not outlined a plan. And despite the more conciliatory tone taken by Mr. Salles and businessmen like Mr. Maggi, Mr. Bolsonaro has again voiced an aggressive, nationalistic view of the Amazon, describing the rainforest as a resource to be exploited.  Last week, he falsely accused the actor Leonardo DiCaprio of bankrolling fires in the Amazon, and for months he has also dismissed Indigenous people’s concerns about increasing invasions of protected land by loggers and miners, even as Indigenous groups have pleaded with the government for protection from growing violence. Many environmentalists directly blame Mr. Bolsonaro for the increase in deforestation, citing his firing of key officials at the main environmental regulator, IBAMA, and his refusal to endorse anti-logging operations. “If the federal government does not profoundly change its stance on the issue,” said Mauricio Voivodic, the executive director of WWF Brasil, deforestation “will grow even more next year, causing the country to go back 30 years in terms of protecting the Amazon.” The Amazon’s future may depend on whether that happens, with serious implications for global warming.  The rainforest stores a huge volume of carbon dioxide, which is unleashed through the fires. From January through July, deforestation and fires in the Brazilian Amazon released between 115 and 155 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions — roughly the total for the state of North Carolina — according to an analysis by the Woods Hole Research Center and IPAM-Amazônia.  “Deforestation data for the last three months also shows a very sharp increase,” said Mr. Nobre, the climate scientist. Scientists also warn that decades of destruction have brought the forest close to a tipping point, in which lower rainfall and longer dry seasons would turn most of it into savanna. According to research by Mr. Nobre, the tipping point will likely be reached at 20 to 25 percent of deforestation across the Amazon basin — or even sooner, depending on the rate of climate change. There is no accurate measure of deforestation across the nine countries containing the Amazon, but many researchers believe about 17 percent of the forest has been lost already. Whether this year’s figures represent an acceleration of that process or an exception to the trend will only become evident next summer, when the dry season returns. Speaking to reporters last month, Mr. Bolsonaro predicted smoke would be back with it. “Deforestation and fires will never end,” he said. “It’s cultural.” ']",
Anti-Semitic Imagery Could Cost Belgian Carnival Its UNESCO Status,2019-12-05,By Claire Moses,"['The city of Aalst, Belgium, faces the prospect of an unheard-of demotion: A decade after declaring its Carnival celebrations a valued cultural expression, UNESCO could revoke that designation over anti-Semitic imagery that has been part of the revelry. So the city’s mayor, Christoph D’Haese, has tried to beat UNESCO to the punch. In a classic “you can’t fire me — I quit” moment, he sent the agency a letter on Tuesday, renouncing Aalst’s place on the list before it could be kicked off. The mayor’s office does not have the authority to leave the agency’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list of its own accord, and such a request would have to come from Belgium’s UNESCO delegation, a spokeswoman for the international group said. The committee in charge of the list plans to consider whether to remove Aalst at a meeting on Dec. 12 in Bogotá, Colombia, said the spokeswoman, Aurelia du Vignau. “It’s still in the hands of the committee,” she said. The mayor’s action “doesn’t really change anything.” UNESCO has labeled more than 500 activities and traditions as cultural heritage, but it has never rescinded the honor, making the next steps uncertain. Aalst, northwest of Brussels, has long been known for its Carnival celebrations. But in its annual parade early this year, one float carried two giant figures of Orthodox Jews with side curls and grotesquely large noses, along with rats and bags of money.  Another Carnival group dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan — in order, they said, to satirize a far-right city councilor in a nearby town. Images of the event quickly spread, leading to accusations of bigotry and historical ignorance. Some critics began an international campaign to push UNESCO, the United Nations cultural organization, to withdraw its official recognition of the Aalst Carnival, one of Europe’s largest. The controversy was nothing new for Aalst. In 2013, a group of people took part in the Carnival parade wearing Nazi SS uniforms, marching alongside a float evoking the trains that ferried Jews to their deaths and carrying what appeared to be cans of the poison gas used in death camps. In anticipation of the 2020 carnival, hats adorned with side curls and hooked noses are for sale in the city. There is no established procedure for removing an item from the UNESCO list, Jorijn Neyrinck, an expert on intangible heritage and a member of the Flemish UNESCO commission, told a Belgian newspaper. On the other hand, there is no procedure for leaving the list voluntarily either. Mr. D’Haese, the mayor, said that a decision to remove Aalst would be politicized, and he predicted that the matter would not receive a fair hearing. “We’ve about had it in Aalst with the fact that we are being painted as anti-Semitic or racist on the international stage,” he said on a talk show on Belgian television on Monday night. “We don’t want to be the stage for a racist or anti-Semitic debate about a folk festival that connects people.” Two Dutch actresses, Carice van Houten and Halina Reijn, who were supposed to take part in the same talk show, canceled their appearances, citing the Carnival’s anti-Semitism. Aalst’s parade, which takes place on the Sunday before Lent, is the pinnacle of a three-day feast. It was added to UNESCO’s list in 2010. UNIA, an independent antidiscrimination group in Belgium, investigated the dispute. “We decided that the float was anti-Semitic,” said Bram Sebrechts, a spokesman for UNIA. But he said the group had concluded that the float did not violate the law because its specific goal was not to spread anti-Semitic beliefs, nor was it meant to incite violence against Jews. “You have to look at it in the specific context of Carnival,” he said. During Carnival, he said, “norms and values are turned on their heads.” He said that members of the Carnival committee had visited a Holocaust museum this fall, while a delegation of Jewish Belgians went to the Carnival museum. It went well, he said, adding that the parties were “on speaking terms.” André Gantman, a Jewish city councilman in Antwerp who belongs to the same political party as Mr. D’Haese, said that the resemblance between the parade float and 1930s Nazi imagery of Jews was eerily similar. “No lessons have been learned from history,” said Mr. Gantman, whose grandfather died in Auschwitz. Mr. D’Haese said on Monday night that the dispute was in part about whether the authorities should be allowed to regulate humor. “I have respect for what happened historically,” he said, adding, “In this discussion, context is everything.”']","As the United Nations agency considers whether to rescind the cultural heritage designation, a city’s mayor has tried to renounce the honor."
Prince Andrew’s Accuser Takes Her Case to the BBC,2019-12-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Virginia Roberts Giuffre recalled a whirlwind trip to London with her employer, the financier Jeffrey Epstein, when she was 17. It began at a townhouse where Prince Andrew was talking about his ex-wife, the Duchess of York. It moved on to a club, where she said she and the prince danced, and he sweated profusely. And it ended when, she said, she was ordered to have sex with him. “It was disgusting,” Ms. Giuffre said in an interview broadcast Monday by the BBC. “I sat there in bed and felt horrified and ashamed.” “I had just been abused by a member of the royal family,” she continued. “These powerful people were my chains.” Ms. Giuffre’s account of the trip in 2001, and of two other incidents when she said she had sex with Prince Andrew at Mr. Epstein’s homes in New York and in the Caribbean, was the first time she described her story for a British audience.  It is likely to deepen the scandal surrounding the ties between Mr. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in August, and Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II. The interview did not break new ground in the allegations against Prince Andrew, which are contained in legal documents. But it put a face to the woman who has accused a member of the royal family of being involved with sexual trafficking. And it drew another flood of revulsion from the British public, many of whom posted their reactions on social media.  Prince Andrew has denied the allegations, saying in his own recent BBC interview that he had no recollection of meeting Ms. Giuffre. “I’m calling B.S. on this,” she said. “He knows what happened. I know what happened. There’s only one of us telling the truth, and I know it’s me.” Ms. Giuffre acknowledged that the passage of time may have fogged her memory about the dates or places of certain events. But she said she had a vivid memory of dancing with Prince Andrew. “He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life,” she said. “His sweat was like, ‘it’s raining everywhere.’” For Prince Andrew, whose public career has already been ended by the scandal, the interview may be most significant because it underscores his potential legal exposure in the criminal cases involving Mr. Epstein. The BBC program, Panorama, reported that David Boies, a lawyer representing five women who say they were abused by Mr. Epstein, plans to serve subpoenas to force Prince Andrew to testify as a witness in those cases. “One of the things we have tried is to interview Prince Andrew and to try to get what his explanation is,” Mr. Boies said. “He was a frequent visitor. They ought to submit to an interview. They ought to talk about it.” Ms. Giuffre’s interview was a bookend of sorts to an interview Prince Andrew gave last month. In denying that he had sex with her, the prince offered as an alibi that he had taken one of his daughters to a pizza restaurant in suburban London on a night in March 2001 when she says they had the encounter. He said her memory of him sweating on a dance floor could not have been accurate because he suffered from a medical condition, dating back to his combat duty in the Falklands War, that made it impossible for him to perspire at that time. Prince Andrew evinced little sympathy for the victims of Mr. Epstein’s predatory behavior in the interview. He said he had stayed with his friend at his Manhattan mansion, even after Mr. Epstein had served prison time for soliciting a minor for prostitution, because it was “convenient.” The reaction to Prince Andrew’s remarks was swift and overwhelmingly negative. Several charities with which he was associated distanced themselves from him, he was urged to testify under oath to the F.B.I. and his brother, Prince Charles, urged the queen to strip him of his public duties, which she did. For the royal family, it was the worst public relations debacle since the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana in a car crash — stirring questions about the aging queen’s control over her family and drawing calls from the British news media for Prince Charles to take a more central role at Buckingham Palace. For Ms. Giuffre, who described a history of abuse dating back to her childhood, the alleged encounters with Prince Andrew left her, she said, even more sickened than those with Mr. Epstein, whom she described as “having a sickness that could not be cured,” or with his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of procuring teenage girls for him, and who Ms. Giuffre described as vicious. “This is not some sordid sex story; this a story of being trafficked,” she said. “This is a story of your guys’ royalty.”']","For the first time, Virginia Roberts Giuffre told a British television audience about a trip she took to London in 2001, during which, she says, she was ordered to have sex with Prince Andrew."
"With Internal Squabbling on Vivid Display, What’s Next for NATO?",2019-12-04,By Steven Erlanger and David E. Sanger,"['LONDON — When President Trump left the NATO gathering early and in a huff on Wednesday, it only reinforced the fear that with America distracted and retreating, the West’s celebrated alliance has lost focus.  The 70th anniversary celebrations in London largely illuminated NATO’s uncertainty about whether its primary mission is defending against a disruptive Russia, a threatening Iran, a rising China, or reconfiguring its strategy to deal with an array of new cyber and disinformation threats that it has been slow to confront.  And NATO’s own internal divisions were on vivid display, from Turkey’s disruptive role to the question of whether Europe needs its own defense — independent of the United States — alongside or in competition with NATO.  Mr. Trump, as he often does, focused more on warning member countries that while they have spent $130 billion since 2016, they must do more to share the burden. Whenever he alluded to strategy, it was usually to deflect the focus from containing or confronting Russia.  Everyone else was haunted by President Emmanuel Macron of France’s comment a few weeks ago that “what we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,” a statement he insisted he stood by, even though Mr. Trump, in a turnaround, accused him of insulting the alliance. For many, Mr. Macron is right. And what he is really talking about, they say, is the lack of coherent American backing — always NATO’s ultimate source of power — beginning in the White House.  “The single biggest challenge is absence of U.S. presidential leadership,’’ said Douglas Lute, a retired army general who served as American ambassador to NATO until 2017. That absence, he said, was a first “in NATO history, which inhibits progress on all other challenges.’’ Mr. Trump eased his critique on this visit, saying that while he had been right to call NATO “obsolete” in the past, the alliance has been revived by his success in pressing countries to spend more on their own defense.  Mr. Macron pushed back, turning the subject to the threats that NATO faces. It was a topic that Mr. Trump did not appear prepared to address, and his flustered response only reinforced the notion among critics that the American president had spent far more time thinking about cutting the cost of the alliance than the threats it must address.  Ian Lesser, a former American official who directs the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, said that the subtext of Mr. Macron’s criticism of NATO was growing doubt that Washington would aid a European ally under physical or digital attack.  “When he says ‘brain death,’ he’s talking about American leadership,’’ Mr. Lesser said. “That’s perhaps what Trump is hearing. Trump’s view is that he’s turned NATO around, and the rhetoric from Paris is compromising that narrative.’’ Jeremy Shapiro, a former American official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said some leaders assume that NATO will “brush aside this latest scare” because it has survived crises before. But he said the problems are real. Mr. Macron, he said, “not unjustifiably, sees Trump as turning his back on Europe and wants NATO member states, and the E.U., to wake up to this reality.’’ On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again dodged a clear commitment to NATO’s core belief of collective defense when asked directly if the United States would aid a member under attack — the key commitment in the alliance’s charter. Instead, Mr. Trump talked about military spending, persisting in his mistaken idea that member states who are not yet paying two percent of their gross domestic product on the military somehow “owe” the United States arrears. “If the alliance is to survive, and maintain its standing as a credible option for Western defense, it will require a new type of bargain — one that prices in American indifference, and that makes up the shortfall with greater European-level contributions and authority,” Mr. Shapiro said. But there is no consensus on the path forward. Mr. Trump’s possible impeachment also is an issue for NATO. At the core of the inquiry is the accusation that Mr. Trump traded a tenet of the alliance — helping a fragile nonmember, Ukraine, stave off Russian invaders — to benefit his own re-election campaign.  His reluctance to name Russia as the offender in the 2016 elections, combined with NATO’s confusion about the new era of cyber and disinformation threats, has prevented the alliance from leading the way with a unified response to the 21st-century attacks eating at democracies. Here are some of the main challenges facing NATO’s 29 members. Mr. Trump likes President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and the two met on Wednesday for a session that was not on Mr. Trump’s public agenda. But Turkey has refused to abandon a sophisticated air defense system provided by Russia — a threat to the newest American-made aircraft — and has made clear he wants one foot in both camps.  Turkey is a vital member of the alliance, bordering Syria, within striking range of Russia (which is why the United States still keeps nuclear weapons at a Turkish air base). Everyone except Mr. Trump was acknowledging that keeping Turkey fully committed to NATO is getting harder.  Mr. Macron also challenged Turkey’s definition of terrorists. Turkey regards the Kurdish forces on the Syrian border as terrorists, even when they fight the Islamic State alongside the United States, France and other NATO members. He essentially was asking how long Turkey can play both sides — a question Mr. Trump refused to address. “Turkey has increasingly become a challenge for NATO,’’ said Amanda Sloat, a former American official now at the Brookings Institution. Turkey is strategically located, has the alliance’s second largest military, hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees, and has legitimate security concerns, she said.  At the same time, fellow NATO members are questioning Turkey’s commitment. Still, Ms. Sloat said, there is no mechanism to expel Turkey and no desire to push it away from the West toward Moscow. This was the first NATO meeting where leaders seemed to take the threat of a rising China as a direct challenge. But it was a muddled discussion.  While Russia may be a disrupter on the edges of Europe, China is a builder. For the first time it has a noticeable naval presence in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Nordic sea routes. It is laying undersea fiber-optic cable, meaning more NATO nations will be communicating over Chinese infrastructure. And those platforms will pave the way for artificial intelligence applications and quantum computing — two areas where China is investing heavily, often in partnership with European universities.  But the immediate issue is driven by aggressive bids by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, to build 5G — “Fifth Generation” — switching systems in NATO countries, from Italy to Germany to Britain. Early this year Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was warning European nations that if they buy from Huawei, the United States might terminate their access to intelligence.  The reaction against Washington’s ultimatum was so sharp that Mr. Pompeo toned it down. Now several European countries are arguing they can “manage” China’s presence in their communication networks, a bid to avoid so angering Beijing that it retaliates by cutting European imports. Inside NATO, however, officials are struggling to understand what happens if its day-to-day communications run through Chinese switching systems and cell-tower networks — a vulnerability China could exploit in a conflict.  Mr. Trump waffled on the 5G issue on Wednesday.   “Well, I’m not working very hard on that,’’ he told reporters, a sharp change from the administration’s focus on the issue earlier this year. “Everybody I’ve spoken to is not going to go forward but how many countries can I speak to?”  (In fact, several appear to be going forward.) The French president sees a leadership vacuum in Europe that he wants to fill. Angry about Mr. Trump’s unpredictability and seeing him as a harbinger of a disengaged America, Mr. Macron is arguing for more “strategic autonomy” for Europe, including the ability to defend itself.  But many in NATO, including Germany, Poland and the nations of the Baltics and Central Europe, say Europe cannot deter Russia without the United States and its nuclear umbrella. They are also troubled by Mr. Macron’s claim that terrorism, not Russia or China, is the main threat to NATO, and by his outreach to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.  “If we want to build peace in Europe, to rebuild European strategic autonomy, we need to reconsider our position with Russia,” Mr. Macron declared in the same interview in which he diagnosed NATO’s brain. Poland’s foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, even suggested that France is “the Trojan horse of Russia.’’  As for European strategic autonomy, few believe that Europeans would spend the huge amounts necessary to be credible. Some think that France would be even less dependable than the United States in defending a small NATO member like Montenegro or Estonia. American policymakers should not worry too much, argued James Dobbins, a former American official now at the RAND Corporation. “Experience suggests that such initiatives will not get very far,’’ he wrote. “But more important, it would be good, not bad, for the United States if these efforts succeeded. The United States would welcome a more equal partnership with a more united Europe, distant though that prospect may be.’’ At the end of the London meeting, the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, still managed to present the appearance of unity. The final declaration recommitted the alliance to collective defense and its spending goals, and Mr. Macron got agreement on a new study of NATO’s future strategy, termed in NATO-speak, “a forward-looking reflection process,’’ under Mr. Stoltenberg, “to further strengthen NATO’s political dimension including consultation.’’ Steven Erlanger reported from London, and David E. Sanger from Washington. ']","The alliance might not be suffering “brain death” but it faces new technologies, new rivals, new weapons and a changing America. "
French Strikes Are a Fresh Test for Macron,2019-12-04,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron is facing his biggest test since the “Yellow Vest” uprising shook his presidency a year ago, as unions representing railway and transportation workers and many others in the public sector called for a mass walkout on Thursday to protest changes to France’s uniquely generous pension system. The strike began to unfold on Wednesday evening as workers at the national railway SNCF walked off the job. The walkout threatens to paralyze France for several days or more, with teachers, students, hospital employees, police officers, garbage collectors, truck drivers and airline workers all expected to join. By Thursday morning, the strike was taking hold across the country: Public transit was highly limited if nonexistent in many areas, most notably in Paris; stores and banks were boarded up; truck drivers were engaged in a slowdown; airlines canceled flights; and the police were preparing for hundreds of protests. The fresh round of social unrest is once again calling into question Mr. Macron’s top-down management style, a big factor in last year’s protest over stagnating wages and dwindling living standards. He promised then to bring more voices into his decision-making but has wound up dictating another overhaul that has created deep unease in France.  There is also now concern at the top at the reaction from the street, with one senior official at the Élysée Palace, the French presidency, acknowledging that the pension overhaul had the potential to galvanize disparate parts of the opposition. “Pension reforms create anxiety. It’s not an easy sell,” said the official, who could only be quoted anonymously under French rules. The Yellow Vests say they will join the new protest — unlike the unions, they have been successful at extracting concessions from the government — as will Mr. Macron’s opponents, right and left, and a wide spectrum of unions, though not the centrist French Democratic Confederation of Labor.  Publicly, government officials have been busy assuring journalists and others that they are not afraid of the strike action, which has come to be called “the Dec. 5 wall.” But the walkout and the underlying social discontent call into question Mr. Macron’s apparent triumph over the Yellow Vest movement, seen up until now as a crucial moment of his reformist presidency. Unions are predicting a huge turnout on Thursday. Jean Garrigues, a political historian at the University of Orléans, said, “The victory doesn’t seem to have rehabilitated Macron.” This week’s protest is “the reflection of a crisis in French society, one that can explode at any moment,” he added. “There’s real anxiety over the future.” Mr. Macron’s hasty $19 billion check to bolster purchasing power in the form of tax cuts and income supplements for low earners did help tamp down the Yellow Vest demonstrations. But some analysts, like the economist Daniel Cohen of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, have pointed out that the cash did not settle underlying French social dislocation linked to globalization. The senior Élysée official acknowledged that citizens were in effect saying that they had not seen enough improvement to their daily lives. The strike has been called to protest Mr. Macron’s proposed overhaul of the byzantine French pension system, one of the world’s most complicated and generous, which is currently headed for a deficit of about $19 billion. Some railway workers, for instance, can retire at 52, and average retirement ages are among the lowest in the industrialized world. The official retirement age is 62, but many retire before. Pensions as a percentage of working-age salaries are among the world’s highest, hovering at around 70 percent, and often even higher for state workers. Retirements tend to be long in France, and public leisure facilities — concerts, museums, theaters — are often full of vigorous retirees with lots of time on their hands. The results of this complex system of 42 different pension plans are remarkable: France has among the world’s lowest old-age poverty rates, and average incomes of those over 65 are slightly higher than incomes under that age, a global rarity. The train workers have their own retirement plan, as do the opera workers, the workers at the Comédie-Française — the national theater company — and the workers at the Port of Bordeaux, among others. Most workers are under the private-sector pension plan, in which the state is also heavily involved. The French are fiercely protective of their world-beating pension arrangements, and indeed, the government does not dare tinker with the basics: It is not proposing to spend less on pensions or to make people retire later. Instead, Mr. Macron’s idea is to merge all these disparate systems, public and private, into one state-managed system in which workers accumulate points over the course of a working life and then cash them in. His instinct is always to rationalize and he says his system will be fairer, though there are concerns that his changes will mean less for some. Hervé Boulhol, a pensions specialist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that, as things stand, “We’ve got a panorama that’s extremely disparate, with lots of different rules.” Mr. Macron is proposing “a very ambitious reform,” Mr. Boulhol said. “We’re changing the way of calculating pension rights.” But although many in France worship the rational, it is also a country that loves street protest and hates change, particularly in a moment full of fear over globalization and climate change. Previous governments have foundered on the third rail of French politics, the pensions system. “It’s not right that you do the same work, and your neighbor retires earlier, the calculation is different,” Mr. Macron said at a public meeting in Rodez in central France this fall. “So this has created suspicion in regard to our pension system, so today people find that it is more or less unfair, and more and more, people have doubts about it.” But they appear to have even more doubts about Mr. Macron’s changes. “The amount of pension, for everybody, is going to go down,” said Benoît Martin, a senior official with the General Confederation of Labor, a left-leaning union that is leading the charge on Thursday. He added, “The number of retirees is going to go up, but they’re not talking about spending more on pensions.” “It’s going to be a lot more haphazard, this way of getting points,” Mr. Martin said. “When there’s periods of little work, the number of points will be low.” None of this is certain. But one of the difficulties with Mr. Macron’s overhaul is its continual state of flux, and the president’s own lack of clarity. At Rodez, Mr. Macron refused to commit to special retirement rules for the police; sure enough, they will be demonstrating on Thursday.  “We don’t know all the details; there’s uncertainty,” said Mr. Boulhol of the O.E.C.D. There was talk, for instance, of raising the retirement age, but a vast outcry killed that idea. And then there has been the government’s uncertain method, which could point to lessons imperfectly learned from the Yellow Vest crisis. Mr. Macron was “scarred” by those protests, he had a “consciousness-raising,” said Ismaël Emelien, one of the president’s closest advisers until he left the government this year and who is still a source of counsel. Mr. Macron learned that “all change has got to be cultural,” Mr. Emelien said in an interview this fall. “You’ve got to implicate society in these changes. You can’t just stand there and say you are right.”  The senior Élysée official said: “We have to associate the people. It’s a matter of management and focus.” And so Mr. Macron spent four months traveling France to listen and to lecture, a process that continues fitfully today. But in the end, the pensions overhaul has been served up like so many of its predecessors, under the French top-down system: from the professed smart folk at the Élysée Palace. There has so far been no debate in Parliament. Mr. Macron has convened endless meetings with unions, but those discussions have not made the lines move. “We have the impression that these meetings were not really a negotiation,” said Mr. Garrigues, the political historian. “The positions remained fixed. And the responsibility for this immobility belongs to an executive too used to top-down. Maybe that’s the personality of Emmanuel Macron.”']","The walkout by a broad range of workers threatens to paralyze France for several days, calling into question the president’s apparent quelling of the “Yellow Vest” movement.

Zelensky’s Opponents Fear He Is Ready to Capitulate to Russia,2019-12-05,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['KYIV, Ukraine — Washington may be obsessed with the impeachment inquiry over President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, but it was far from the minds of a few thousand protesters who gathered on a recent frosty night in Kyiv to vent their anger at their own country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, over his peace overtures to Russia. If he struggled to resist demands by Mr. Trump for investigations affecting next year’s United States elections, some protesters said, imagine what will happen when he meets President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday for talks on ending the war in eastern Ukraine. As speakers derided Mr. Zelensky as soft on Russia, the crowd answered with cries of “No to capitulation!” and “Treason!” Mr. Zelensky campaigned for the presidency on a two-plank platform of fighting corruption and ending a grinding war with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 13,000 people.  While the peace effort has received less notice, it is undoubtedly the more politically treacherous of the two undertakings. Everyone is against corruption, in theory at least, but there are sharp divides over how to deal with Russia, which is widely despised by Ukrainians outside the breakaway eastern territories. Domestic political opponents are concerned that Mr. Zelensky, having no clear American diplomatic backing, may be too willing to make concessions to Moscow in the talks. Any widespread perception that he has done so could weaken him politically, hampering his ability to follow through with his anticorruption efforts. “If the president signs anything granting Russian influence in Ukraine, it would cause riots,” said Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament in the party of former President Petro O. Poroshenko, which is in opposition to Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Ariev said that the talks with the Trump administration over opening investigations related to the family of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “were unprofessional, and that is why we are concerned about what will come” in talks with Russia. Already, the critics say, Mr. Zelensky has made unilateral concessions intended to pave the way for the peace talks. And they are alarmed at comments by Ihor Kolomoisky, a businessman with ties to Mr. Zelensky, suggesting that Ukraine should swivel toward Russia amid the chaos in Ukraine policy in the United States. In the worst-case scenario, they say, Mr. Zelensky would give amnesty to rebel leaders and grant sweeping autonomy to the breakaway regions, while allowing Russian forces to linger in or just outside Ukraine even after any political settlement. In the peace talks, scheduled for Monday in Paris, most analysts see Russia seeking at a minimum to trade de facto control over the two separatists zones in eastern Ukraine for influence in domestic Ukrainian politics, including a veto on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In its post-independence history, Ukraine has twice tilted from pro-Western to pro-Russian governments, in 1994 and 2010. It’s a back-and-forth common to many former Soviet states as they have tried to play the powerful east-west geopolitical forces off against each other for advantage at home. In Ukraine’s case, on both occasions the country lurched back into the Western orbit, most recently in the Maidan revolution of 2014. In recent years, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova have all at some point pivoted to closer ties with Russia — and then back, in some cases. In an interview, Mr. Kolomoisky said that Ukraine should do just that if America tries to pressure Kyiv again.  Analysts saw the comments as self-serving, in that Mr. Kolomoisky stands to lose billions of dollars under a banking sector overhaul backed by Western governments. Mr. Zelensky issued a statement distancing himself from the comment. Working as an actor in Moscow in 2014 as Russian troops invaded his country, Mr. Zelensky joked that Russian soldiers were not moving inside Ukraine, but were “just standing on the border, and the Ukrainian border is just slightly pushed forward.” But through the summer, Mr. Zelensky sought a White House visit to urge Mr. Trump to press Russia and side with Ukraine in the negotiations. It never materialized.  To the contrary, at a news conference in New York in September, Mr. Trump backed away from Mr. Zelensky and his troubles in the war, telling the Ukrainian leader, “I really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.” By distancing himself from Mr. Zelensky in the negotiations, as stressed by many of the security professionals who testified in the recent impeachment hearings, Mr. Trump has raised doubts about how far he will go to support Ukraine and made it harder for the Ukrainian government to defend the concessions it is making to end the war.  Some analysts say that despite Mr. Zelensky’s weak hand going into the talks, worries of a pivot to Russia are overblown and mostly whipped up by domestic political opponents. “Accommodation with Russia would be a very hard sell inside Ukraine,” Steven Pifer, a former United States ambassador to Ukraine, said in a telephone interview. Ivan Yakovina, a foreign policy columnist with Novoye Vremya magazine, concurred, saying that allies of Mr. Poroshenko, the former president, were fanning fears of a geopolitical pivot to undermine Mr. Zelensky. “They don’t think he is worthy of being president,” Mr. Yakovina said of Mr. Zelensky, who before his election as Ukraine’s leader played a president in a television series. They see him “as a clown from a television show. They are doing everything so he fails.”  To pave the way for talks, Mr. Zelensky rebuilt a bridge across the de facto border with the breakaway republics, pulled troops back from the front line in three locations, negotiated a prisoner exchange and agreed to the outlines of a political formula for an eventual settlement. Mr. Zelensky has said that each step was worthwhile in its own right. He secured the return of Ukrainian captives, eased hardship for people living in separatist areas and ended some of the senseless skirmishing along the front.  In the settlement road map signed in early October, Mr. Zelensky agreed to a timeline for local elections and to other political steps needed to reintegrate the breakaway regions with Ukraine without any corresponding timeline for Russia to withdraw its troops. Mr. Zelensky says the Russian troop withdrawal is implied. Three protests ensued on Independence Square — the largest of which drew about 20,000 people, far fewer than the gigantic crowds that gathered on the square in the 2014 revolution and drove the pro-Russian leader Viktor F. Yanukovych into exile in Moscow. “There are clear red lines that Ukrainian society, and especially the active part of Ukrainian society, is not willing to cross and not willing to let anybody cross, including the leaders of the country and the president,” said Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, the leader of the opposition Holos political party. Mr. Vakarchuk pointed to polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians oppose a settlement on terms of the so-called Minsk agreements, the framework deal under which Mr. Zelensky will negotiate in Paris.  Under 20 percent of Ukrainians support the political framework that Mr. Zelensky is pursuing, about 25 percent want to continue fighting to free the separatists territory, and about 35 percent want to declare the regions as occupied by Russia but not pursue military efforts to recover them for now, according to a poll by Rating Group, which conducts social surveys.  Mr. Vakarchuk says he is consulting with Mr. Zelensky’s party in Parliament and would support any agreement that emerges from the Paris talks if it defends Ukrainian interests.  That will be harder to pull off with America distracted, though. “For a long time, the United States was considered the leader of the free world, and I think that was fair enough,” Mr. Vakarchuk said. “But remember the Bob Dylan song — ‘The Times They Are a-Changin’.’” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting. ']",The Ukrainian president’s political opponents worry that the Trump impeachment inquiry may have weakened Ukraine’s position before peace talks in Paris next week. 
"Portrait of London Bridge Killer, in His Own Words",2019-12-05,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON —\xa0“I have learnt that many of my past beliefs came from my misinterpretations of Islam,” the young man wrote to his probation officers. “There were many gaps in my knowledge but now I am on new path and am learning to become a good Muslim. I would like a chance to prove to you that I will not cause harm to nobody in our society.” Last Friday, the man who wrote those words, 28-year-old Usman Khan, traveled unsupervised from his probation hostel in England’s West Midlands to London, where he carried out a deadly terrorist attack after having participated in a conference on prison rehabilitation. A week after the attack, questions remain about why he was allowed to travel by himself to the conference and, more broadly, about Britain’s rehabilitation system and the process of releasing convicted terrorists back into society. On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that 74 people who had been jailed for terrorism offenses and released early would have their license conditions reviewed, and he vowed that serious offenders would no longer obtain early release.  But interviews with people familiar with Mr. Khan’s history — and copies of letters and reports on his progress written by Mr. Khan and obtained from officials with the government’s counterterrorism Prevent Program and the probation service — show that the problems of rehabilitating radical jihadis are complex, and do not always lend themselves to simple solutions like longer prison terms. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, because investigations into the attack are underway. Mr. Khan clearly engaged in a long-term effort to con the British authorities. Before being released from jail last December, halfway through a 16-year sentence for his involvement in a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange, he took every opportunity to convince his parole officer and the Home Office that he was a changed man. For years, he wrote letters from jail assuring officials that he no longer embraced radical Islamic ideology and felt deep remorse about his membership in a Qaeda-inspired cell that had planned to carry out attacks in Britain. In one letter to the Home Office, dated Oct. 15, 2012, soon after his incarceration, he requested placement in a deradicalization course.  “I would like to prove to the authorities, my family and society in general that I don’t carry the views I had before my arrest,” he wrote, “and also I can prove that at the time I was immature and now I am much more mature and want to live my life as a good Muslim and also a good citizen of Britain.”  Later that year, he was enrolled in the Healthy Identity Intervention Program, the government’s main vehicle for dealing with people convicted of offenses linked to terrorism. While enrolled in that course, he wrote long reports about his putative progress and repeatedly asked for a chance to prove that he was no longer a threat. A probation service official familiar with Mr. Khan’s case said that he carried out an elaborate deception of all the agencies that had been monitoring him. The official insisted that nothing in his behavior suggested he would do anything improper, let alone the terrible attack he pulled off. Before the attack, Mr. Khan was under active surveillance by the MI5 domestic intelligence agency, which had set his level of threat to the public as “low to medium.” He had the highest level of security measures applied to his parole, according to an internal probation report. The probation official said that Mr. Khan would have to have shown significant progress to be allowed to attend the conference.  He displayed those feigned signs of progress on the morning of the conference, when he spoke about his rehabilitation efforts — a “compelling success story,” as one conference participant described it. But during a break in the conference program, the BBC reported, Mr. Khan disappeared into a bathroom and re-emerged wearing a fake suicide vest with two large knives taped to his hands — it is unclear how he got the weapons into the building.  He then set off on a rampage across the grand Fishmongers’ Hall venue, where he killed two recent Cambridge University graduates who were attending the conference and injured three other people before being tackled down by members of the public, including other rehabilitated offenders attending the conference, and shot dead by the police. Mr. Khan’s case demonstrates the difficult challenge of distinguishing impostors from those who have truly had a change of heart and mind. The Prevent official, a former extremist himself, was shocked to learn that Mr. Khan had been allowed to travel to London alone. He said the extremists who plan the attacks are master manipulators who learn the tricks of the game in prison. They have to be watched constantly, he said, until you have absolute proof that they have changed.  Mr. Khan’s path to radicalization started at the age of 14, when he became active in Britain’s homegrown extremist network, Al Muhajiroun, regularly participating in their provocative public preaching events and demonstrations.  At 16, he became a student of Anjem Choudary, a radical Muslim preacher who this year was released from a probation hostel to home arrest after serving time in prison for inciting support fort the Islamic State. While most Al Muhajiroun members abide by a “covenant of security” that forbids attacks on non-Muslims in members’ country of residence, some senior activists maintain that individuals have a choice whether to accept it. Mr. Khan clearly did not.  In 2010, at 19, Mr. Khan came to the attention of the security services after joining a group of eight extremists inspired by Al Qaeda and started discussing plans to carry out bomb attacks across British cities and build training facilities for militants. He was convicted of terrorism offenses in 2012 and served eight years in prison. Since his release, Mr. Khan had been living in a probation hostel in Staffordshire, a county known for its quaint villages and historic market towns.  He was required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet that allowed the police to track his movements, the probation service official said. Restrictions were applied to his phone and internet usage, he was barred from meeting associates and was required to meet with a probation officer at least twice a week. The probation official declined to comment on the assessment that allowed Mr. Khan to travel unaccompanied to London last Friday, saying that it was under investigation. But he reiterated that Mr. Khan had shown no signs that aroused suspicion or concern. Mr. Khan was also placed in the government’s secretive Desistance and Disengagement Program, which was introduced in 2016 as a more holistic approach to rehabilitation, with support that includes mentoring, psychological counseling, and theological and ideological advice. That approach has been applied to British jihadi fighters returning from Syria and Iraq. Experts say it is too soon to say whether its methods have been effective, though Mr. Khan hardly provides a basis for optimism.  The Prevent official said that deradicalization required time, patience and expert counseling to understand the extremists’ narrative, background and state of mind, and then to convince them of the flaws in their thinking. “It is much easier to deceive people when you do not fear death,” the official said. “I’m sure Usman was genuinely in good spirits when he left the hostel and traveled to London, because in his world he was about to be set free as a martyr.”']","The extremist behind last week’s London Bridge attack wrote letters to the authorities from jail, claiming that he was on a “new path” and was “learning to become a good Muslim.”"
Tensions Overshadow NATO Meeting Intended as Show of Unity,2019-12-04,By The New York Times,"['This briefing has ended. For more on the meetings, you can read about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s candid comments caught on video as well as an analysis of President Trump’s turnabout on NATO. President Trump abandoned plans on Wednesday for a news conference that was scheduled after the NATO meeting, saying that he had already spent ample time talking to the media. He left shortly after the end of his last meeting declining to take the opportunity of summarizing the day’s events, as most leaders did. Mr. Trump made the announcement on Twitter after calling Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada “two-faced” while speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Earlier, a brief video had surfaced that showed a small group of NATO leaders at Buckingham Palace reception expressing dismay about Mr. Trump’s behavior. “Honestly, with Trudeau, he’s a very nice guy,” Mr. Trump said when asked about the Canadian leader, in comments that were among the starkest to date of how the relationship between the two North American neighbors has weakened since Mr. Trump took office. “The truth is, I called him out on the fact that he’s not paying 2 percent and he’s not very happy about it,” said Mr. Trump, who spoke to reporters at length twice on Tuesday, referring to Canada’s financial contributions to NATO. The president tried to make light of his remarks in a comment caught as reporters were being ushered from the room.  “That was funny when I said that guy was two-faced,” he said, referring to Mr. Trudeau. The video was posted overnight, and in it Mr. Trudeau is heard commiserating with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain about Mr. Trump’s conduct on the first day of the two-day NATO gathering. Princess Anne, the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, and Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands are also standing with the group. In the video, Mr. Johnson turns to the French leader with a grin and asks, “Is that why you were late?” It was unclear exactly what preceded the question. Mr. Trudeau then says to the group, “He was late because he takes a 40-minute news conference at the top,” an apparent reference to one of Mr. Trump’s long exchanges with reporters on Tuesday. “You just watch his team’s jaws drop to the floor,” Mr. Trudeau says at another point. Mr. Macron cannot be heard, but is seen speaking and gesturing animatedly.  The world leaders, who appear to be unaware that they are being recorded, do not mention Mr. Trump by name, potentially giving them a mote of deniability about appearing to mock a powerful but unpredictable partner.  Mr. Trudeau, speaking during a press briefing after the meeting, said the relationship between the United States and Canada remained strong. “I have a very good relationship with President Trump and his team,” he said when asked about the video.  He also attempted to explain away the “jaws drop” comment, saying it was a response to an unplanned announcement that the upcoming Group of 7 summit meeting would be held at Camp David.  Mr. Trudeau is one of a handful of leaders who have seen their initial cordial relationships with Mr. Trump grow cold, including Mr. Macron, who held an particularly tense news conference with his American counterpart on Tuesday. When Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, spoke before the meetings on Wednesday, he acknowledged the external and internal pressures facing the alliance but insisted that it was agile and strong enough to deal with them. Speaking outside the Grove Hotel in Watford, England, Mr. Stoltenberg laid out an ambitious agenda for the leaders from North America and Europe: the international fight against terrorism, arms control, combating Russia, and, for the first time, the rise of China. But NATO is not only facing emerging superpowers outside the alliance: It also has deep internal divisions and disputes that were on clear display throughout the two-day event. Mr. Stoltenberg said that differences among the heads of the alliance’s member states were nothing new, citing disputes over the Suez crisis of 1956 and more recently the war in Iraq. “There’s always been differences,” he said. “What we have proven and what we also show today is NATO is able to overcome these differences.” Speaking again later in the day, Mr. Stoltenberg said the group of 29 nations had reaffirmed their commitment to collective defense and made way for “unprecedented burden sharing,” despite their differences. “Politicians they are very often criticized for being very good on rhetoric and bad on substance. In NATO, it’s in some ways the opposite,” he said. “The rhetoric is not always excellent, but the substance is perfect.” Despite all the squabbling and political one-upmanship, NATO leaders and their teams did manage to pull together a final declaration that does show alliance solidarity.  And it has a little something for everyone. It restates the alliance’s commitment to collective defense — part of its founding treaty of 1949 — and more recent spending goals. The declaration talked about new and continuing threats from Russia, China, terrorism, new technologies and nuclear weapons. And it supports a study about NATO’s future — “a forward-looking reflection process” intended “to further strengthen NATO’s political dimension including consultation.” However awkwardly phrased, that is NATO’s response to the French diagnosis of “brain death.” Widespread anxiety prevailed in the run-up to NATO’s celebration of its 70th anniversary that President Trump, whose criticism of the alliance as obsolete is well-known, would upend the meeting with a surprise demand or an insult of an ally, as he has done before.  But Mr. Trump found himself in the unusual position of defending NATO after an uproar created by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who told The Economist last month that NATO was suffering “brain death” because of what he described as an absence of American leadership under Mr. Trump.  In a meeting on Tuesday morning with NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, Mr. Trump called Mr. Macron’s comments “very insulting” and a “very, very nasty statement essentially to 28 countries.”  Later, in a meeting with Mr. Macron at the American ambassador’s residence in London, the French leader put Mr. Trump on the defensive not only about his vision for NATO, but also about his handling of a military conflict involving Turkey, the quandary about what to do with captured foreign Islamic State fighters in Syria and a trade dispute between France and the United States. Mr. Macron was unapologetic. In a Twitter posting later, he acknowledged that his comments had provoked reactions, but said that “we need to be clear about the foundations of NATO. Tomorrow, I will defend the interests of France and Europe.” As he arrived for Wednesday’s meeting, Mr. Macron was again asked about his “brain death” comment, and stood by it. “In fact it allowed us to raise some crucial debates,” he said.   “I think it was our responsibility to raise ambiguities that could be harmful, and to tackle a real strategic debate,” he added. “It has started, I am satisfied.” The White House said President Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the “security of our telecommunication networks” and the need to “guard against untrusted providers,” on Tuesday evening, shedding a little more light on their closed-door meeting at 10 Downing Street. The United States has put heavy pressure on Britain to block the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from gaining access to its 5G network because it fears that China will use such access to spy on Western countries. Mr. Johnson postponed a decision on Huawei until after the general election, in part to avoid opening a rift with the Trump administration at a time when he hopes to begin negotiating a trade agreement with Mr. Trump if, and when, Britain leaves the European Union. The White House said the leaders also talked about trade, though it offered no details. Mr. Johnson has urged Mr. Trump to steer clear of politically charged topics during his two-day visit, and the president has so far largely complied. The White House readout fell back on the time-tested diplomatic formulation that the leaders “again reaffirmed the importance of the Special Relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States.” On Wednesday, Mr. Trump took an uncharacteristically reserved approach upon his arrival for the meeting, tweeting just once before the gathering and offering friendly words for Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson’s political future is on the line in a parliamentary election on Dec. 12, and in the run-up to the vote, the Conservative prime minister has sought to keep the president at arm’s length. In past visits, Mr. Trump has made his hosts uncomfortable with no-holds-barred assessments of the state of British politics, and he has both praised Mr. Johnson and disparaged his main opponent, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. But this time, he has shown a degree of restraint, refraining from commenting, in news conferences or on Twitter, about the election or the competitors. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the host of the NATO summit, but he spoke like he was walking on eggshells when he faced reporters at the end of it, most conspicuously on the politically fraught topic of President Trump. Mr. Johnson dodged repeated questions about his dealings with Mr. Trump, whom he met at 10 Downing Street on Tuesday evening, and managed to get through the entire session without uttering his name. The prime minister claimed ignorance of a widely circulated video shot at a reception in which he, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada were caught appearing to mock Mr. Trump for long-winded remarks to reporters during the meeting. And he ducked a question on whether Britain planned to restrict the access of Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant, to its 5G network, which the White House said that Mr. Trump had pressed him to do. Asked whether Mr. Trump was good for NATO or for Britain, Mr. Johnson answered by paying tribute to the Trump administration’s decision to expel 60 Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain, after the Russian government poisoned two people with a nerve agent on British soil in 2018. “This was under the current American administration,” Mr. Johnson said. “They were shoulder to shoulder with us and could not be more supportive.” By contrast, the prime minister, who faces British voters in eight days, leapt at a chance to pivot to domestic politics. He accused his Labour Party opponents of seeking to undermine NATO, dismantle the MI5 security service, and subject Britons to a “Groundhog Day” of referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence. President Trump, whose administration has threatened to raise tariffs on French goods in retaliation for France’s tax on tech companies like Google and Amazon, will find a similar target for his ire in Britain. Britain is scheduled to begin imposing its own tax on the revenues of technology companies in April. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, campaigning in Salisbury on Tuesday ahead of the country’s general election next week, said he deplored Mr. Trump’s threats over trade and maintained that he would push for freer markets. He also appeared to want to push on with Britain’s plans. “I do think we need to look at the operations of the big digital companies and the huge revenues they make in the U.K. and the amount of tax they pay,” Mr. Johnson said, according to local media reports. “We need to sort that out. They need to make a fairer contribution.” Companies that run social media platforms, internet marketplaces and search engines will face a 2 percent tax rate on sales made in Britain. Currently they pay tax only on the profits they record in the country. When the new tax was announced in October 2018, the British government estimated that it would raise 1.5 billion pounds, or more than $1.9 billion, over four years. The tax was aimed squarely at global technology companies, said Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer at the time. “It is only right that these global giants with profitable businesses in the U.K. pay their fair share towards supporting our public services,” he said. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes Britain, France and the United States, has been working to reach a common position on taxing technology companies and other multinational businesses.

Measles Outbreak Leads to Shutdown of Public Services in Samoa,2019-12-03,By Elian Peltier,"['The government of Samoa is shutting down all public services for two days to fight a measles outbreak that has killed 60 people and infected thousands of others in the South Pacific island nation over the past two months. Nearly 3,900 cases of measles have been reported in the country, whose population is just 200,000. Schools have been shuttered since the government declared the outbreak a national emergency last month.  The shutdown, which will take place on Thursday and Friday, comes amid a resurgence of measles in dozens of countries in recent years, including in the United States, the Philippines, the Democratic Republic of Congo and some European countries.  In Samoa, where vaccination rates are low, more than 150 new cases of infection were disclosed on Monday alone. Most of the victims in the country, which is part of the same island chain as American Samoa, have been babies and children under 4. The Samoan government said this week that half of the 29,000 most vulnerable children — those age 6 months to 4 years — had yet to be vaccinated. As in numerous other countries, officials have struggled to stanch mistrust about vaccinations. In Samoa’s case, the health authorities say that many people became wary when two babies died last year after being given vaccines that had been erroneously mixed with an expired muscle relaxant instead of water.  Although the measles vaccination rate among infants in the country was as high as 90 percent in 2013, according to the World Health Organization, by last year it had plummeted to 31 percent. Vaccinations were made mandatory for everyone in Samoa last month, and the authorities are now trying to accelerate the nationwide immunization campaign.  “Our children and people will never become immune to any future epidemic unless we have almost 100 percent vaccination coverage,” Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said during a visit to hospitals on Monday. “It’s the only antidote.” Mobile clinics have reached remote villages and rural areas in recent weeks, and over 110,000 people in Samoa have been vaccinated since early October, according to government figures.  As part of the shutdown this week, no vehicles were allowed on the roads, and Samoans were asked to wait at home for vaccination units to arrive. Schools had already been closed under the national emergency, and children were barred from public gatherings.  The country’s hospitals are ill equipped to handle the crisis: The World Health Organization and UNICEF estimate that the country’s main hospital alone needs at least 180 additional nurses to fight the measles outbreak. “These hospitals aren’t designed to deal with this,” Scott Wilson, a doctor from New Zealand who has assisted health workers in Samoa, told The Associated Press. He estimated that Samoa’s hospitals were running at “200 and 300 percent capacity.” Despite the government’s vaccination efforts, many in the country have turned to traditional healers, according to news reports. The authorities in New Zealand, which once ruled Samoa and which is home to a large Samoan diaspora, said that the first case of measles in a recent outbreak in New Zealand had come from the Philippines, and that the disease had then moved to Samoa.  New Zealand’s director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, told the national broadcaster RNZ that the authorities were “also seeing the odd case now coming back into New Zealand from Samoa.”']",Dozens of people have died and thousands more have been infected in the country since the disease began spreading in October.
Jewish Graves Desecrated in Historic French Cemetery,2019-12-04,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Dozens of graves in the Jewish cemetery in the small Alsatian village of Westhoffen have been found daubed with swastikas and anti-Semitic graffiti, the latest in a series of cemetery and synagogue profanations in the region. The historic cemetery, which dates to the 16th century and houses the graves of the families of Karl Marx and former French prime ministers Léon Blum and Michel Debré, is the third Jewish cemetery in Alsace to be desecrated in the last year, according to the authorities.  The police discovered the desecrated Westhoffen graves — about 107 of them — on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the French interior minister visited, vowing to redouble efforts to find the perpetrators.  There have been more than 50 incidents this year of school and village walls and cemeteries scrawled with anti-Semitic graffiti in the region, officials said. “It raises questions,’’ the rabbi for the region, Harold Avraham Weill, said in an interview on Wednesday night. “All these incidents, and no one has seen anything?” “There is a silence, a deaf-and-dumbness in the population,” he said. “There are no eyewitnesses. Nobody has seen or heard anything. We are obligated to ask questions.’’ The village of Westhoffen no longer has a Jewish community, though the Jewish population in Strasbourg, 25 miles to the east, numbers about 20,000 and is growing, Mr. Weill said. “This is what astonishes me,” said Maurice Dahan, president of the Jewish community of the Bas-Rhin department, where Westhoffen is located. “These cemeteries are inside the villages. So I ask myself the question, all those people I saw at the windows yesterday, and nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything? It’s not possible that people never see anything.” Neither faulted the police inquiry, which is continuing, but both said the police were stumped by a lack of witnesses. Last February, 96 graves in Quatzenheim were discovered scrawled with swastikas, and almost exactly a year ago tombs at Herrlisheim were found similarly desecrated. On Wednesday, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner visited Westhoffen and promised to create a “National anti-hate office” within the national police, to help coordinate the investigation into this and similar incidents. “Hate has struck, hate is here, on our land,” Mr. Castaner said. The perpetrators had left indications that they would strike the Westhoffen cemetery, according to Mr. Dahan, twice scrawling on nearby village walls in recent days the words “Cim juif Westhoffen,” meaning “Westhoffen Jewish cem.” “I think these people who do this are well-organized, even if they are imbeciles,” he said. “They don’t make too many mistakes.” Jean-Louis Debré, former president of France’s Constitutional Council, who visited the cemetery with Mr. Castaner on Wednesday, and whose family is buried there, said: “I’m not forgetting that 10 members of my family did not come back from Auschwitz.”']",It was the latest in a series of anti-Semitic incidents in the region.
"Iran Used Firearms in Deadly Crackdown on Protesters, Officials Admit",2019-12-03,By Farnaz Fassihi and Megan Specia,"['Two weeks after protests gripped Iran — and quickly turned deadly — the government has acknowledged that security officers used firearms to quell the widespread demonstrations but  it has denied unofficial accounts that hundreds were killed.  Iran’s state television confirmed on Monday night that security forces had shot and killed protesters who had taken refuge in marshes in the southern city of Mahshahr. It described them as “armed terrorists” and praised the tactics of security forces for having crushed the unrest.  “Enemy cells were hiding in the marshes and shooting at security forces,” Col. Reza Papi, a police commander in Mahshahr, told the state television broadcast.   The comments were among the first admissions by the Iranian authorities that security officers had responded to the demonstrations with lethal force.  Iranian officials on Tuesday also denounced accounts of the death toll that have emerged since the protests began, saying that the number of victims was much lower but not specifying how many. Witnesses and residents in Mahshahr, in southern Iran’s Khuzestan province, earlier had told The New York Times that dozens of men had been gunned down in the marshes and that most of them had been unarmed, except for one who did fire a shot at the security forces after they had opened fire on the men at a nearby checkpoint. Between 180 and 450 people are believed to have been killed in the four days of violence that convulsed cities around the country when demonstrators gathered on the streets to protest a gasoline price increase announced on Nov. 15. In that same period, at least 2,000 others were injured and another 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists. Press TV, one of Iran’s state-run news outlets, on Tuesday quoted Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, a spokesman for Iran’s judiciary, as saying that the estimated casualty figures were false.  “The numbers and figures that are being provided by hostile groups are utter fabrication, and the actual figures are fewer than what these sources claim,” Mr. Esmaili said, according to the news outlet. He did not offer any official figures. At the same time, reports also surfaced of new strife — an indication that the government’s earlier assertion that the protests had ended was premature.  Press TV reported that dozens of arrests had been made in Khuzestan Province on Tuesday, citing intelligence officials.  Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency reported what appeared to have been a revenge killing of a security officer by an ethnic Arab resident of Shayegan, a working class city in Khuzestan. There were also reports of protests and clashes in the city of Sarbaz in southeast Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan Province, one of the largest in the country.  Sistan and Baluchistan, populated by mostly ethnic Baluch Iranians, borders Pakistan and has a history of popular armed uprisings against the central government. It also is home to Chahbahar port, a major shipping point developed by Indian contractors. Social media videos and accounts in Persian media like BBC Persian showed protesters blocking a major access road to the port and security forces armed with guns and tear gas opening fire at them. The Iranian authorities have provided little information about the extent of the protests since they began, and officials imposed a dayslong internet blackout during the crackdown that further limited the distribution of information on the violence.   They also have accused the Trump administration of encouraging the protests, singling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for inviting Iranians to share videos and other material purporting to document the crackdown.    President Trump, during a visit to Britain for a NATO meeting, on Tuesday weighed in on the protests, suggesting without evidence that thousands had been killed. “Iran is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak,” he said, a statement vastly different from other estimates. “That is why they cut off the internet, so people can’t see what is going on.”  Political analysts said evidence of a continuing repression of protesters in Khuzestan, Sistan and Baluchistan and in the western province of Kurdistan —  all with ethnic minorities and separatist movements —  could lead to a cycle of reprisals and more violence.   Some said they also had no doubt that the central authorities in Tehran would respond with overwhelming firepower if necessary to send a message to the United States and Iran’s regional adversaries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Israel. “The rapid resort to brute force was aimed at demonstrating to the U.S. that the leadership in Tehran will nip any social upheaval in the bud at any cost,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group. “They now believe they have successfully proven to Washington that not only they are powerful in the region, but they are also in total control at home.”  ']","The government said security forces had fought back against “enemy cells” as demonstrations swept the country, but it said the death toll had been exaggerated.

U.N. Asks for Record Funds for Aid Programs,2019-12-04,By Nick Cumming-Bruce,"['GENEVA — The United Nations appealed on Wednesday for nearly $30 billion for humanitarian relief operations in 2020 to aid people whose lives are disrupted by armed conflicts, economic desperation and the effects of climate change. As many as 168 million people may require aid in 2020, Mark Lowcock, the United Nations aid coordinator said. That would be the largest number of people in need of humanitarian relief since World War II, Mr. Lowcock said as he launched an appeal to finance relief operations next year.  Providing relief is not only more expensive than ever, but it is also more dangerous for those providing the aid. In the first nine months of this year, 171 people working at health centers and medical facilities were killed, Mr. Lowcock said, compared with 131 aid workers who were killed in all of 2018. The request by Mr. Lowcock’s agency, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, is about $1.5 billion more than it requested a year ago.  As a barometer of the world’s humanitarian crises, the annual appeal underscored the inability of powerful nations in the deeply polarized United Nations Security Council to curb long-running conflicts or to confront climate-related disasters. The unfolding crisis in Venezuela accounts for the sharpest increase in anticipated humanitarian aid costs, the United Nations said, most of it to be earmarked for assistance to the 4.5 million Venezuelans who have fled the country. About half of the total aid requested for 2020 is being budgeted for just three countries afflicted by ruinous wars that have dragged on for years. Yemen remains the site of the world’s most disastrous humanitarian crisis, despite some easing of the conflict in recent months. The agency estimates that 24 million people in Yemen will continue to need the assistance of aid agencies to battle acute hunger and outbreaks of disease. Syria is another of the international trouble spots that will continue to require major investments in aid next year, according to the United Nations. After nine years of civil war, more than five million Syrian refugees have fled the country and an additional six million people have been displaced inside Syria. The Democratic Republic of Congo is the third nation that will require major relief efforts. Armed groups that attacked health workers fighting an Ebola epidemic provide a glimpse of the violence that has driven more than five million people from their homes.']","Citing wars and the effects of climate change that have produced a flood of refugees, the agency is seeking nearly $30 billion for humanitarian relief in 2020."
"To Make Sense of Lebanon’s Protests, Follow the Garbage",2019-12-03,By Vivian Yee and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — In Lebanon, its people like to boast, you can take in pristine mountain villages and swim in the shimmering sea all in one day.  But the country’s blond-sand beaches are now scarred with plastic bottles and its mountain streams befouled by open dumps. The Mediterranean gurgles with toxic runoff from rotting garbage. A seemingly unstoppable proliferation of trash has marred Lebanon’s water, seafood and public health. The government’s inability to provide basic services, including 24-hour electricity and garbage collection, is rooted in an agreement that ended Lebanon’s civil war nearly 30 years ago. The deal divided power between the nation’s 18 recognized religious sects, effectively institutionalizing corruption, with each group able to dole out government jobs, contracts, favors and social services to its followers.  The Lebanese have finally had enough of a system that has enriched the political elite while failing to build a stable economy or provide basics like reliable running water or consistent waste management. Over the last six weeks, hundreds of thousands of protesters have massed in the streets, chanting “Give back the looted money!”  They have already forced out the prime minister, but their goals are broader: They are demanding an end to corruption and mismanagement, as well as the crony sectarianism that enables it. The perpetual garbage crisis is only the most pungent example. It last exploded into public view in 2015, when the country’s political elite squabbled over a lucrative waste-management contract as mountains of uncollected trash fouled the streets of Beirut. A wave of protests ensued.  The stopgap solution was to build two new landfills. Three years after they opened, the landfills have only relocated the garbage crisis to the coast, and they are fast threatening to hit capacity. The $288 million contract for one landfill went to Jihad al-Arab, the brother of an aide to the recently ousted prime minister, Saad Hariri, a Sunni Muslim. According to three people familiar with the company’s operations, it is adding water to the garbage containers that arrive each day to inflate their billable weight. The other contract, worth $142 million, went to Dany Khoury, a Christian businessman said to be close to the family of President Michel Aoun, Lebanon’s top Christian leader. At this landfill, experts found, employees dumped trash and toxic waste directly into the Mediterranean. Both companies deny the accusations, but one thing is certain: At least $430 million later, Lebanon’s garbage issues are little closer to resolution. “Garbage,” said Paula Yacoubian, an independent member of Parliament who has repeatedly questioned how public money has been spent on electricity and infrastructure projects, “is like a gold mine for the political caste.” The issue is not limited to garbage — nor to a few politicians. When a controversial resort called Eden Bay swallowed part of Beirut’s last public beach last year, many Lebanese were not surprised to learn that the developer was a former son-in-law of Nabih Berri, the speaker of Parliament and the top Shiite in government. A major reason that Lebanon does not produce enough electricity for its four million people, experts say, is the powerful lobby of generator owners, whose machines provide power during daily blackouts, as well as the $1.2 billion-a-year diesel industry that fuels them. One of the major fuel importers, Cogico, is owned by Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the Druze minority. When Gebran Bassil, the son-in-law of President Aoun, pushed to buy extra electricity from Turkish power barges anchored just offshore, some officials asked why the government was spending hundreds of millions of dollars to rent the barges instead of building its own plants. Some politicians said that a government official had received millions of dollars in kickbacks, but they did not publicly identify the person and nothing was ever proved. Five years later, the energy minister, a former adviser to Mr. Bassil, proposed paying the same Turkish company $1.9 billion for more power, in a bidding process the government’s own procurement department criticized as biased. “It’s a pity to have such leaders,” said Abdo Farah, a fisherman who has trawled the waters around Beirut for 34 years, pushing farther out in search of clean fish as sewage, industrial runoff and garbage soiled the coast unchecked. “We’re living in a trash can.” Much of the sectarian deal-making takes place at the Council for Development and Reconstruction, the opaque government agency that awards contracts for most of Lebanon’s major infrastructure projects. The contracts are usually paid for with the billions Lebanon has received in aid from the World Bank, European countries and other international donors for postwar reconstruction and development.  The council’s procurement rules are “notoriously lax,” the United States Embassy in Beirut reported in a February 2009 State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. The Lebanon manager for the World Bank at the time, Demba Ba, told American diplomats that he was “constantly fighting C.D.R.’s declarations that it ‘already has a contractor’ for projects,” the cable said, “usually someone either associated with the P.M. or whom the P.M. needs to compensate for a political or financial favor.” The council has been run for years by Nabil el-Jisr, a longtime former employee and ally of the Hariri family. But its board also includes a Christian, a Druze and a Shiite who happens to be a brother of Mr. Berri, the Parliament speaker.  Hospitals, roads, schools and other projects are distributed to favored contractors according to sectarian quotas that ensure every group benefits, regardless of necessity, said Jad Chaaban, an economist at the American University of Beirut who has analyzed the council’s spending. “They’ll tell you, ‘Well, we had to balance it in a sectarian way because we can’t only build schools in mostly Sunni areas, we also have to do Christian areas,’” he said. “They hide behind sectarianism to fund their patronage networks and their cronies.” Sectarian connections determine not only government contracts but access to coveted government jobs, schools, bureaucratic favors and, occasionally, social services. A system meant to foster peaceful coexistence has only reinforced sectarian divisions, making most Lebanese dependent on the good graces of their sects’ leaders — and each sect more determined to fight for every government dollar and favor. So it was no surprise when, in 2016, the Council for Development and Reconstruction turned to Mr. Khoury, the Christian businessman linked to Mr. Aoun, and to Mr. al-Arab, the Sunni Muslim contractor linked to Mr. Hariri, to help solve Lebanon’s garbage emergency.  Mr. Khoury took over an old landfill at Bourj Hammoud, north of Beirut, with plans to expand it into the sea. Najat Saliba, a chemist at the American University of Beirut who inspected the site in 2017, found that Mr. Khoury’s company was dumping trash into the landfill without sorting it, despite a contractual requirement that recyclables be separated and hazardous material be removed.  Moreover, she found, the landfill’s breakwaters in the Mediterranean were not keeping the trash out of the water. Garbage and the toxic liquid oozing from it were going straight into the sea. The contractor has said that it was not sorting the garbage because doing so would delay the project. It told Dr. Saliba that the sea had been polluted by sewage and other runoff, not by the landfill. A lawyer for Mr. Khoury, Mark Habka, said last week that all standards were now being met. Mr. al-Arab opened a new landfill at Costa Brava, and two sorting plants. But workers at the sorting plants have made little attempt to sort much of what arrived, according to three people familiar with their operations.  They also said that they had seen workers using hoses to add water to the garbage before weighing it, increasing the cost to the government.  The three people include two who visited the sorting operation in 2017 and a third person familiar with the plants’ current operations who confirmed that these methods persist. These people asked not to be identified, fearing physical harm for speaking out. Representatives of Mr. al-Arab’s company, Al Jihad for Commerce and Contracting, contacted this November,  insisted that all the trash was sorted properly. But internal plant data from July 2018 shows that 93 percent of the waste was being dumped into landfills. Hisham Karameh, Al Jihad’s waste management director, denied that the company played any tricks with the weighing, saying the weighing was monitored by representatives from the company, the government, the municipality and outside consultants.  Despite such questions, the development council has repeatedly fattened Al Jihad’s contract, agreeing in a series of add-ons to pay the company an additional $161 million to upgrade and expand the operation, without opening the process to new bids. Mr. Karameh insisted the process was fair. “What we’ve won, we’ve won fairly,” he said. “Every businessman in Lebanon is related to someone in politics.” Both Al Jihad and the council said the company had submitted the lowest bid for the original contract. While businessmen and politicians have grown richer, the trash crisis has only grown harder to ignore. “Money from all these donating governments has been wasted in pretending to do these constructive reform projects,” Dr. Saliba said. “And nothing’s been happening.” By last summer, Costa Brava’s neighbors had had enough. Local residents blocked garbage trucks from entering, calling on the government to produce a sustainable solution. “It seems like the dumping will only stop after the trash reaches Cyprus,” said Ziad Haidar, the mayor of Choueifat, a nearby municipality. “But what can we do? If we kept blocking the road, you’d see trash everywhere on the streets.” For several years, the government has promoted incineration as a long-term solution, despite objections from environmentalists and scientists.

Strikes Against Macron’s Pension Plans Shut Down Much of France,2019-12-05,By The New York Times,"['A protest against changes to France’s pension system brought parts of the country to a grinding halt on Thursday, with nationwide strikes shutting down transportation and leaving schools and hospitals unstaffed and basic government services unmet.  Huge crowds of railway workers, teachers, students, hospital workers and other protesters peacefully marched down Paris’s wide boulevard Magenta, and amid blaring loudspeakers and occasional firecrackers, commuters struggled to find ways to get to work. Subways were largely shut, children left for school early and only about one in eight suburban trains were running in many areas, if they were running at all. Though officials and protest organizers gave conflicting figures, the demonstrations were some of the largest in recent years. The festive mood in Paris gave way to a more tense one as the day wore on, and sporadic violence broke out, especially near the Place de la République. Some violent protesters burned vehicles and threw projectiles at the police there, and officers fired tear gas and charged the group. There were also reports of isolated standoffs in other cities, including in Bordeaux, where security forces also fired tear gas. Throughout the country, workers stayed home to register opposition to the proposed changes pushed by President Emmanuel Macron. The widespread participation in the strike suggested deep social discontent, creating a new test for the government after its largely successful efforts to tamp down last year’s “Yellow Vest” protests.  “They are changing the rules mid-game, said Christine D., a 52-year-old schoolteacher who was protesting and declined to give her last name. “They don’t communicate enough with the people.” “He is completely out to lunch,” she added of Mr. Macron. One protest chant called for Mr. Macron’s early retirement later this month, when he turns 42. The government deployed thousands of additional police officers in Paris alone to prepare for potential violence. Stores and banks were boarded up, especially along the route of the main demonstration in Paris, in anticipation of action by “casseurs,” or “breakers,” who have caused havoc in previous protests. In Paris, the police announced that officers had carried out 9,350 “preventive checks” and 71 people had been arrested by 3:30 p.m. The checks were widely used by the police during the Yellow Vest rallies to keep those suspected of violent activism from reaching protest areas, a tactic that has also been criticized for infringing upon the right to demonstrate. Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the General Confederation of Labour, one of the unions opposed to the pension plans, said his group would not back down until the overhaul was scrapped, calling instead for an improvement of the current system. “Either you listen, or you continue to be stubborn the way the president has been since he was elected,” Mr. Martinez told reporters at the start of the Paris demonstration. “There is no reason to abandon a system that the whole world is envious of.” President Emmanuel Macron is “calm and determined” in the face of Thursday’s strike, though he is concerned about disruptions to daily life, a senior official at the Élysée Palace, the French presidency, told reporters at a news briefing. Mr. Macron is “watchful that public order be respected, watchful as to the difficulties for French people, and watchful also that the right to strike is respected,” said the aide, who spoke anonymously in line with French government rules. But the aide underlined the president’s determination to see his pension overhaul through.  The aide was also at pains to dismiss the idea that Mr. Macron had cut himself off from ordinary citizens over the changes. The president has yet to make a comprehensive address explaining his ideas, and his critics say he is out of touch.  The government has also been sensitive to the notion that the pension overhaul is complicated and difficult to understand. Mr. Macron wants to get rid of France’s 42 different retirement schemes and replace them with one program managed by the state. “No doubt the reform is complex,” the aide said. “But it’s a commitment he’s made.” France has one of the world’s most generous pension systems, and past efforts to change it have long proven perilous in French politics. But President Emmanuel Macron is pushing ahead, hoping to streamline a byzantine system of 42 different pension plans that collectively are headed toward a $19 billion deficit. Mr. Macron proposed merging the various plans, public and private, into one state-managed system, in which workers would accumulate points throughout their careers and then cash them in. He has promoted the idea as a fairer system, but some are concerned that they would be left with lower payouts.  One protester, Philippe Lauberthe, 47, who works at the railway company SNCF, said the proposed changes were “a race to the bottom for our pensions.” He said that a point-based system was risky for workers, since it was not clear how much points would be worth at retirement. “Finance is governing,” said Ludovic Varlet, 52, a hospital worker from Dourdan at the Paris protest. “It was the best system in the world, and they are about to destroy it.” For some, the demonstrations brought to mind protests in 1995 against attempts to overhaul pensions and other social services. Millions protested in November and December of that year, and strikes paralyzed the country for three weeks until the government backed down. But Mr. Macron’s government has tried to dispel any notion that 2019 will prove similar, noting that in 1995, the changes were not part of President Jacques Chirac’s electoral platform — unlike Mr. Macron’s — and that major unions and other groups had not been consulted. This time, the government has been discussing the project with labor unions, though the groups have expressed frustration with the lack of specifics. As often happens after major demonstrations in France, Thursday ended with a battle over attendance estimates. The Interior Ministry said on Thursday evening that more than 800,000 people had demonstrated around France, whereas the CGT, the largest labor union opposed to the pension reforms, said the figure was 1.5 million. In Paris, the police said 65,000 people had demonstrated, versus 250,000 for the CGT. After night had fallen, protesters were still filing into the Place de la Nation, the end point of the march. Either way, that makes the demonstrations some of the largest in recent years. The strikes will mostly continue on Friday and the following week, and some Yellow Vest protesters have called to demonstrate on Saturday. Most metro lines in Paris will remain closed on Friday, and 7 of 10 high-speed trains, as well as 7 of 10 express regional trains will be canceled across the country. The protests have drawn comparisons with the Yellow Vest demonstrations of 2018 that ultimately forced Mr. Macron to make concessions over fuel prices and government subsidies.  The strikes are not directly tied to last year’s protests, which channeled deeper discontent with economic inequality into a movement that brought tens of thousands into the streets. But many Yellow Vest activists have joined the new action, as have a wide spectrum of unions and political parties. Many of those marching in cities across France on Thursday wore the fluorescent vests now ubiquitous among the group. Ingrid Levavasseur, a nurse and well-known Yellow Vest activist, said she hoped the general strike would bring momentum back to the movement.  “The government is still not listening to us, but they can’t go against the people’s opinion,” Ms. Levavasseur said from her home in Louviers, in northern France. “If the government keeps ignoring our demands, this will go much further than one day of protests.” As thousands of protesters marched in eastern Paris, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe acknowledged that train traffic had been “very impacted” by the strike and that the government expected disruption again Friday. Mr. Philippe told reporters that despite scattered violent faceoffs between “breakers who had not come to protest” and that “demonstrations went fine pretty much everywhere in France.” But getting to work on Thursday morning was especially challenging for residents of Paris, where all but a few metro lines were completely shut down, and many buses remained idle in their depots. At 9 a.m. at the Trocadéro station, the metro entrance was closed. Confusion reigned as commuters checked whether the No. 9 line was up and running. (It was, but only during rush hours, and only on a limited stretch that did not include that station.) El-Kabir Abdoulhamid, 37, looked at the map on his smartphone and concluded: 25 minutes by foot. He had already taken a packed commuter train from the suburb of Evry, and his full journey would be at least 30 minutes longer than usual. “But I support their right to strike,’’ said Mr. Abdoulhamid, who works in banking. “It’ll force employers to reflect.”  Châtelet, a major metro hub and station for regional trains, was empty by late morning, and virtually all the stores inside were closed. A screen displayed all lines to the outer suburbs of Paris as being on strike, as well as most Paris metro lines. A scattering of security guards and cleaners working in the giant shopping mall Les Halles, which is connected to the station, said they had woken up earlier than usual to take trains in from the suburbs. “I can’t afford not to work,” said one cleaner who would only give his first name, Manu, as he washed the floor in front of an empty escalator. He said he was employed on minimum wage for a cleaning company subcontracted by the mall. “I know people are striking over pensions, but it makes things a lot harder.” The Gare de Lyon, a major hub in eastern Paris that has an elegant clock tower and from where trains leave for cities such as Lyon and Marseille, was nearly empty. One traveler, Alexandra, 28, who declined to give her last name, was trying not to fall asleep, bundled up in a scarf to ward off the biting cold. She said she was waiting for a train to visit family in Lyon, but it had been canceled, and she now had to wait several hours for the next one. While she felt concerned by pension changes, she said, she disagreed with the strike. “It’s inconvenient,” she said, adding that for tourists, like those on their way to see the famed festival of lights in Lyon, “It gives a bad image of France.” But when people strike in France, Alexandra said, “they don’t do it halfway.”  Along the normally bustling Rue St.-Denis in central Paris, almost every store was shuttered. At one clinic, only a handful of patients and doctors milled about. Most doctors had canceled appointments for the next two days, and the waiting room was nearly empty. Diego Piemental, 34, a manager at a nearby hair salon, gestured to his only client on Thursday afternoon. His bookings had fallen by more than half, he said. “It’s close to a holiday, when business is normally up,” he said. “And if the shops remain closed, tourists won’t come here, so that will mean even fewer clients.” With a large number of employees taking part in the protests,  the Musée d’Orsay and the Eiffel Tower were also closed. The Louvre was open, though visitors were not able to see all of the collections, and the Palace of Versailles was recommending that visitors reschedule for a later date. The Trocadéro Esplanade, which provides the best vantage point to photograph the tower, is normally packed with tourists, but on Thursday there were only a few. “You can see for yourself, it’s empty,’’ said one annoyed vendor, one of only four selling plastic replicas of the tower and other trinkets. “It’s noon — usually this place is packed with tourists,’’ said Zehar Chakri, 31, whose family owns a tourist kiosk, Souvenir de Paris, in front of the esplanade. “We haven’t sold anything today. I hope the strike doesn’t last beyond this weekend. December is usually our best month.’’ Deniz Uras, 27, a Paris-based Turkish guide, had brought two clients from Turkey to the esplanade. They had been forced to cancel plans to move on to Amsterdam. “They’re stuck, and they don’t understand why,” Mr. Uras said. “I’ve been here for 10 years, so I know striking is in the French culture.’’ Officials in tourism and in some French cities have expressed worries about the effect of the general strike. Already, officials in Lyon and Strasbourg have reported widespread cancellations by nervous tourists.

Australia Revokes Medical Evacuations for Offshore Detainees,2019-12-04,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The Australian Parliament on Wednesday repealed a law that had allowed refugees and asylum seekers being held offshore to seek emergency medical care in Australia, a reversal that human rights advocates denounced as cruel and shameful. The vote, which came 10 months after the law was enacted, was the latest example of the Australian government’s hard-line stance on border protection, a policy it has maintained even as the United Nations has condemned it for detaining asylum seekers who were intercepted at sea indefinitely, on islands in the Pacific. “This was always a law that was about getting people here through the back door, and today we’ve closed that back door,” Peter Dutton, the minister for home affairs, told reporters in Canberra, the capital. He added that it had undermined efforts to resettle refugees in the United States under a deal struck in 2016. The independent senator who cast the decisive vote to repeal the measure, Jacqui Lambie, said it would return decision-making power to lawmakers from doctors, whose approval was required for a medical transfer.  “You can take advice from doctors, but doctors aren’t elected. They aren’t accountable to the public,” Ms. Lambie told the Senate as the repeal passed, 37 to 35. Physicians’ groups had strongly supported the medical evacuation law, saying it upheld fundamental rights to health care. The law, which was narrowly approved in February after a campaign by doctors, lawyers and rights advocates, allowed detainees on the islands to come to Australia for medical treatment or assessment if the transfers were approved by two doctors and the home affairs minister.  About 170 people have filed applications to be transferred under the law, and more than 130 have been evacuated. About 500 are still being held in the Pacific island nations of Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Since the Australian government enacted a policy in 2013 barring anyone intercepted at sea from setting foot in Australia, more than 3,000 people have been held on the islands, where their living conditions have been described as dire. Twelve detainees have died since 2014. A coroner said in 2018 that a faster medical transfer could have prevented the death of Hamid Khazaei, an Iranian asylum seeker who suffered from a leg infection. There have been no deaths since the medical evacuation law was enacted. Dissenting lawmakers said the law’s repeal would compound the detainees’ despair. “The last shred of hope for people we know were suffering in those offshore hellholes was knowing they were getting medical care — and now that’s gone,” said Richard Di Natale, the leader of the Greens party. Detainees called the move a devastating blow. Shamindan Kanapathi, a Sri Lankan detainee in Papua New Guinea, said on Twitter that refugees’ lives would “again be in the hands of politicians who have shown they will deliberately withhold medical treatment from people who desperately need it.” Jana Favero, a director at the Asylum Seeker Resource Center, said that many of the people who had been evacuated suffered from multiple medical conditions, and that many more sick detainees remained. “This is not about left and right, it’s about right and wrong,” she said. “Yet again, the government is playing politics with people’s lives.” Ms. Lambie, the senator who cast the deciding vote, had initially expressed sympathy for the refugees’ plight but ultimately voted for the repeal, saying she had negotiated a secret agreement with the conservative government on the issue. The government denied any such deal. New Zealand has offered to help resolve the crisis by accepting 150 refugees a year, though the Australian government has so far refused the proposal.  On Wednesday, the Kurdish-Iranian writer Behrooz Boochani, a prominent former detainee, applied for asylum in New Zealand, Australian news media reported. Mr. Boochani was allowed to leave Papua New Guinea last month for a literary festival in New Zealand. Under a deal reached with President Barack Obama late in his second term, 654 refugees have been resettled in the United States, with 251 in the provisional approval stage, Mr. Dutton said. ']","The government called the policy, enacted just 10 months ago, a “back door” to let refugees into the country. Human rights advocates denounced the repeal as shameful."
Typhoon Kammuri Kills at Least 17 as It Powers Through Philippines,2019-12-03,By Jamie Tarabay,"['Typhoon Kammuri swept through the Philippines on Tuesday, ripping rooftops from houses, knocking down power lines and leaving a half-million people huddled in evacuation centers, waiting for the storm to pass. At least 17 people were killed. Manila’s international airport was closed for 12 hours during the storm, resulting in the cancellation of nearly 500 flights. Officials suspended marine traffic in affected areas as Kammuri, packing wind gusts as high as 150 miles per hour, battered the Philippine archipelago for a second day.  By early Wednesday the storm had weakened slightly, officials said, but heavy rainfall was expected to continue. Officials had feared that flooding could deluge Manila, the capital, and   its surrounding areas, home to more than 10 million people.  In Albay, a province in southeastern Luzon, the largest and most populous Philippine island, Gov. Al Francis Bichara said fierce winds had caused more damage than the rain. “Right now there’s no electricity, the cables had fallen, but it’s calm now,” he said, speaking to a Manila radio station. The army, the police force and emergency service workers were helping to clear roads of debris, said Claudio Yucot, a regional director for civil defense.  The 17 deaths reported Wednesday by emergency officials and the national police included a man who was electrocuted when a damaged wire touched his galvanized metal roof. Another man was hit by a tree and killed. A man who was fishing along the shore in Quezon, along the south of Luzon, was struck by lightning, and several others on shorelines along the archipelago drowned. Across the Philippines, officials said the evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people from exposed areas had lessened the impact of the storm on civilians and prevented more deaths.  Still, the authorities warned of storm surges up to three feet and floods and landslides from the wind and rain in the mountainous countryside. A sizable portion of the Philippine population lives along the coast and in low-lying areas, and the authorities issued flood alerts for several regions. They also warned that landslides set off by typhoon rains could affect more mountainous, rural areas.  The typhoon struck the Philippines as the nation hosted the Southeast Asian Games, a biennial sports event that draws top athletes from 11 Southeast Asian nations. The Games are scheduled to run through Dec. 11, and already several outdoor events have been canceled or postponed until later this week. Sports like windsurfing, beach volleyball and canoe-kayak racing were either suspended or postponed, while others were held ahead of the storm’s arrival.  Kammuri, known locally as Tisoy, is the 20th storm to hit the Philippines this year.

Trump Abruptly Exits NATO Gathering After Embarrassing Video Emerges,2019-12-04,By Annie Karni and Katie Rogers,"['LONDON — President Trump arrived in London Monday evening planning to tout a foreign policy accomplishment his presidential campaign wants him to run on: successfully pressuring allies to pay more toward the costs of running NATO. Less than 48 hours later — after he was put on the defensive in front of the cameras and then was the subject of gossip at a private reception of world leaders, a moment caught in a viral video — Mr. Trump canceled a planned news conference before heading back to Washington earlier than planned. [Politicians have a long history of being caught saying impolitic things. Let’s roll the tape.] The timing was not perfect. Mr. Trump had hoped the 70th anniversary celebration of NATO might provide a flattering stage and a triumphant narrative, even as Democrats on Capitol Hill on Wednesday trotted out sober legal scholars to testify at the House Judiciary Committee’s first public impeachment hearing. But instead of creating a split screen, Mr. Trump failed to produce the statesmanlike narrative his campaign had hoped for. The result was he appeared boxed in both at home and abroad, ultimately overshadowed by diplomatic dynamics that put him on his back foot. “We’ll go directly back,” Mr. Trump told reporters before a meeting on Wednesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as he surprised his aides by abruptly scrapping plans for a formal news conference. “I think we’ve answered plenty of questions.” Mr. Trump had, in fact, answered hours of scattershot questions from the news media by the time the gathering was over. But his quiet departure from Britain — without a splashy tabloid newspaper interview or a sit-down with a friendly television personality, or the set-piece final news conference he typically conducts when abroad — seemed to show an uncharacteristic admission of defeat. “The NATO declaration and meeting outcome was successful but all the political fireworks around the leaders’ meeting was not,” said Heather A. Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There simply was nothing else to say other than to continue to further complicate NATO political dynamics.” Mr. Trump arrived in London already something of a persona non grata. His political kindred spirit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, had made it clear he had no interest in any show of support from a president who is seen by many of Mr. Johnson’s supporters as radioactive. He warned Mr. Trump to stay out of the British election, set for Dec. 12.  But the dim view that many European leaders themselves hold of Mr. Trump later burst into public view by accident. A video surfaced that showed grinning world leaders at a Buckingham Palace reception on Tuesday night, apparently commiserating in what they thought was a private conversation about the unmanageable behavior of the American president. “He was late because he takes a 40-minute news conference at the top,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said to a small group that included President Emmanuel Macron of France, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, Mr. Johnson and Princess Anne. In the video, which was posted online by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Trudeau does not mention Mr. Trump by name. But later in the day, he acknowledged he had been discussing the American president.  “You just watch his team’s jaws drop to the floor,” Mr. Trudeau said at another point in the video, expressing astonishment at Mr. Trump’s behavior. Mr. Macron is also seen participating animatedly in the conversation, but his comments cannot be heard. Mr. Johnson is seen smiling. Princess Anne looks on. None of the world leaders seemed to realize the conversation was being recorded. But the video played directly into Mr. Trump’s own fixation with rival leaders laughing at him, or at the United States. By Wednesday afternoon, some of the participants were seeking to distance themselves from the perceived criticism of Mr. Trump. During a news conference, Mr. Johnson claimed ignorance of the widely circulated video. “I don’t know where that has come from,” he said. “I really don’t know what is being referred to there.”  Mr. Johnson even managed to get through the entire news conference without uttering Mr. Trump’s name. In the past, Mr. Trump has been loath to give up the spotlight, especially if he would be ceding it to a televised impeachment hearing unfolding on Capitol Hill. “President Trump has committed impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors by corruptly abusing the office of the presidency,” Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard University, testified on Wednesday in Washington as Mr. Trump was wrapping up the last of his meetings with European leaders abroad.  Mr. Feldman was one of three constitutional scholars invited by Democrats to testify at the hearing. All three said Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine for political gain met the historical definition of impeachable offenses. But Mr. Trump did not have a positive story to tell that would distract from the hearing. The narrative unfolding in London was of his soured relationships with foreign leaders. “He’s two-faced,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Trudeau, when asked about the viral video. He attributed Mr. Trudeau’s apparent frustration to the American leader’s pressure campaign to increase Canada’s military spending to 2 percent of its economic output. “He should be paying more than he’s paying,” Mr. Trump said. “I called him out on that, and I’m sure he wasn’t happy about it, but that’s the way it is.” Mr. Trump was already on the defensive after a 45-minute joint appearance on Tuesday with Mr. Macron, who arrived at the celebration fresh off an explosive interview with The Economist magazine, in which he said the loss of American leadership in Europe has led to “the brain death of NATO.”  During their news conference, the French president aggressively challenged Mr. Trump’s vision for NATO and broached tensions over Turkey’s incursion into Northern Syria, which Mr. Trump had helped facilitate. For Mr. Trump, it was a rare face-to-face meeting with another world leader in which he was not driving the conversation. Mr. Macron appeared to be relishing the role of the newly anointed disrupter-in-chief of NATO. But Mr. Trudeau tried to downplay the tension.  Although the Canadian prime minister admitted in a news conference that he was talking about Mr. Trump in the video, he said his “jaws drop” comment referred only to the surprise announcement that the upcoming Group of 7 summit would be held at Camp David, rather than as Mr. Trump had originally proposed at the Trump National Doral golf resort in Miami.  Mr. Trudeau added, “I have a very good relationship with President Trump and his team.” Mr. Trump seemed pleased with his own retort. “That was funny when I said that guy was two-faced,” Mr. Trump said, in a second hot-mic moment of the two-day gathering — a private exchange with another attendee at a luncheon for countries that had met a military spending benchmark required by NATO. Later in the day, the mood in a room where Mr. Trump was meeting with the Italian prime minister grew palpably tense as the president turned his focus to the Democratic-led impeachment effort back home, calling a report released by the House Intelligence Committee “a joke.” He said it was a “disgrace” that the hearing was taking place “on a day like this where we’re in England and some of the most powerful countries in the world are having very important NATO meetings.”  After calling Democrats “unpatriotic,” Mr. Trump also questioned whether Democrats “loved our country.”  Mr. Trump has long bridled at the thought that other world leaders might poke fun at the United States. Part of his 2016 presidential campaign pitch to voters was that his election would change how America was viewed abroad.  “The world is laughing at us,” he said frequently during the campaign, criticizing the leadership of President Barack Obama. In June 2017, when he announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, Mr. Trump said: “We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won’t be. They won’t be.” But in 2018, laughter broke out at the United Nations General Assembly when Mr. Trump claimed that his administration had “accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” The president insisted at the time that he was not the target, saying, “They weren’t laughing at me, they were laughing with me.” Mr. Trump left NATO with another positive gloss on an embarrassing meeting. “We had a really good day and a good day yesterday,” he said.

"Afghanistan Needs Billions in Aid Even After a Peace Deal, World Bank Says",2019-12-05,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — As the United States urgently pushes a peace deal with the Taliban to end its costly military presence in Afghanistan, the World Bank  has warned that the war-stricken country will still require billions of dollars in international aid over many years after a peace deal to deliver basic services and sustain any potential peace. Eighteen years of expensive American and NATO military presence marked by inefficient funneling of billions of dollars has shaped an economy almost entirely dependent on foreign aid. The country’s $11 billion in public expenditure each year is a far cry from its modest revenues, which even after recent improvements barely reach $2.5 billion, officials and analysts say. The difference, about 75 percent of expenses, is footed by grants from international partners, particularly the United States. A new World Bank report, titled “Financing Peace,” addresses the idea that American and other international donors to Afghanistan see a potential deal with the Taliban as what one official described as an “out of jail card” to significantly reduce their costs in Afghanistan, particularly on the civilian side. The report warns that even after a settlement with the Taliban the country would still require financial assistance at near current levels, as much as $7 billion a year for several years to come, to be able to sustain its most basic services. About half of Afghanistan’s public expenditure goes to a security force of around 300,000 members who are locked in an intensifying war with the Taliban. Officials do not expect the size of that force, too large for its own means, to shrink immediately after a peace deal; in fact, it would be likely to grow if part of a peace deal involved integrating Taliban fighters into the security forces.  Meanwhile, the most basic civilian services are already underfunded, with the economy growing at a slower pace than the rate of population growth. More than half of the population is considered below poverty line. That has become a national security concern, as support for the central government is tightly tied to the delivery of services — and that would be even more so immediately after a peace deal, with more people expecting an improvement in their lives when the war ends. “A sudden and substantial reduction in civilian grants would risk a reversal of the gains that have been achieved, driving increased hardship and poverty,” said Henry Kerali, the World Bank country director for Afghanistan. “While Afghanistan is not expected to be reliant on grants forever, the pace of decline in grant support needs to reflect current realities.”  When the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, there was little government infrastructure left after decades of conflict. The capacity to absorb the large amounts of money that came in — about $130 billion so far from the United States alone — was simply not there. Government corruption and a wasteful system of contracting and subcontracting, both inside Afghanistan and in Washington, created an inflated economy simply unrealistic for the means of the country. Even 18 years later, nearly half of the international aid is still spent not through the Afghan government, which donors say is still marred by corruption, but rather through contracts where a major slice is simply lost on layers of handoffs and the costs of expensive international consultants brought in on projects. Often, the Afghan government has little idea of how much money is being spent at a particular time around the country in its name, struggling to keep tally of all the contracts. Khaled Payenda, a former deputy finance minister of Afghanistan, said that donor fatigue was understandable considering the war had dragged on for 18 years.  “But for me, and for so many people who believe in better aid, it’s not the levels of assistance that are important, but rather how you spend the money,” said Mr. Payenda. “Five hundred million dollars from USAID could mean two or three big contracts to big U.S. subcontractors, or a lot of good work through the government’s budget.” The current cycle of financial commitments of international donors to Afghanistan, with just under $5 billion in security assistance each year and $3.5 billion in civilian aid, expires next year. The discussion around the future of aid is happening amid what one Western official called a “perfect storm” — the government in Kabul is locked in a messy re-election dispute and also disagrees with the United States over how peace talks with the Taliban should proceed. In the West, the conversation is more focused on Brexit and President Trump’s desire to reduce costs abroad as fulfilling a campaign pledge of refocusing domestically. Afghan and Western officials say that while there is little concern about European donors reducing aid, the United States government — the biggest donor to Afghanistan by far — has signaled to expect a significant reduction at least in civilian assistance in the next cycle. A State Department spokesman said a reduction in civilian aid has been a gradual process over the years, aligned with the American objective of assisting the Afghan government in expanding its “capacity and desire for greater self-reliance.” United States civilian assistance has dropped to $480 million in 2019, from $4 billion in 2010.  “Earlier this year, the U.S. embassy in Kabul led a review of all U.S. civilian assistance,” the spokesman said. “The review endorsed the present strategy and concluded that future requests for civilian assistance will continue to responsibly decrease as U.S. policy objectives are met in Afghanistan.”']",Analysts say that American hopes for a quick deal and then slashed spending could lead to a collapse after 18 years of international aid created an unsustainable economy.
Splintered Isle: A Journey Through Brexit Britain,2019-12-07,By Patrick Kingsley and Laetitia Vancon,"['SHIREBROOK, England — There used to be a mine at the edge of this small town near the center of England. Now there is only a warehouse. The mine provided coal that powered the country. The warehouse stores tracksuits. The mine meant a job for life. The warehouse offers mostly temporary work for the lowest legal wage. You work here, one worker told me in the drizzly parking lot last month, and you get treated like a monkey. Shirebrook was the third stop of a 900-mile journey I made through Britain last month. I was trying to make sense of a splintered country in the run-up to the Dec. 12 general election. The outside world typically sees Britain through the affluence and cosmopolitanism of London, but other than one quick stop there, I went elsewhere, looking for people beyond the capital’s glare. Everywhere I went, it felt as if the country were coming unbound. For all sorts of reasons, all sorts of people — Leavers and Remainers; blue- and white-collar; Jews and Muslims; English, Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh — felt alienated and unmoored. At times, I was reminded that electoral politics are far removed from many people’s priorities, which range from simply making a living to fighting global warming. “There’s no Brexit on a dead planet,” said Lauren McDonald, a Glasgow student who recently quit college to mobilize against climate change. Again and again, though, people came back to the politics of nationalism, austerity and economic alienation. And in Shirebrook and beyond, the frustrations were rooted in Brexit. Since the surrounding constituency was formed in 1950, its mostly working-class residents have always elected a Labour lawmaker. Then came the 2016 Brexit referendum, in which seven in 10 local voters supported Britain’s departure from the European Union. Many are now furious that the country still hasn’t left. “Every time you turn the television on, it’s all Brexit,” said Kevin Cann, a Shirebrook resident and former miner who voted to leave. “By now it should have been done, dusted.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a pro-Brexit Conservative, hopes to turn his minority government into a majority by capitalizing on that frustration. For the first time ever, that could tip Shirebrook’s seat to the Conservatives, a party once detested in mining constituencies like this one. “Miners now are like, ‘Oh, Boris, Boris,’” said Alan Gascoyne, who once headed the mine’s union branch and now runs a former miners’ club. “Crazy,” he added. The local warehouse is at the heart of this extraordinary shift, both in Shirebrook and across post-industrial England. It was built in 2005 on the site of the town’s former coal pit. For years, the mine was the pride of Shirebrook — the reason the town was built in 1896. The work there was dangerous, but it provided secure jobs, fair salaries and pensions, as well as a sense of purpose and community. The pit was “like the mother,” Mr. Gascoyne said. “The mother sort of looked after everybody.” But the mine closed in 1993, amid a wider process of deindustrialization and privatization carried out by the same Conservative Party that Mr. Johnson now leads.  Twelve grim years later, it was physically replaced by the warehouse, but the emotional void remained. The warehouse provides more jobs than the mine did, but it is mostly low-paid work in humiliating conditions. A worker gave birth in the warehouse and left the baby in a bathroom. Others were penalized for taking short breaks to drink water. A parliamentary inquiry found that the owners, Sports Direct, treated its workers “without dignity or respect.”  Most residents refused to work in such a degrading environment, so the jobs are largely taken by people from poorer parts of the European Union. In the local consciousness, the concept of regional decline then became fused with that of European immigration, instead of neoliberal economics. “I looked at what was around me, and I looked at the dilution of wages — because Europeans are coming in,” said Franco Passarelli, the son of Italian immigrants, explaining why he voted to leave the European Union. “We’re only a small island, and if people keep coming in, basically the country is starting to implode.” In a Brexit-less world, this town might still vote en masse for Labour. The party’s manifesto promises to raise the minimum wage and scrap the kinds of employment contracts used at the warehouse. But all of this has been trumped by Brexit. Before joining the European Union, Britain was “quite a wealthy country,” said Mr. Cann, the former miner. “Why can’t we be that again?” In Shirebrook, as in much of Britain, I sensed that following through with Brexit was seen as something that could restore the social fabric. But elsewhere, it was chewing at the ties that bind. For some wealthy Londoners, who typically vote Conservative but also like Europe, Brexit has undermined their support for Mr. Johnson’s party. For some ethnic and religious minorities, it is even menacing.  To illustrate this point, Maxie Hayles, a veteran campaigner for racial equality, took me to a hotel in the puddled center of Birmingham, Britain’s second city. The hotel had long been refurbished, its floor plan altered, even its name changed. But finally, Mr. Hayles found a particular room.   This was the place where in 1968 Enoch Powell, a former government minister, made a notoriously racist speech claiming immigration would ruin Britain. To this day, that speech remains synonymous for some Britons with prejudice and division. Mr. Hayles, who was then a 25-year-old Jamaican immigrant, still remembers the fear it gave his community. Britain has since changed. A black-owned business now occupies Mr. Powell’s office. The hotel room has been divided in two, repaneled and recarpeted. But Brexit risks tearing up the metaphorical carpet again, Mr. Hayles warned. Racist attacks increased around the time of the referendum campaign, by about a fifth. The prime minister has compared hijab-wearers to mailboxes. And Mr. Powell has a modern-day cheerleader in Nigel Farage, Brexit’s biggest proponent. “We’re not into good times, in terms of Brexit and what it means for black minorities in Britain,” Mr. Hayles said. “It’s serious days ahead.” In London, at a rabbinical school in a 300-year-old manor house, I had lunch with Laura Janner-Klausner, the most senior rabbi in British Reform Judaism. She is no Brexit supporter, but she also fears prejudice from another quarter: Under Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party’s leadership has been slow to address instances of anti-Semitism. Addressing poverty is a moral issue for Jews, Rabbi Janner-Klausner said. “Which is why, in the past, the natural place for Jews in this country was the Labour party.” So while she and many Jewish voters have traditionally voted Labour — her father was a Labour lawmaker, as was his father before him — she will not in this election.  She is not alone. Several Labour lawmakers have quit in horror, including Luciana Berger, who is running in Rabbi Janner-Klausner’s constituency for the Liberal Democrats, a rival centrist party. And last month, the spiritual head of Britain’s Orthodox Jews said Mr. Corbyn’s leadership put at stake “the very soul of our nation.” Rabbi Janner-Klausner did not go as far. She said that the biggest threat to British minorities remained the far right. “But here,” she said, “I will vote for Luciana.” We turned left at the pink pub, through the mist, then up into the Welsh mountains. Down a track to the right stood the Davies farm. Ceri Davies was in the barn behind the house, checking the renovations. Wales does not loom large in British political discourse. Its independence movement is smaller than Scotland’s. But even in these remote uplands, something is nevertheless stirring, partly thanks to Brexit. Mr. Davies has lived all of his life in this single valley, barring three months in a nearby town. He speaks Welsh with friends and didn’t know a word of English until school. His father was a sheep farmer, and so is Mr. Davies. His 750 sheep grazed on the slopes above us. Brexit threatens that — hence the barn. Like many British farms, Mr. Davies’s business breaks even only because of a subsidy from the European Union. Worse still, Europe beyond Britain’s borders buys about a third of Welsh lamb. The Conservatives have promised to replace the subsidies with new payments. But if European officials place tariffs on British meat after Brexit, it might ruin farms like Mr. Davies’s. “It is pretty scary,” he said. So the barn, along with the lush meadow behind it, is his insurance. Mr. Davies and his wife, Rebecca Ingleby Davies, plan to turn the meadow into a luxury campsite, or “glampsite.” The barn will house the showers. There is an irony to it: Idealized as a return to British traditions and heritage, Brexit might instead finish some of them off. “This area is really built around farming,” Ms. Ingleby Davies said. “If you take that away, then you’re going to lose a massive amount of culture and community.”  Not to mention the Welsh language, which is spoken more often in rural areas. Mr. Davies is sanguine — he gets on with everybody, even the people whose Brexit votes might wreck his business. But Ms. Ingleby Davies finds it harder to forget. There are people she now avoids, certain gatherings she boycotts. That frustration has swelled into something more profound. She wants Wales to stay in the European Union — as an independent country. That is still a minority view. But polling suggests that up to a third of Welsh voters are warming to the idea as Brexit rumbles on and the specter of English nationalism rises. “I wouldn’t consider myself a nationalistic person,” Ms. Ingleby Davies said. But she thought that an independent Wales, protected by the European Union, would be “stronger than just being, you know, an afterthought in London.” The ferry slid from the Liverpool docks, past the red cranes and into the Irish Sea. Outside, the waves were gentle. In the canteen, passengers were seething. Alan Kinney set aside his tuna salad to make his point. “It would be a big, big betrayal,” he said. The cause of his anger was the sea itself: This stretch of water between two parts of the United Kingdom — Britain and Northern Ireland — has become the latest obstacle to Brexit. During the last decades of the 20th century, nationalists in Northern Ireland unsuccessfully fought to reunite the territory, which remains under British control, with the Republic of Ireland, which won independence in 1922. Most paramilitaries put down their arms in 1998, after a peace deal opened the land border between northern and southern Ireland. To avoid enforcing post-Brexit customs checks on that land border, Mr. Johnson has effectively agreed to treat the entire island of Ireland as a single customs area. Customs checks will instead be enforced on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland, in sea ferries like this one.  That might placate many Irish nationalists. But it has enraged the territory’s loyalists — Northern Irish residents, mainly from Protestant backgrounds, who want to remain within the United Kingdom. They feel the customs checks would create a reunified Ireland in all but name. Mr. Kinney, a member of the Orange Order, a hard-line loyalist group, pulled a magazine from his bag. “No to a sea border,” the centerfold read. “No to an economic united Ireland! No surrender!” The next article was about Catholic pedophiles. Three tables away, Tim McKee fortunately had not heard our conversation. A nationalist, Mr. McKee certainly did not want a land border. But a sea border was no good either: It might set off a violent backlash from loyalist paramilitaries. He feared a repeat of the 1970s, when he was nearly blown up by loyalist bomb. “Johnson’s actions,” he whispered, “are going to kill my friends.” Dotted throughout the cabins, several loyalists echoed Mr. Kinney and several nationalists agreed with Mr. McKee. But Susan and Jack Price bucked the trend. The Prices were Protestants by birth. But forced to choose, they would prefer a sea border within the United Kingdom to a land border with Ireland. Perhaps more surprisingly, both said Brexit had made them more supportive of Irish reunification. Though loyalist by background, they ultimately felt more attachment to Europe than Britain. “I just feel,” said Mr. Price, a teacher, “that being a European is more important.” In a wasteland on the edge of the Scottish town of Motherwell, our final stop, Tommy Brennan pointed out things that were no longer there. There had stood the factory gates, he said, there the cooling towers. This was once one of Europe’s biggest steelworks, where Mr. Brennan first worked in 1943. But now there was nothing but yellowing grass. Once bigger than Central Park, the Ravenscraig steelworks was shut and dismantled in 1992, after being privatized by London’s Conservative government. That put an estimated 10,000 residents out of work, including Mr. Brennan. In Shirebrook, I saw how deindustrialization eventually contributed to Brexit. But in Motherwell it helped heighten resentment of the British state rather than of Europe: In 2016, this area voted to stay in the European Union, but in a Scottish independence referendum in 2014 it favored leaving the United Kingdom. Mr. Brennan was among those voters — he had concluded that London would never prioritize Scottish interests. “If we’d been an independent nation when Ravenscraig closed,” he said, “it would never have closed.” Yet alienation takes many forms, even in the same town. After talking with Mr. Brennan, I crossed Motherwell to meet a woman born the year after the steelworks closed. With little permanent work in a post-steel Motherwell, Ashleigh Melia had spent her adult life in temporary jobs on the minimum wage. Now, in her work as a cleaner, employers sometimes send her away as soon as she arrives — there’s no work that day, and therefore no pay. The Conservatives’ decision to shrink the British state in recent years, cutting welfare payments by about $40 billion, has also squeezed her family. Her 4-year-old daughter, half blind and half deaf, has been denied disability allowances worth up to $460 a month.  Fired from her latest job in October, Ms. Melia now struggles to pay bills, her four children joining the 600,000 British minors who have fallen into poverty under the Conservatives. To cut electricity costs, she encourages them to play in the dark. But unlike with Mr. Brennan, all of this has not led to political engagement. Rushing from job interviews to hospital appointments, and with no internet at home, she had no time to think about politics. She couldn’t name most political parties. She had no opinion on Scottish independence.  It was a reminder of another reality — one in which many find it hard enough to live, without worrying how to vote.  The steelworks?  Ms. Melia had never heard of it.']",
Iran’s Leaders Soften Stance on Protesters,2019-12-05,By Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone,"['Faced with a simmering fury in the country, Iran’s leaders on Wednesday abruptly softened their stance toward street protests that are believed to have left hundreds of civilians dead last month, the most lethal crackdown since the 1979 revolution. The change, led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, signaled that the hierarchy was scrambling to manage resentment worsened by a brutal suppression of protests throughout the country after gasoline prices were increased by at least 50 percent without warning on Nov. 15.  The authorities shut down the internet for 10 days and deployed security forces to quell the unrest, including through the use of firearms. Unofficial accountings have said between 180 and 450 people were killed — figures that the government has disputed as baseless or speculative. But it has not provided a confirmed total.  Mr. Khamenei, who previously had denounced the protesters as rioters, thugs, monarchists and enemy agents, called on the judiciary to show “Islamic mercy” and draw a distinction between people who had demonstrated against the gasoline prices and those who had pillaged and burned public property. In what appeared to be another significant concession, Mr. Khamenei said he had approved the term “martyr” to be used for citizens who were “caught in crossfire and riots and died without playing any role in instigating them,” according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Martyr is among the highest honors bestowed posthumously on loyal servants of the Islamic Republic. Mr. Rouhani announced the formation of a committee, consisting of the ministers of interior and justice and his legal adviser, to investigate the unrest and propose compensation for Iranians who lost loved ones or suffered financial loss. Political analysts said the measures suggested that Mr. Khamenei may now believe he miscalculated the effects of a tough response on angry citizens increasingly weary of economic deprivations.  “They are adding that money, paying money to calm them down,” said Rasool Nafisi, an Iranian academic and publisher in the United States. He called it “a very important step, because Khamenei’s view is that you should not yield to protests.” Expressions of anger in Iran over the crackdown have proliferated, particularly since the internet blackout was eased starting last week. Some have drawn an analogy between the shooting of protesters and a deadly crackdown in 1978 by government forces that helped precipitate the downfall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi a year later.  The popularity of Mr. Rouhani’s government and his political party may have been significantly weakened in the aftermath of the protests. Both supporters and opponents criticized him for what they called his mismanagement of the gasoline price increase, the suppression of the protests and an apparent indifference to the pain the uproar had caused ordinary people. “We voted for the government of wisdom and hope,’’ said Mohamad Ali Abtahi, a prominent politician from the reform movement, in a statement posted on his Telegram channel. “This government that spilled the blood of our youth and made everyone hopeless is not the same one we elected.’’ Gholamhossein Karbaschi, a former mayor of Tehran and head of a reformist political party, said in a Twitter message that Mr. Rouhani’s conduct in the aftermath of the unrest had left him “ashamed” of having ever supported him. “There isn’t an ounce of justice or wisdom,” he said of Mr. Rouhani and his government’s handling of the crisis. The protests struck as Iranians are dealing with an acute economic crisis caused in part by sanctions imposed by President Trump last year after he repudiated the nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers. Mr. Rouhani was a major proponent of that agreement, which limited Iran’s nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief.  Mr. Trump called the agreement too weak and said the tough sanctions — which have deeply cut Iran’s oil exports — were part of his “maximum pressure” campaign to force Iran to renegotiate the agreement.  Mr. Rouhani has repeatedly rebuffed Mr. Trump’s offers to talk while the sanctions remain in place. Mr. Khamenei has forbid any negotiations with the Americans and told Iranians they must prepare for a protracted period of hardship.  But on Wednesday, Mr. Rouhani teased that negotiations with Mr. Trump were still possible and that if the United States lifted the sanctions the two heads of states could meet “in one hour.”  In another development that suggested Iran was trying to find ways to communicate with Mr. Trump, Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, paid a visit this week to Japan, which has previously offered itself as a go-between with the United States. “The fact that Araghchi is now trying to get Japan to maybe mediate is an indication that maybe Khamenei might be open to negotiate,” said Abbas Milani, director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University. He also said the protests in Iran may have persuaded Mr. Khamenei that he had waited too long to resolve the sanctions and the economic pressure they have placed on Iran.']","In an apparent attempt to ease anger over the killing and arrest of protesters, senior leaders urged leniency and promised compensation for peaceful demonstrators who died.

Threats and Abuse on Campaign Trail: A Grim Reality for U.K. Female Candidates,2019-12-05,By Megan Specia,"['LEEDS, England — The campaign office is deliberately inconspicuous — tucked above a salon through an unmarked doorway in a 1970s-era shopping center. There are no campaign posters in the windows. Two cameras are trained on the entrance. The door frame was recently reinforced. They are necessary precautions, said Rachel Reeves, the Labour candidate who has represented this area of Leeds in Parliament since 2010 and uses the space as both her constituency office and now as her campaign headquarters. The death threats, abuse on social media and graffiti calling for “traitor” lawmakers to be hanged have changed her approach ahead of Britain’s upcoming general election.   This is the new reality, she and other lawmakers say, in a campaign environment that has become remarkably nasty, particularly for women, who face a torrent of abuse and threats often laced with misogyny. And it is happening across the political spectrum. “I do think it’s a very different atmosphere and environment now compared to the first two times I stood,” Ms. Reeves said. “People are a lot angrier and there’s a lot more polarization, particularly around the Brexit issue.” In the dwindling days before Britain heads to the polls, candidates, particularly women, are finding themselves campaigning in a climate where they say abuse, threats and a culture of intimidation have become the norm. With the Labour and Conservative parties hurling blame and allegations of racism and wrongdoing at each other, and anger and exhaustion over the still unresolved issue of Brexit, the country is divided like never before. Where once candidates might have tried to be as visible as possible, many are now proceeding with caution, heeding warnings from the police. The abuse is not directed entirely at women. Men have come in for their share as well.  But a study conducted during the most recent election showed that female lawmakers received disproportionately more abuse on social media, with women of color receiving an even larger share.  And when more than a dozen female lawmakers cited threats and online abuse last month as part of their rationale for not running in the upcoming election, a discomforting spotlight was again thrust on the treatment of women in British politics.  In a system where women are already underrepresented, making up just 32 percent of Parliament, some feared the abuse would drive away potential new candidates. Despite the charged atmosphere heading into the campaign, a record number of women — 1,124 of 3,322 registered candidates — are running in the election,  the BBC reported. But many say they are having to adjust to a new reality where threats and intimidation are the norm. “I think that we are a little bit more reticent in advertising where we are going to be,” Ms. Reeves said, so she instead shares photos of campaign appearances after the fact. It is a precaution the police have suggested since the murder of her close friend Jo Cox, she said.  In Leeds, the 2016 murder of Ms. Cox, a Labour lawmaker who represented the nearby area of Batley and Spen, is never far from people’s minds.  Ms. Cox was shot by a man shouting “Britain first” and “death to traitors” while she campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union ahead of the Brexit referendum. “We really needed to learn the lessons from that, and yet here we are, three and a half years later, and I think the environment is much more toxic,” Ms. Reeves said.  She believes Brexit divisions and language used by leaders in Parliament have fueled the anger. “The language of betrayal, of traitor, of treachery, of surrender,” she said, repeating words that she and many of her female Labour colleagues have criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson  for using against his opponents in the past. But, she said, the misogyny is not limited to one side of the political spectrum.  A man was jailed last month for sending a threatening letter to Anna Soubry, a onetime Conservative who now heads an upstart party, Change UK. Two Labour activists were injured in separate attacks last week while canvassing door to door. Six people have been convicted recently of criminal offenses for abuse and threats directed at Luciana Berger, a former Labour lawmaker and now Liberal Democrat candidate. Both the far right and far left went after her for her Jewish religion or her stance on Brexit. Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative lawmaker who is running to retain her seat in the constituency of Morley and Outwood, five miles south of Ms. Reeves’s area in Leeds, detailed a barrage of abuse after she won her district in the 2015 election, ending an 85-year reign by Labour.  Ms. Jenkyns — ardently pro-Brexit and an outspoken supporter of Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal deal — has received emails at her office threatening sexual violence, and detractors on social media have called her a bad mother.  Six weeks ago, her staff arrived at their office on Morley’s main street to find graffiti scrawled in the entryway: “Andrea just kill yourself pls.” Many of her campaign signs, which depict a smiling Ms. Jenkyns standing alongside Mr. Johnson, have been defaced. In one, a hole was punched through her face. Ms. Jenkyns believes the current climate is a departure from the “grown-up politics” of her first two campaigns, and she blames the heightened tensions on Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, for driving that party further to the left. But, she conceded, Brexit has also played a role.  “The sad thing is, you deal with it on a daily basis so you are probably not shocked anymore and you accept it,” Ms. Jenkyns said. “And what kind of society is that?” For the first time, Britain’s National Police Chiefs’ Council, which coordinates law enforcement across the country, and the Electoral Commission have issued a nationwide set of safety guidelines for candidates and activists. It advises canvassing in groups and encourages candidates and their supporters to report threats, including those made online. The decision to hold an election in December, when daylight is in short supply across Britain, has also forced many candidates to rethink their strategies, with some, including Ms. Jenkyns, swearing off knocking on doors in the dark because of safety concerns. Before previous elections, much of Ms. Reeves’s canvassing would take place after the workday ended. Now, it’s dark by 4:30 p.m. On Tuesday, she set out at 4 p.m., knocking on doors with a small team of volunteers who put leaflets through mail slots in the Fairfield Estate, a mixture of public housing projects and privately owned homes spread out over a steep hillside. The streetlights came on as she made her way along the densely packed terraced houses, her red Labour candidate badge visible in the darkness. Few answered the door. But those who happened to be home were mostly positive, mixed with a few curt responses from those not supporting Labour.  “I think we are certainly a little more vigilant,” Ms. Reeves said, describing a few confrontations. “We would never have someone go door-knocking by themselves.” Ms. Cox’s younger sister, Kim Leadbetter, believes that the conversation around Brexit has grown increasingly vitriolic in the years since her sister’s death. She worries it could prove damaging to the democratic process and discourage young people, particularly women, from politics.  “When Jo was murdered, there was a short period of time when politicians said all the right things about how politics needed to take a step back,” she said.  But it didn’t last. Instead, she said, anger, frustration, and violent language seem to dominate the conversation. Ms. Leadbetter, an ambassador for the Jo Cox Foundation, a nonpartisan, community-building charity that was created after her sister’s death, said that while her sister was an advocate of robust debate, “we have to be able to disagree agreeably.” While there is undoubtedly an issue with threats of violence on social media — due in part to the anonymity the platforms can provide — Ms. Leadbetter warned against dismissing them as just an online problem.  “It only takes one individual who cannot see the difference between violent, aggressive and abusive language and an act of violence that can change people’s lives forever,” she said.']",This is politics in a climate of fear and intimidation: Inconspicuous offices with no campaign posters and multiple security cameras. No canvassing after dark. Death threats.
France Is Hit by Second Day of Pension Strikes as Unions Dig In,2019-12-06,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — Angry railway employees, teachers and other workers in France showed no signs of backing down from a nationwide strike on Friday, having brought public transportation to a standstill in a protest over President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul the nation’s pension system.  Travel was  severely limited between French cities on Friday, with nine out of 10 high-speed trains and seven out of 10 regional express trains canceled. Stations around the country were almost empty, and some schools remained closed.  In Paris, most metro lines were shut down and bus services were heavily disrupted. The streets were filled with more bicycles and electric scooters than usual, as Parisians used alternative measures to zip around stalled traffic in parts of the capital.  Transportation disruptions were expected to continue into the weekend and early next week, culminating in a new day of demonstrations around the country on Tuesday, including a march in southern Paris. Labor unions want a show of force ahead of Wednesday, when the government is expected to unveil the specifics of its plan. Bernadette Groison, the head of one of France’s largest teachers union, told reporters after a meeting with other labor groups on Friday that they were “determined” to make the strikes last.  “This is not a mood swing lasting a couple days,” she said.  The government was faced with huge protests in Paris and other cities on Thursday, some of the biggest in recent years. The authorities estimated that at least 800,000 people demonstrated across the country, with labor unions putting the figure at 1.5 million.  Édouard Philippe, France’s prime minister, said in a televised address on Friday that the government was determined to streamline France’s generous pension system, by combining a complex web of 42 pension schemes and creating a points-based system for every worker, regardless of status or sector.  Mr. Philippe said that “special” retirement schemes like those for railway workers had to disappear, and that the French would progressively have to work “a little longer.” “These adaptations, these transformations, do we want to do them brutally, in a rush, or do we prefer to set them in place reasonably, progressively, without brutality, when we still have time?” Mr. Philippe said. But he also tried to placate protesters, saying that his “logic” was not that of “confrontation.”  Mr. Philippe said that it would be “unreasonable, unacceptable, unfair, to change the rules mid-game” for employees who had made life and career choices based on their past pension rights and that he was “totally” ready to “ensure that transitions are progressive.” He also promised that teacher pensions would not go down.  Mr. Philippe is expected to lay out the specifics of the pension proposals in a speech on Wednesday, but it is unclear whether that will mollify the striking workers, some of whom have vowed to continue until the plans are scrapped altogether.  The lack of details so far has left many French residents, many of whom distrust Mr. Macron, believing that their pensions will decrease.  It is not yet clear, for instance, when the pension changes would go into effect and for which generation, or how workers currently in a special pension scheme, like railway workers, would make the transition to a unified scheme. It is also unclear how difficult working conditions would be taken into account.  Jean-Paul Delevoye, a French politician whom Mr. Macron has put in charge of a report on pension changes, acknowledged on Friday that some workers felt they would be cheated out of benefits that had been promised to them years ago. But he said that a universal points-based system would be “more understandable” and fairer. “We will bring answers to the worries that are being expressed,” he said.  Mr. Delevoye’s comments on Friday came a day after transportation workers, hospitals employees, refinery staff, garbage collectors, teachers, police officers and firefighters took to the streets to express their discontent over Mr. Macron’s plans. Sporadic violence peppered the protests in Paris, Rennes, Bordeaux and other cities. The police fired tear gas as they faced off with some protesters.  Mr. Philippe told reporters on Thursday evening that despite the scattered clashes between the police and violent groups called “breakers,” the “demonstrations went fine pretty much everywhere in France.” Labor union leaders are scheduled to meet with the government on Monday.  Philippe Martinez, the head of the General Confederation of Labor, one of the largest unions opposed to the pension overhaul, called for renewed pressure on the government.  “Strikes need to spread to all companies,” Mr. Martinez said on LCI, a television news channel. ']","Transportation was severely disrupted in Paris and other cities, a day after huge protests over government plans to overhaul pensions. Unions are planning more protests next week. "
"After Horrific Rape in India, Police Kill 4 Suspects",2019-12-06,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Hari Kumar,"['NEW DELHI — One of India’s most troubling rape cases of recent months was brought to a sudden and shocking end on Friday.  Four men who had been accused of raping and killing a young woman near the southern Indian city of Hyderabad were taken under a bridge by police officers and shot dead in the early hours of the morning.  How the events played out is not entirely clear.  The police, who had been under enormous pressure to bring the rapists to justice, said that they had taken the men to the scene of the crime at 3 a.m. and were in the process of watching them re-enact the attack when two of the men tried to grab the officers’ guns, leaving the officers no choice but to shoot the suspects dead.  The officers are being hailed as heroes, and were showered with rose petals by residents who thronged the streets of Hyderabad to celebrate what they saw as an act of swift retribution for a horrific crime. So many people poured into the streets on Friday to celebrate that traffic was brought to a standstill. Firecrackers could be heard exploding across the city. People hugged and passed out sweets.  “The law has done its duty,” said V.C. Sajjanar, a top police official. [Read: Indian politician is given life sentence for raping teenage girl.] But the circumstances behind the killings have invited suspicion. Human rights activists have wondered if the police simply executed the men and fabricated a story to cover their tracks.  “It’s just the outcry that pressured the government to do away with the four men and this is a total and utter violation of human rights,” said Ranjana Kumari, the director of the Center for Social Research, a nonprofit advocacy group.Ms. Kumari called the killings “a total failure of the criminal justice system.”  “We are moving toward a vigilante justice system,” she added. Too often, India makes international headlines for horrendous rapes. In 2012, a woman was abducted and brutalized on a moving bus in New Delhi by a gang of young men. After she died from her injuries, the outrage over her assault drove India to implement a series of measures to curb sexual violence, such as stricter punishments, victims’ hotlines and public awareness campaigns.  But the cases have kept coming.  Last year, virtually the entire male staff at an apartment building in the southeastern coastal city of Chennai were accused of raping a disabled girl.  This year, according to the police, a popular elected representative from Unnao district in northern India tried to kill a young woman who had accused him of rape, arranging for a truck to smash into her car.  And just this week, a young woman was set on fire as she was making her way to court to testify against men whom she had accused of rape. The woman died on Friday night, hospital officials said. The Hyderabad case centers on a young veterinarian who had parked her motor scooter near a toll plaza on the evening of Nov. 27 and came back from an appointment to find that its rear tire was flat. A group of truck drivers offered to help her, the police said, but she suspected that she was in danger. In her last call, to her sister to tell her what she was doing, she sounded scared.  The police said that the men had in fact deflated the tire as part of a plot to kidnap the young woman. The police added that the men had been drinking. They dragged the woman, who the police said was in her mid-20s, to a bushy area nearby and assaulted her. They then suffocated her and burned her body.  Police said they caught the four men — two truck drivers and their assistants — through CCTV footage and witnesses. The suspects had been in custody for about a week as the young woman’s family, activists, ordinary citizens and powerful politicians called for them to be punished. Pressure was raised further after protests erupted in several cities and outrage over the young woman’s death swept across social media. On Friday, as the news spread that all the suspects were dead, many people were quick to praise the police.“I congratulate the Hyderabad police and the leadership that allows the police to act like police,” Rajyavardhan Rathore, a member of Parliament from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said in a Twitter post.The victim’s family also seemed to approve of the men’s deaths.“Justice has been done,” the victim’s mother said, according to the BBC. “I never thought we would get justice. No other girl should experience what my daughter did.” Police officials said that two officers had been injured on Friday morning when the suspects tried to escape. When asked why they brought the men to the crime scene in the middle of the night, police officials said it was to protect them from enraged mobs who might have harmed them had the visit taken place in daytime. Extrajudicial killings are common in India. The term for a police killing here is “encounter” and in recent years the Indian police have killed countless people in such encounters. Many of the killings are later revealed to have been staged or planned.  In Friday’s case, few people are expected to rally to the defense of the dead suspects. If the killings were staged, that might have been part of the calculation.Amnesty International India said the killings raised “deeply disturbing questions about the state of justice in India.” The country’s National Human Rights Commission said it would send a team to investigate, saying the case “needs to be probed carefully.”Mrs. Kumari, the director of the nonprofit research group, said, “Maybe people are happy today.”  “But tomorrow,” she added, “you can pick up any four people and kill them for any reason.”']","The police said the men linked to the Hyderabad case had gone for officers’ guns.

"Cold Stopped a Woman’s Heart for 6 Hours, Then Helped Save Her Life",2019-12-06,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — Audrey Mash arrived at a Spanish hospital cold to the touch and all but dead: Her heart had stopped beating hours earlier, as she clung to her husband in a mountain snowstorm and her body temperature collapsed. But the cold that nearly killed her also helped to save her life. After six hours in cardiac arrest she began to breathe again, rescued by doctors who said that her hypothermic condition — almost 35 degrees below normal — protected her brain from fatal damage. “If she had been in cardiac arrest for that long with a normal body temperature, she would have died,” said Dr. Eduard Argudo, who helped treat her, in an interview Friday.  Instead, Ms. Mash, 34, stepped out to a news conference in Barcelona on Thursday, smiling alongside the doctors and rescue team that had worked to save her life. She said she felt happy and grateful to be alive.  Her near-death experience will go down as one of the most extreme on record, and Dr. Argudo said it was a record at least in Spain: the longest case of cardiac arrest in which the patient survived. Ms. Mash and her husband had gone on a hike in the Spanish Pyrenees in early November  when rain turned to surprise snow on the trail. They lost their way in the blinding weather and tried to find shelter from the wind and cold. Though they held each other for warmth, she developed severe hypothermia and went into cardiac arrest. First she began to “talk nonsense,” her husband, Rohan Schoeman, told the Catalan news Channel TV3. Then she had trouble moving. Finally she fell unconscious. “I was trying to feel a pulse,” her husband said. “I couldn’t feel a breath. I couldn’t feel a heartbeat.” By the time the emergency workers rescued the couple, her body temperature was 64 degrees Fahrenheit, well below the average 98.6. A helicopter rescue team airlifted her to the Vall d’Hebron Hospital in Barcelona and doctors hurried to try to save her, though she was by all appearances dead.  “She was blue and cold and she had no vital signs,” said Dr. Argudo, who had been called back to the hospital to help with the unusual case. The doctors thought that they had a chance: Although the cold had stopped Ms. Mash’s heart, it also protected her brain and other organs from the damage. Dr. Argudo’s team deployed a specialized tool — normally used for infants with breathing or heart problems — that had never been used in Spain for someone in Ms. Mash’s state. The tool, an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine, known as Ecmo, takes blood from the patient, infuses it with oxygen and then reintroduces it to the body and circulates it through the bloodstream.             It also allows doctors to control the blood’s temperature, which they slowly increased until Ms. Mash’s body temperature reached a point where they could use a defibrillator to shock her heart into beating normally again. The medical team had prepared her husband for the possibility that she could show  brain damage when she woke up, but that fear was dispelled when she was taken off sedation two days after the rescue.  “We were really happy and surprised when she woke up and immediately asked, ‘What am I doing here?’ and ‘Who are you?’ ” Dr. Jordi Riera, the director of the Ecmo program at the hospital, said in an interview. Beating all expectations of a long period of healing, she has already made a near-full recovery. Ms. Mash was discharged from the hospital 12 days after her rescue.  Medical journals have long noted cases of people who emerged from yearslong comas. And medical studies of hypothermic cardiac arrests in Norway have explored the cases of patients who survived after their core body temperature dropped to 56 degrees Fahrenheit and they spent nearly seven hours in that condition. She plans to return to work as an English-language teacher in Barcelona on Wednesday, but before that she will try to go for a run this weekend, she said in a phone interview on Friday.  Ms. Mash remembers nothing about the traumatic experience. Her last memory before waking up in the intensive care unit is of heading off to hike with her husband. “People keep asking me how I feel it has changed me, but I do not have the memory,” she said in the interview. “I never considered the fact that I might die. But it is different for my husband and parents — they were in a very stressful situation.” The couple believe that Mr. Schoeman experienced possible mild hypothermia that did not require treatment. Born in Britain, she spent part of her childhood in South Africa, where she met her husband, and has also lived in China. The couple moved to Barcelona two years ago.  She is a keen hiker and tries to go to the mountains with her husband at least once a month, and has previously trekked in the Himalayas. Doctors said that her experience there might have helped her to survive, in addition to her young age and active lifestyle.  The hypothermia has left Ms. Mash with some mobility and sensitivity issues in her fingers, which means she cannot do  buttons  or put earrings in on her own, she said, but she hopes that will improve. She praised the 40 people involved in her rescue and medical treatment as “absolute heroes who should be in the limelight for this.” At the news conference, she called herself lucky. “I’m the one who didn’t have to do anything,” she said. While near-death experiences can prompt some people to reassess their priorities in life, she said that was not her style.  “There is nothing I am going to be changing about my life,” Ms. Mash said. “I like my life. I have good friends; I love my job and my husband. If anything, it has made me realize how much I do not want to lose that.”  The experience has also not deterred her from one of her favorite activities. “I hope that in spring we will be able to start hiking again,” Ms. Mash said. “I don’t want this to take away that hobby from me.” But she will steer clear of the mountains in winter.']",Audrey Mash got caught in a snowstorm while hiking in the Pyrenees.

"Election Fraud Aided Evo Morales, International Panel Concludes",2019-12-05,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['An independent international audit of Bolivia’s disputed election concluded that former President Evo Morales’s officials resorted to lies, manipulation and forgery to ensure his victory. Bolivia’s general elections on Oct. 20 were marred by “a series of malicious operations aimed at altering the will expressed at the polls,” auditors from the Organization of American States said in a 100-page final report released Thursday. Deliberate wrongdoing by election officials, combined with a series of errors and irregularities in the vote count, made it impossible to validate the results, the auditors added. The election’s initial official results handed Mr. Morales, Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, an unprecedented fourth term in office, defying the constitutional term limits he himself had set. An unexplained delay in the vote count, however, triggered a wave of protests across Bolivia’s major cities, which eventually forced Mr. Morales to resign and flee into exile in Mexico. Mr. Morales himself agreed to the international report. His government called on the O.A.S. to conduct a “binding” audit of the vote in an attempt to quell the unrest triggered by his victory. Mr. Morales’s party has since voted to annul the elections and hold a new vote; Mr. Morales is banned from running in the new election. A caretaker government arrested Bolivia’s top election officials on accusations of fraud and moved to elect a new electoral board. The election ban marked a definitive end to Mr. Morales’s transformative 14 years in office, during which he lifted millions of Bolivians out of poverty, made major advances in civil rights and diversified the economy. Mr. Morales’s economic and political successes, however, bred increasingly authoritarian tendencies that eventually led to his downfall. After declaring victory despite accusations of fraud, Mr. Morales failed to reestablish control of the mutinous cities. The final push came on Nov. 10, when the military asked Mr. Morales to resign to restore national peace. He left for exile the next day. Mr. Morales was replaced by a conservative interim government, which moved to suppress his supporters and prosecute his officials. More than 30 people died in the unrest following the Oct. 20 vote, most of them Mr. Morales’s supporters who protested his ouster. The report by the O.A.S.’s 36 auditors accused Bolivia’s election officials of setting up a “parallel technological scheme” of hidden servers, which permitted the alteration of results and forging of signatures of electoral observers. The protests were triggered by the electoral board’s decision to stop counting votes when it appeared that Mr. Morales didn’t have a large enough margin of victory to avoid a runoff. When the final count resumed a day later, the remaining votes overwhelmingly went to Mr. Morales, allowing him to clinch the victory. The O.A.S. auditors said the sudden halt in the transmission of results was “intentional, arbitrary and without technical basis.” In their initial statements and a preliminary audit following the election, the O.A.S. officials called the sudden change in the voting trend “statistically unlikely.” The comments triggered criticism from some economists and statisticians in the United States, who argued that the change could be explained by strong support for Mr. Morales in the outstanding precincts. Those critics, however, have not addressed the accusations of hidden data servers, forged signatures and other irregularities found by the O.A.S. observers, nor have they tried to explain the electoral council’s sudden decision to stop the count.']",Charges of voting fraud that led to protests and the exile of President Evo Morales have been confirmed in a final report by the Organization of American States. 
North Korea Threatens New ‘Dotard’ Insults if Trump Revives Name-Calling,2019-12-05,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Thursday threatened to resume calling President Trump bad names, including a “dotard,” two days after he again called its leader “Rocket Man” and raised the possibility of using military force. North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, said that if Mr. Trump deliberately stoked “the atmosphere of confrontation” once again, then that “must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.”  Ms. Choe issued her statement, which was carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, in response to remarks Mr. Trump made in London on Tuesday, on the sidelines of his meetings with NATO leaders.  “We’re by far the most powerful country in the world,” Mr. Trump said, urging North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to honor his promise to denuclearize. “And, hopefully, we don’t have to use it, but if we do, we’ll use it.” Although he said he still had “a good relationship” and “confidence” in Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump also \u200bemployed the mocking nickname he had used against the North Korean leader when he and Mr. K\u200bim traded threats of war and personal insults two years ago. “He definitely likes sending rockets up, doesn’t he?” Mr. Trump said, referring to the \u200brecent \u200bseries of short-range ballistic and rocket tests\u200b by North Korea\u200b. “That’s why I call him ‘Rocket Man.’” On Wednesday, the North Korean military vowed to retaliate if the United States used military force. But on Thursday, Ms. Choe said her government was more upset by Mr. Trump’s name-calling against its leader than his threat to use military force. She warned that \u200bNorth Korea could resume a war of insults against Mr. Trump. “If Trump’s remarks on use of force and metaphor were a mistake, it would be a relief, but if they were a calculated provocation intended against us, that makes things different,” Ms. Choe said. In his United Nations speech in September 2017, Mr. Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea and famously called Mr. Kim a “Rocket Man” on “a suicide mission\u200b.” Mr. Trump issued his 2017 threat after North Korea flight-tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles and detonat\u200bed what it called a hydrogen bomb in its sixth and most powerful underground nuclear test. Mr. Kim delivered an equally famous rejoinder. “A frightened dog barks louder,” Mr. Kim said, referring to Mr. Trump. “I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.” Two months later, North Korea launched its most powerful international ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15, which demonstrated the potential to reach the mainland United States.  In a dramatic shift, \u200bhowever, \u200bMr. Kim and Mr. Trump started engaging in diplomacy in 2018, with Mr. Trump going so far as to say that he and Mr. Kim “fell in love.” In June 2018, they held their first summit meeting in Singapore, during which Mr. Kim promised to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” in return for “new” relations and security guarantees from Washington. But subsequent negotiations have stalled over how to implement the broadly worded agreement, and North Korea has sounded increasingly frustrated about negotiating with Washington in recent months.  It has resumed short-range missile tests this year, warning that it would formally end diplomacy unless Washington made more concessions by the end of December.']","North Korea threatened to resume tit-for-tat insults against President Trump two days after he called its leader, Kim Jong-un, a “Rocket Man.”"
Nepal’s Animal-Sacrifice Festival Slays On. But Activists Are Having an Effect.,2019-12-06,By Bhadra Sharma,"['BARIYARPUR, Nepal — The animals were bused to southern Nepal in the thousands: rats, starved goats and pigeons stuffed in bags.  But that was just part of the sacrifice. A few hundred butchers then gathered on Tuesday with curved knives to decapitate water buffalo during what is believed to be the world’s largest ritual slaughter, the weekslong Gadhimai festival in the town of Bariyarpur, near Nepal’s southern border with India.  As the butchers hacked away in a closed arena about the size of a soccer field, devotees tried climbing walls topped with barbed wire to catch a glimpse. “It’s always fun to behead animals,” said Ram Aashish Das, who said he had slaughtered 30 buffalo this week. “If the tradition is so bad, why are so many people coming here?” For centuries, the story goes, thousands of animals have been sacrificed in the town every five years to appease the goddess Gadhimai, who many believe has the power to grant wishes. Hindu pilgrims have long made it a point to come witness the slaughter. (Though killing cows, a sacred animal to Hindus, is prohibited in parts of India and Nepal, slaughtering water buffalo does not carry the same taboo.) But this year’s festival has played out differently. Nepal’s central government refused to fund the event, citing a Supreme Court ban on supporting animal sacrifices. In recent days, activists and police officials have gathered along Nepal’s border with India, from where many of the animals are illegally smuggled, and tried to block trucks from passing through. Their efforts have paid off. In 2009, during a particularly brutal festival, up to 500,000 animals were slaughtered. Five years later, the number was reduced to 30,000. And on Tuesday, this year’s heaviest day for sacrifices, about 3,500 buffalo were killed, activists said. Those numbers will increase when the rest of the sacrificed animals are counted, but are unlikely to reach 30,000. “The suffering of these animals is so upsetting,” Alokparna Sengupta, Humane Society International’s managing director in India, said in a statement. “They have endured exhausting journeys to get here and are paraded in front of a baying crowd as all around them they witness other animals being decapitated, one by one.” Ms. Sengupta said her group had pleaded with the head priest at the Gadhimai temple to cancel the festival, reminding her of a pledge the temple made several years ago to end it, but that “he has chosen to do nothing as far as we are aware.” On Monday, a day before the killings started, Manoj Gautam, a Nepali animal rights activist, filed a contempt-of-court case against the government and the temple committee for not doing more to stop the gathering. In 2014, India outlawed transporting animals across the border to the Gadhimai festival. Shortly after, Nepal’s Supreme Court banned officials from supporting the festival. But those rulings have not fully curbed its popularity in Nepal, a mountainous, majority Hindu nation. Early this week, hundreds of thousands of devotees, many from some of India and Nepal’s poorest villages, arrived in Bariyarpur on tractors and packed buses. Some walked barefoot for miles to pray to the goddess. Before the killings began, event supporters chased animal rights activists from a hotel, yelling at them that the tradition was an integral part of their religion. “People come here with animals and fear that something bad may happen if their promise to the goddess is not delivered,” said Birendra Yadav, the secretary of the festival’s organizing committee. “We are not encouraging people to sacrifice animals, but neither can we reject it.” Locals believe the Gadhimai festival started around 265 years ago, when a Nepali farmer called Bhagwan Chaudhary had a dream that his problems could be solved if he offered blood to the goddess Gadhimai. For the initial sacrifice, he lanced five points on his body.  Since then, the metrics have changed, with animal blood replacing human blood, and Mr. Chaudhary’s descendants assuming leadership positions in the temple. Today’s Gadhimai festival has become so popular that wealthy businessmen and politicians have constructed welcome signs along the road leading to Bariyarpur.  Despite security patrols along Nepal’s porous border with India, dozens of trucks arrived in town carrying animals shriveled from dehydration and lack of food. Buffalo were transported using tractors. Goats and pigeons were moved in containers strapped to the roofs of buses. Though the festival lasts a few weeks, the slaughter typically takes place on the last two days. It begins with a sacrifice of the “pancha bali,” a set of five animals: a rat, a goat, a buffalo, a pig and a chicken. At the entrance to the main arena, which was not accessible to the public, butchers carrying kukri knives whooped Tuesday morning as the temple’s committee read out their names. The crowd cheered as the men stepped inside the enclosure, where thousands of buffalo were eating grass and hay, to start the sacrifice.  About six hours later, when every buffalo had been killed, the butchers emerged from the arena with blood-soaked feet.  “Only good and happy people come here,” said Jaya Kumar Ram, a Nepali pilgrim standing outside the enclosure. “Because of blessings from the goddess, I have four children now and they are all in good health.” As evening fell, festival organizers began preparations to move the carcasses.  They would bury the heads near the temple complex, and ship the skins and meat for sale in Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital. Then they would transform the field once again, into a ground for soccer and cricket matches.

‘Black Friday’ Headline Is Condemned by Stars of Italian Soccer,2019-12-06,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The front-page headline was designed to attract attention. For a match on Friday between Inter Milan and Roma, two of the biggest soccer clubs in Italy, it was only two words, one in yellow and one in white, and in all-capital letters.  “BLACK FRIDAY.” The headline, on Thursday’s edition of Corriere dello Sport, one of Italy’s main sports newspapers, immediately drew condemnation from anti-racism groups, the two black players pictured and even various clubs in a country that has struggled to deal with racism in general and racism in soccer in particular. It referred to two players — Chris Smalling, a defender for Roma, and Romelu Lukaku, a forward for Inter Milan. If the headline, written in English, was intended to be a clever play on a phrase normally associated with holiday season bargains, it did not work. Lukaku said on his social media accounts that it was “one of the dumbest headlines” he had ever seen, and scolded the paper for fueling negativity and racism.  Smalling described it as “wrong and insensitive,” and he encouraged the editors to “understand the power they possess.” In the face of widespread condemnation over the headline, the newspaper insisted that it had done nothing wrong. It said, in a new headline in Friday’s editions, that the criticism had been no less than a “lynching.” “Who Are You Calling Racist?” was the headline in the Friday paper, surrounded by images of past front pages, as well as editorials, denouncing racism in soccer.  “‘Black Friday,’ was the innocent title of a daily, ours, that for almost a century has defended, obstinately and passionately, the values of sport,” the paper’s editor, Ivan Zazzaroni, wrote. “But it was transformed into poison by those who have poison in them.” Italy has long struggled to deal with racism in the game, a persistent strain that has tainted the country’s most popular sport but is frequently played down when it is acknowledged at all.  Lukaku, though he has only been in Italy for a few months, was already familiar with racial abuse. When he was greeted by monkey chants during a game in Cagliari in September, the Sardinian club dismissed as “outrageous” any suggestion that its fans might be racist.  Last month, Brescia defended controversial comments by a top club official about one of its own players, Mario Balotelli, who was born to Ghanaian parents, and whose adoptive mother is Jewish, as a “misunderstood joke.”  Black players in Italy, including the Juventus midfielder Blaise Matuidi, a former teammate, Moise Kean, who now plays in England, and A.C. Milan’s Ivory Coast midfielder Franck Kessie have continually been subject to racist incident. Last month, a Roma-Napoli game was temporarily suspended after Roma fans targeted the Senegalese player Kalidou Koulibaly, who plays for Napoli. Anti-Semitic insults are also not uncommon at stadiums. There are signs that many prominent figures in the sport have had enough. The headline appeared two days after Luigi De Siervo, the chief executive of Serie A, Italy’s top league, vowed that the league would root out racism “stadium by stadium,” ensuring that those responsible would be banned from games, although he was referring to racism from fans, not the media.  “We must punish them in the most severe form — that is, expulsion from the stadiums,” Mr. De Siervo told reporters at a news conference hastily convened after an Italian newspaper leaked audio from a meeting in September at which he said he had asked for microphones pointed at booing fans in stadiums to be turned off so that they wouldn’t be heard on television. Last week, Italy’s 20 Serie A clubs wrote an open letter recognizing that there was a “serious problem with racism” and that the clubs had not done enough to fight it. Racist incidents “are a reason of frustration and shame for us all,” the clubs wrote, which prompted them to work alongside Italian soccer officials to draft “new laws, and more severe regulations as well as an awareness raising campaign,” according to the letter, which added: “We don’t have time to lose.” In response to the headline, Roma and A.C. Milan, Inter’s crosstown rival, banned Corriere dello Sport from their training facilities and from talking to their players for the rest of the year.  “Players, clubs, supporters and the media must be united in the fight against racism in football,” the clubs said in a statement. “We remain totally committed to tackling racism.”  Adam Smulevich, the co-author of a book about racism in Italian soccer, said that until now, reactions to racism had been superficial, “at every level,” even if the Serie A letter was “a step in the right direction.” But Mr. Smulevich added that racism could only be eradicated by an across-the-board reaction, from the admonishments of fellow players, to the clubs, to journalists, who are expected to know better. Even if the content of the Corriere dello Sport article was not racist, he said, “Many just read the headlines.” “There is an urgency to call things by their names,” Mr. Smulevich said. “The world of soccer has until now been very vague,” he added. But the fact that there had been so much controversy around the headline was a sign that awareness was growing, he said.']",A headline alongside photos of two black players in the Corriere dello Sport brought new condemnations of racism in Italy.

‘A Present From Norway and It’s Dead’: Christmas Tree Unites London in Dismay,2019-12-05,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — For some people, Christmas is all about carols, presents, Santa Claus and his reindeer. Not for Trevor Smith, for whom the highlight of the festive season is a tall, woody perennial fir that is dispatched every year from Norway to Britain: the Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square. This year, however, the tree is not a sight for sore eyes. Just two years after Romans mocked their Christmas tree, nicknaming it Spelacchio — Mangy — it’s now Londoners’ turn to unite in their shared disappointment in the sparse spruce.  “I come every year, and this one is quite bare,” Mr. Smith, 73, said on Thursday, gazing at the thin, 79-foot tree standing at the foot of the National Gallery in Central London.  Like a child excitedly unwrapping presents on Christmas morning, Mr. Smith travels every year from his house near Heathrow International Airport to Trafalgar Square after the tree is erected just to get a glimpse.  “It’s absolutely a happy day,” he said, but added that this year’s tree “just looks a bit sad.” Maybe the sea journey from Norway to Britain was too rough this year, he suggested, or climate change could be to blame. “It’s probably a bit short of water; I think it needs a drink,” said another passer-by, Mark Wansborough-Jones, also 73. The tree is an annual gift from the people of Oslo to London as a sign of gratitude for Britain’s help during World War II, the Westminster City Council said in an emailed statement. The tradition started in 1947, when King Haakon VII, who ruled Norway for 52 years, sent a tree as a thank-you gift to Britain, where he had escaped to after the Nazis invaded Norway. Year in and year out, the fir’s sole decorations are strings of white Christmas lights, in accordance with the traditional Norwegian style, the council said. The lighting ceremony in London was to take place early Thursday evening. “It is one of the highlights for every Lord Mayor to take part in this great festive event celebrating the enduring friendship between our nations,” Councilor Ruth Bush, the Lord Mayor of Westminster, said in a statement. But the frail appearance of this year’s tree has dimmed the excitement for some ahead of the event.  Daniel Freduah-Gyimah, 27, who works at Heavens Grill, a Christmas market stall in front of the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, said on Thursday that while the tree’s height was impressive, “It looks like a Christmas tree losing hair.”  Rory Loregnerd, his 58-year-old colleague, had a harsher assessment. “It’s dead,” he said, adding, “It’s a present from Norway, and it’s dead.”  He even suggested that the Norwegians probably sent this tree as a message against Brexit, despite Norway’s not being part of the European Union. Like all other Christmas trees that end up in Trafalgar Square, this fir was grown in Ostmarka, a forested area east of Oslo, where people talk to and hug trees to encourage their growth, the council said.  In a foreboding twist, the 90-year-old tree was planted close to a small lake named Trollvann, or “the water of the trolls,” according to the council.  As the ridicule against the tree piled up on social media, a Trafalgar Square Tree account on Twitter fired off ripostes.  After a social media user on Monday called the fir the “most anemic tree possible,” the account replied, “I thought I’d left the trolls behind in Norway!”  As for the numerous social media users who called it “dead” or joked that “government cuts” were to blame for the sparse Christmas tree, the account replied, “At 80ft tall the tree will not look like the one in your living room.”  “Out of the ones we’ve seen, it’s not quite as impressive,” Kate Wynn, 36, an engineer who went to see the tree with her young daughter, said on Thursday in Trafalgar Square.  But not everyone hated the tree.  “It’s amazing!” her 6-year-old daughter, Imogen, exclaimed. “It’s huge,” the girl added. “It looks like it’s a million years old.”']","“It looks like a Christmas tree losing hair,” one Londoner said of the fir in Trafalgar Square.

London Fire Commissioner Steps Down After Grenfell Criticism,2019-12-06,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The London fire chief, who has come under intense criticism for her agency’s response to the fatal Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, announced on Friday that she would resign at the end of the year. “I feel honored to have served London and I will do all I can to assist the safe transition of my responsibilities to the new London fire commissioner when they are appointed,” Dany Cotton, the commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, said in a statement. The Grenfell fire, the worst in modern British history, killed 72 people, and Grenfell United, a group of bereaved families and survivors, had long called for Ms. Cotton’s resignation. “This change in leadership is needed to keep Londoners safe,” it said in a statement. Ms. Cotton, who had planned to retire in the spring, resisted calls to step down in October, when an official inquiry into the fire found fault with the Fire Brigade and with her personally. The inquiry reported that the agency was unprepared to deal with a fire of such magnitude; that it lacked crucial information on the building; and that both firefighters and emergency operators advised residents to stay in the tower when they should have tried to escape. In the 900-page report, Martin Moore-Bick, the chairman of the Grenfell inquiry, criticized Ms. Cotton for “remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who had escaped from their burning homes with their lives.” He called the Fire Brigade “an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower Fire.” His findings infuriated firefighters and survivors, who accused him of shifting blame by focusing the first phase of the investigation on what happened on the night of the blaze. The next phase of the inquiry is expected to focus on the underlying cause of the disaster: flammable exterior cladding and insulation that allowed the fire to engulf the tower quickly. The cladding is not allowed in high-rise buildings in various countries, including the United States, and investigations after the fire concluded that it did not meet British safety standards. “All we could see was blame against the brave firefighters, who saved my family’s life,” Asma Kazmi, a survivor of the fire, said in October when the report was published. But many families viewed the firefighters and their leader quite differently. Last month the relatives of 20 people who died in the fire sent a letter to Mayor Sadiq Khan of London asking for the resignation of Ms. Cotton, whom they called “incompetent.” The blaze began at 12:50 a.m. on June 14, 2017, on the fourth floor of the 24-story tower. Like most modern high-rises, it had a concrete structure that was designed to keep any fire compartmentalized, but instead the flames spread rapidly across the exterior, a phenomenon that caught firefighters off guard. Ms. Cotton, the first woman to lead the London Fire Brigade, served as a firefighter in London for 32 years. She called the Grenfell Tower fire the worst the brigade had experienced. “The brigade has and will keep making the changes it can make and continue its fight for all of the other changes that are needed, to prevent such a terrible incident and loss of life from happening again,” she said in her statement.  Groups of survivors have accused the government of not enacting lessons learned from the fire. Thousands of people still live and work in buildings wrapped in the type of cladding that fed the inferno. “Two and a half years since the Grenfell fire, there has been no effort to identify the buildings most at risk or to prioritize work on the basis of safety” Natasha Elcock, the chair of Grenfell United, wrote to British party leaders on Tuesday. “Action is needed now.” Mr. Khan thanked Ms. Cotton for her service at the London Fire Brigade, and called her decision to resign “the right one.”  He added in a statement that he would soon appoint a new fire chief who could quickly “deliver on the recommendations made in the Grenfell Tower Inquiry report.”']",Families of victims who died in the Grenfell Tower fire had called for Dany Cotton’s resignation.

The election, of course, left Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals without a voting majority in the House of Commons. And that made the Speech From The Throne that officially kicked off the 43rd Parliament arguably of more interest than many. Governor General Julie Payette, as Queen Elizabeth II’s representative, read it. But, of course, the text was the work of the prime minister’s office. There was, however, one tiny section that may have been the work of Ms. Payette, a former astronaut. “We know that we are inextricably bound to the same space-time continuum and on board the same planetary spaceship,” the governor general said. “If we put our brains and smarts and altruistic capabilities together, we can do a lot of good.” Like all throne speeches, the speech previewed Mr. Trudeau’s legislative ambitions. At times, its promises were very specific: a vow to cut mobile phone bills by 25 percent, although how that would be achieved remains for the future. But on other issues, the government stopped well short of promising action. Somewhat out of the blue, the governor general, speaking for the government, said that universal dental care, a cause close to the hearts of the New Democrats, is “worth exploring, and I encourage parliament to look into this.” But, that aside, there was little that Mr. Trudeau had campaigned on or announced during the previous Parliament, including a ban on military-style rifles, a pledge to eliminate carbon emissions in Canada by 2050, tax cuts for all but the highest earners and introducing legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples within a year.  There was, however, surprisingly little in the speech dealing directly with concerns specific to Alberta and Saskatchewan, the two provinces that shut out Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals. After vowing to intensify its fight against climate change, the government added that “it will also work just as hard to get Canadian resources to new markets, and offer unwavering support to the hardworking women and men in Canada’s natural resources sectors, many of whom have faced tough times recently.”  “To me it sounded like a campaign platform more than a throne speech,” said Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “And I’m not surprised by that because I think first, we’re in a period of permanent campaigning and second, in a minority government situation there’s more of a sense that, ‘Hey, we can lose confidence anytime and be back on the campaign trail.’” For Mr. Trudeau, the return of Parliament helped swiftly change the channel, at least in Canada, from his Buckingham Palace cocktail hour chatter about President Trump during this week’s NATO meeting in London.

A Look Back at Political Hot Mic Moments] [Read: Late Night Can’t Get Enough of World Leaders Laughing at Trump] And for Canadians who watched the live broadcast, the throne speech allowed a peek at the sometimes arcane ritual that surrounds parliament. It is a rare occasion when the members of the House of Commons pay a visit to the Senate chamber.  That already ritual-laden procedure was extra complicated this week because Parliament’s center block is closed for renovations. So members of the House piled into a fleet of Parliamentary minibuses at their temporary home in the West Block for the long drive of about 700 meters to the former railway station that has been transformed into the Senate. They were invited to make that trip by J. Greg Peters, the Usher of the Black Rod, a Senate official whose many ceremonial duties include effectively acting as M.C. during throne speeches. Professor Turnbull acknowledged that the ceremony, which comes from Britain’s Parliament, may seem elitist and not all that accessible to every Canadian. But she argued that it still had value. “It reminds all of us that none of us is above the institution, the history and the tradition,” she said. “I think that there’s kind of a peace and a calmness in it.” A year after Canadian officials arrested her at Vancouver’s airport at the request of the United States, the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is still going through extradition proceedings and living effectively under house arrest. In an open letter this week, she wrote that she had experienced “moments of fear, pain, disappointment, helplessness, torment, and struggle,” while also thanking Canadian security officers for their kindness. But the open letter provoked a backlash in China. Among other things, Ms. Meng’s life in her luxurious Vancouver home was contrasted with the fate of Li Hongyuan, a former Huawei employee who was jailed for 251 days for demanding severance pay after his contract wasn’t renewed. About 18,000 acres of potatoes in Canada have become frozen in the ground and can’t be harvested this year. But, perhaps to the dismay of physicians and dietitians, that won’t lead to a shortage of French fries. In his look at what domestication of animals actually means, James Gorman found that there used to be an International Fox Show in Montreal. And during the 1921 edition, a fox breeder from Prince Edward Island brought two tame foxes to a dance “where the girls did the fox trot with these foxes around their necks.” As a bonus, the article also reveals that Summerside has an International Fox Museum and Hall of Fame. The residents of a South Korean village enjoy tax breaks and other special benefits. But there’s a big catch: They live in a place that’s been called the scariest place on earth. China’s crackdown on fentanyl is genuine, but the drug problem is persisting. Dan Levin, whom you may remember from his time reporting with me on Canada, has grimly documented the toll drugs have taken on one American high school class in the 19 years since graduation. New York Times theater critic Jesse Green was concerned that “Jagged Little Pill,” a Broadway show based on Ottawa-born Alanis Morissette’s music, would fail to mix pop music and musical theater. But he has declared it an NYT Critic’s Pick. “It feels like a summation: of our world’s worst ills but also the way song can summon resistance to them,” he wrote.

A Movie Torn From the Pages of His Life,2019-12-06,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — From barren territory on the outskirts of Paris, Ladj Ly hit movie theaters last month with an urgent message: Multicultural France is here, it is real and it is not in good shape. The message comes directly from his own experience. Mr. Ly, 39, the son of a garbage collector from Mali, has put his whole life into a sharp-edged film that depicts the harshness of the French capital’s immigrant suburbs — the banlieues — that has won applause from French film critics of all political stripes, made President Emmanuel Macron sit up and take notice, garnered Mr. Ly a top prize at Cannes and is France’s candidate for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. What sets apart Mr. Ly’s film, “Les Misérables,” is its intimacy. He is part of this ill-understood world, grew up in it and still lives there. Authentic films about the banlieues are rare in France. The last major one, Mathieu Kassovitz’s “La Haine” (“Hatred”), in 1995, was made by an outsider.  Mr. Ly’s film is different. Before becoming a professional filmmaker, Mr. Ly was the child with the video camera in his pocket, filming rough police “interventions,” partly to protect the banlieues’ inhabitants and often suffering the consequences. “I was inspired by my own history,” he said in an interview. “Everything in the film comes from my life, from beginning to end.”  “It’s a sort of autobiography, and a witnessing,” he added. “I tried to make a film that resembles us. To live in these towers — it’s violent, it’s degrading.”  “You can only be in revolt,” Mr. Ly said, using the French word — révolté —\xa0that since Camus has come to mean a permanent state of insubordination against one’s surroundings. In “Les Misérables,” he brings the Paris suburbs crashing into the viewer’s head, using some traditional narrative techniques — the rookie cop’s initiation, the police chase, the buddy-movie, the long crescendo of violence. But these are only vehicles to help project the thought that drives Mr. Ly’s vision, along with his use of neighborhood residents in supporting roles. The thought: Everybody in this grim world of fraying housing blocks — surly cops, troubled children and bewildered parents — is in trouble. It is a universe of dilapidated stairwells, cramped apartments and barren concrete plazas, and all are in the misère, as the French would say. Hence the film’s title, which is a nod to Victor Hugo, who wrote his famous novel of the same name in the foreboding suburb where the film is set, Montfermeil. Mr. Ly’s childhood there was hardly cosseted, he said, but it was not unhappy. And his family was close-knit. “My father’s job was tough, but he was able to earn a good living,” he said. “We didn’t even realize that the neighborhood was dangerous.” Yet the harshness intruded. The film’s fiery final scenes, in which the police are ambushed in a stairwell, comes directly from his experience. “I lived that ambush,” he said. “It was horribly intense.”  Early on, at around 14, chance contact with the son of the director Costa-Gavras inspired a filmmaking ambition in Mr. Ly. At school, like so many children of the banlieues, he was destined for a mechanical vocation, as an electrical technician. That held zero interest. At 17, he bought his first video camera and began making short films with his friends. The partnership survives as a free film school largely under Mr. Ly’s direction called Kourtrajmé, from the name of the original collective. The reality of where he lived, the tough projects called Les Bosquets (The Groves), quickly converged with his budding passion. “I filmed what was around me,” he said.  It was with the camera that he gained his identity in the neighborhood. “I started filming the police in 2002-3,” Mr. Ly said. “I was the only one with a camera. As soon as the cops arrived and things began to heat up, they would call me,” he said of the young people in the neighborhood.  Everyone knew him. “His camera is his weapon,” said Jean-Riad Kechaou, a teacher in the district who wrote a book about Les Bosquets. He has known Mr. Ly for nearly 20 years, and in his book calls him “the symbol of the neighborhood.”  “He’s always denounced the injustices the residents were subjected to,” Mr. Kechaou said. “It would be, ‘Ladj Ly is here. We’ve got to stop.’ He scared the police. He had the power to expose their ‘interventions.’ He was the precursor, before smartphones.” “I became super-powerful,” Mr. Ly said, laughing. “I would never stop. I knew I had a redoubtable weapon.”  He added: “It was unconscionable what they would do. They were the only whites we saw, and they treated us like monkeys.”  In 2005, he filmed riots that shook France, eventually making a movie about them that was too tough for French television. In 2008, he filmed an act of police brutality that was picked up by the television stations and briefly made him famous. A bundle of nervous energy, he barely sat still during an interview. Startled critics in France have noted the intensity — an unusual quality in the tame, static world of well-behaved contemporary French cinema — that pulses through his work. His camera is nervous, jumping tautly from scene to scene. “Les Misérables” has struck a chord in France, inside and outside the projects. “It’s overwhelming,” said Mr. Kechaou, the teacher. “It gives the authentic picture of the banlieues that we are not used to seeing.” The film’s title hints at the sympathy and ambiguity that Mr. Ly projects on all of its characters, including the most repugnant. The racist police officer, Chris, is a nervous wreck with a dysfunctional family life. The immigrant youth with the angelic face, Issa — the victim at the center of the story, and Mr. Ly’s version of the child hero Gavroche in the Hugo novel — has demonic reserves of violence. The police officer who brutalizes him in the film’s central incident is a Franco-African, Gwada, at the edge of a breakdown. And the understated hero, Pento — a reference to an old French hair gel and synonymous with “Greaser” — is a confused white police officer who tries to do the right thing in a mean world, without immediately understanding what he is seeing. “I wouldn’t say I was sympathetic — I would just say fair,” Mr. Ly said of the film’s antiheroes, particularly Chris, the racist officer. “Everyone’s had to deal with him.” The film proceeds as a series of tense confrontations, all overhung by an atmosphere of menace: between the police and young people, between the police and the local Muslim Brothers, between the police and community advocates, and among the officers themselves. Mr. Ly captures the tension of these encounters with exactitude, because he knows them intimately. “I can’t count the number of times I was taken into custody,” he said, laughing.  The police would come to his apartment block and fill the corridor with tear gas, just to make him angry, he said. Once they came “and broke everything,” he said. “And I filmed everything.” He is not particularly hopeful about the future of integration in his country, though he says that incidents with the police are perhaps less frequent than they once were. “The young people today tell me, ‘The best moment of my life was 2005,’” when the riots broke out in immigrant suburbs throughout France. Still, he insists that France “has changed,” whether the older inhabitants acknowledge it or not.  “When you look a little more closely, France is multicultural,” he said. That is why he made the central figure of his film, the boy Issa, of mixed race. “It was important,” Mr. Ly said. “Because that is the France of today.” ']",
Nairobi’s Gold-Loving Governor Is Arrested on Corruption Charges,2019-12-06,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — The governor of Kenya’s capital city has made no secret of his love for bling: He has posted photos of a golden lion statue and a gilded  dining room set, and has shown up at meetings draped in  gold jewelry. At rallies, he hands out cash to supporters.  The governor has also been accused of drug trafficking, was recently seen slapping a journalist, and was thrown out of Kenya’s starchy Parliament for  wearing ear studs and sunglasses. But he has faced little in the way of serious consequences, until now.  On Friday, the governor, Mike Mbuvi Sonko was arrested and charged with money laundering and unlawful acquisition of property for his alleged involvement in a multimillion dollar corruption scandal.  In a news conference in Nairobi, Noordin Haji, the director of public prosecutions, accused Mr. Sonko of “deploying intimidation tactics” and “using goons to threaten law enforcement officials” who were trying to investigate the case. Mr. Sonko denied the accusations against him on Friday, calling the commission’s investigation “shallow” and saying that he had not tried to evade arrest. “I want to confidently state from the onset that I am more than ready for the lawful course that will help us know the truth,” he said in a statement on Facebook.  The arrest of Mr. Sonko comes as President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to crack down on corruption. Residents and international investors have long complained of corruption in Kenya, the business hub and richest economy in East Africa. Over the past year, Mr. Haji, the public prosecutor, has ordered the arrest of current and former public officials on charges such as dishing out millions of dollars for projects that only exist on paper.  The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, which led the investigation into the governor, said on Twitter that Mr. Sonko had been detained while trying to escape arrest at a roadblock in Voi, about 200 miles southeast of Nairobi, and was then transferred back to Nairobi. The commission also announced the arrest on Friday of the former Nairobi County secretary, along with the former head of procurement. Thirteen other people were also listed as suspects in the corruption case announced on Friday, and they were asked to present themselves at the nearest police station. These included members of the county’s tender evaluation committee, along with directors of several companies. The governor is not the only nationally prominent politician recently arrested in the  crackdown. In July, Finance Minister Henry Rotich was arrested on corruption charges related to a multimillion-dollar project to build two massive dams, becoming the first sitting cabinet member to be charged with financial misconduct in Kenya. Mr. Rotich has denied the charges. But while Mr. Kenyatta has vowed to stamp out graft, critics have said that his administration isn’t serious about fighting corruption,  calling it a mere public relations exercise. Efforts to tackle graft have also borne little results, according to the nongovernmental organization Transparency International. Mr. Sonko, who was elected in 2017, is serving his first term as governor. He was a member of Parliament for the Madaraka constituency in Nairobi starting in 2010, and was elected as a senator of Nairobi County in 2013. Nairobi, a city of about 3.5 million people, is both the capital of Kenya and the seat of  Nairobi County. Besides being a financial hub for regional and global companies, it hosts dozens of embassies and consulates. While Mr. Sonko has invited scrutiny for his showy lifestyle and colorful fashion, he has also drawn criticism for his management style. In November, lawmakers from Nairobi County said a “tragedy of untold proportions” was unfolding in the city, with poor public services and unpaid workers and suppliers. The leaders also criticized the governor for failing to appoint a new deputy after the previous one resigned in January 2018. Mr. Sonko, who has taken to publicly sneering at his perceived detractors and critics, insists that he inherited an already dysfunctional city and that he would only pay legitimate suppliers upon verification of services offered.  As senator and now governor, Mr. Sonko has ingratiated himself with the public, and especially the city’s poor, by doling out cash at rallies and paying the school fees for needy students. He also established the Sonko Rescue Team, a group of youngsters who respond to emergencies, sweep streets and take clean water to poor areas. On Thursday, the day before his arrest, Mr. Sonko received an award sponsored by the Kenya Red Cross and United Nations Volunteers for encouraging volunteering.']","Gov.

"‘I Have Told Everything,’ Says Whistle-Blower in China Crackdown",2019-12-07,"By Elian Peltier, Claire Moses and Edward Wong","['LONDON — A Uighur woman living in the Netherlands said on Saturday that she helped publicize secret Chinese government documents that shed light on how Beijing runs mass detention camps holding Muslim ethnic minorities.  She recounted how she lived in fear after she and her former husband received death threats and were contacted by Chinese security officers while journalists were preparing to report on the documents. Asiye Abdulaheb, 46, said in a telephone interview that she was involved in the release of 24 pages of documents published by Western news outlets last month, and was speaking out now to protect herself and her family from retaliation.  The documents, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and examined by journalists around the world, followed an earlier leak of 403 pages of internal papers to The New York Times that described how the authorities created, managed and justified the continuing crackdown on one million or more ethnic Uighurs and Kazakhs.  A Dutch newspaper, De Volkskrant, first reported on Ms. Abdulaheb’s role in the dissemination of that second set of documents, based on interviews with her and her ex-husband, Jasur Abibula. Both are Dutch citizens who have lived in the Netherlands since 2009, and they have a 6-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. Ms. Abdulaheb said in an hourlong interview in Mandarin Chinese with The Times that she had decided to speak out in the hopes that the publicity would dissuade the Chinese authorities from seeking to harm her or her family.  She said they already knew she had the documents, and she had told Dutch police officers about her situation. She added that the danger of her situation became evident after her husband returned from a trip to Dubai in mid-September during which Chinese security officers told him about the documents, interrogated him about Ms. Abdulaheb and tried to recruit him to spy on her. “I thought that this thing has to be made public,” she said. “The Chinese police would definitely find us. The people in Dubai had told my ex-husband, ‘We know about all your matters. We have a lot of people in the Netherlands.’” Ms. Abdulaheb said she had worked in government offices in Xinjiang, a vast northwestern region of China where the official crackdown on Muslims has taken place, but declined to go into detail.  In the interview Saturday, she confirmed that she received and helped leak the 24 pages, but she declined to explain who had sent her the documents. She said Chinese officers had told Mr. Abibula they wanted to find out who had passed her the material. The Times was part of the group coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, an independent nonprofit based in Washington, that reported on the second set of leaked documents on Xinjiang.  Ms. Abdulaheb said someone electronically sent her the 24 pages of internal Chinese documents in June.  “When I got the documents and looked at them, I concluded this was very important,” she said. “I thought the best thing to do was to put them out publicly.” After she posted a screenshot of one page of the documents on Twitter, hoping to draw attention, a German researcher on Xinjiang, Adrian Zenz, and another expert on the region reached out to her. They then put her in touch with a journalist, she said. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists later partnered with 17 other organizations, including The Times, to publish revelations on internment camps based on the 24-page set of documents.  That article came a week after The Times published a report based on 403 leaked pages that shed light on the origins and expansion of the crackdown in Xinjiang. The Times report said the source of its documents was a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity. In a statement Saturday, the consortium declined to say whether Ms. Abdulaheb was the source for its report. “ICIJ does not comment on its sources,” it said. It also reported that Mr. Zenz said Saturday that he did not give the documents to ICIJ. The two exposés sharpened international debate over the Chinese government’s intense crackdown across the region. Since 2017, the Chinese Communist Party has overseen a wave of mass detentions in Xinjiang, driving one million or more members of largely Muslim minority groups, especially Uighurs, into indoctrination camps intended to drastically weaken their Islamic beliefs and their attachment to the Uighur language, and make them loyal to the party. Initially, Chinese officials brushed away questions and reports about the detentions. But late last year, Beijing shifted its response: The Chinese authorities have since acknowledged the existence of the program, but defended the camps as job-training centers that teach the Mandarin Chinese language and practical skills, and that also warn people of the dangers of religious extremism.  In past decades, tensions between largely Muslim ethnic minorities and China’s Han ethnic majority in Xinjiang have occasionally erupted in violence. About half the region’s population is made up of minority groups, including 11.7 million Uighurs and 1.6 million Kazakhs. Both groups’ languages and cultures set them apart from Han people.  In 2009, the year Ms. Abdulaheb left China, ethnic rioting erupted in Urumqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang, and nearly 200 people were killed, most of them Han, according to government reports. China has cited that bloodshed and a succession of subsequent attacks on Han targets to defend its tough policies in Xinjiang. The leaks have challenged the official Chinese position by revealing the coercive underpinnings of the camps, and by hinting at dissent within the Chinese political system over the harsh policies in Xinjiang. Chinese government spokesmen and official media outlets have denounced the reports, calling them “fake news” and claiming they were part of a conspiracy to undermine stability in the region. In the Netherlands, Ms. Abdulaheb discovered that several of her social media accounts and a Hotmail account were hacked after she posted the tweet in June with the excerpt from the documents. She said she also got a message written in Uighur on Facebook Messenger that said, “If you don’t stop, you’ll end up cut into pieces in the black trash can in front of your doorway.” “That made me scared,” she said. Then in early September, an old friend of her ex-husband, someone who worked in a court in Xinjiang, contacted him after a long period of silence, Ms. Abdulaheb said. The friend invited Mr. Abibula to Dubai and offered to pay his expenses. He flew to Dubai on Sept. 9 and was met by his friend and several Chinese security officers who were ethnic Han, she said. After days of questioning Mr. Abibula, the officers handed him a USB stick and told him to put it into his ex-wife’s laptop, which would give them access to the computer’s contents, she said. Ms. Abdulaheb’s description of harassment and threats could not be independently verified. Still, her account fit a pattern that other Uighurs abroad have described. They have also recounted threats and pressure coming from China to remain silent or provide information to agents. Despite such threats, growing numbers of Uighurs and Kazakhs have spoken out, often using Twitter and Facebook to publicize family members in Xinjiang who have disappeared, possibly into re-education camps or prisons. A Uighur-American woman in the Washington area, Rushan Abbas, told The Times about family members who had gone missing after she had spoken publicly about the camps. In an interview Saturday, Mr. Zenz, the researcher, said that for Ms. Abdulaheb, “going public makes her safer” from potential retaliation. “So if something happens to her now, it will become a new story,” Mr. Zenz said. “Silence would have been so much worse.” Ms. Abdulaheb said she felt relieved to have revealed her identity.  “I have told everything,” she said. “My mind is calm now.” Elian Peltier and Claire Moses reported from London, and Edward Wong from Washington.']",Asiye Abdulaheb said she had helped spread documents exposing China’s detentions of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.
Charges Planned Against Netanyahu Aides in Submarine Graft Scandal,2019-12-05,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Two former close aides to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel are among those facing likely criminal charges in one of the country’s biggest corruption scandals yet, arising from the multibillion-dollar purchase of submarines and missile boats from Germany. A former chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu, David Sharan, is accused of accepting bribes from an Israeli agent for the shipbuilder, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. David Shimron, who has served as a personal lawyer and close confidant to Mr. Netanyahu and is also his second cousin, is accused of laundering money to help the shipbuilder’s agent, Michael Ganor, conceal his role in a separate financial transaction. The case is not related to last month’s indictment of Mr. Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, but adds to the cloud lingering over him and his political future. The charges against Mr. Netanyahu’s former aides are only tentative at this point. The two men — as well as the others facing the charges — are entitled to a hearing at which they can try to persuade prosecutors to drop or reduce the charges before an indictment is issued. They have all denied wrongdoing.  Unable to form a government after two inconclusive elections this year, Mr. Netanyahu is hanging onto office by a fraying thread. He is widely expected to force Israel to a third vote in March, despite growing calls for a leadership primary from within his own party, Likud. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned in the so-called submarine affair but was not named as a suspect. But with his personal lawyer and former chief of staff both facing charges, and another man he appointed as national security adviser also implicated, critics say that if Mr. Netanyahu did not know what was going on under his watch, he should have. “Serious indictments are served against those closest to Netanyahu, and he didn’t know?” Moshe Yaalon, a former defense minister under Mr. Netanyahu and now a political rival, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. Mr. Yaalon, a leader of the Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz, a former military chief, opposed the purchase of additional submarines while in office.  Pointing to Mr. Netanyahu’s approval of the sale of advanced German submarines to Egypt behind the backs of Israel’s defense minister and military chief of staff, Mr. Yaalon added: “A government headed by Blue and White would establish a commission of inquiry in order to expose the truth on subjects that have not been fully probed in general, and regarding Mr. Netanyahu in particular.”  He said questions he had posed to the attorney general more than a year ago remained unanswered. At the center of the submarine case is Mr. Ganor, an Israeli businessman whose old navy buddies held powerful positions.  One, Eliezer Marom, was the commander of the Israeli navy. Another, Avriel Bar-Yosef, was a deputy chief of the National Security Council, and was Mr. Netanyahu’s appointee to lead the council in 2016.  Prosecutors say the three conspired beginning in 2009 to help persuade ThyssenKrupp to name Mr. Ganor as its sales agent in Israel. Mr. Ganor earned millions of dollars in commissions on Israel’s purchases of vessels from ThyssenKrupp, prosecutors said, and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to Mr. Bar-Yosef and Mr. Marom. Mr. Ganor also bribed Mr. Sharan, prosecutors say, beginning in 2013, when Mr. Sharan was an aide to the Israeli minister of finance. The payments, which totaled about $35,000, continued for some two years after Mr. Sharan was named Mr. Netanyahu’s chief of staff. Mr. Ganor, who was a neighbor of Mr. Netanyahu’s in Caesarea, on Israel’s northern coast, turned state’s evidence in 2017 but changed his testimony earlier this year, and his cooperation agreement was canceled in May. He faces charges of bribery, money laundering and tax offenses. Mr. Marom was also named as a likely defendant. Prosecutors have not announced whether they intend to pursue charges against Mr. Bar-Yosef. Prosecutors appear to have retreated somewhat from the case that police had initially mustered against Mr. Shimron, Mr. Netanyahu’s cousin and lawyer, who also represented Mr. Ganor in his dealings with ThyssenKrupp. Investigators had recommended charging Mr. Shimron with bribery, saying he had taken nearly $75,000 in bribes as a “reward for success” after “opening doors” and influencing officials in favor of the vessel purchases. But the state prosecutor’s office on Thursday accused Mr. Shimron of what appeared to be an unrelated crime.  Mr. Ganor, prosecutors said, had been paid a $140,000 fee for helping an Israeli foundation identify new investments. But for unexplained reasons, Mr. Ganor did not want to be named in a brokerage agreement. At his request, prosecutors said, Mr. Shimron posed as the broker in exchange for 20 percent of Mr. Ganor’s fee. But in doing so, and to arrange that payment, the two men filed false documents with Bank Hapoalim, prosecutors said. Mr. Shimron belittled the charges against him.  “I’ve now received the indictment and reviewed it,” he said, according to Israeli public radio. “There are no submarines in it. There’s no bribery in it. There’s no fraud in it. So what is in it? A technical violation described with pomposity and with significant factual mistakes, which is why during the hearing that, too, will be tossed.”']","Indicted and embattled, Israel’s prime minister faces new calls for yet another corruption inquiry."
Spain’s ‘Big Brother’ Accused of Recording Sexual Assault and Making Victim Watch,2019-12-05,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — A contestant on a Spanish reality television show says she was sexually assaulted by another contestant while she was unconscious — an attack that was recorded. The show’s producers then forced her to watch and filmed her reaction. Two years later, it has all burst into the open, with the recent leak of a video in which the woman, then 24, can be seen sobbing after the show’s staff made her watch images of her own assault.  The video of her pained reaction has spread widely on social media, prompting a national backlash against the show, “Gran Hermano” — the Spanish version of “Big Brother” — and against what campaigners against sex crimes and harassment say is a culture that still does not take the problems seriously enough. The leaked video, shown in Spanish media and posted  online, shows the woman watching the recording, then weeping, pacing and burying her face in her hands. She begs to go talk to “her friends out there,” but an offscreen member of the show’s staff tells her that she cannot see her friends and should not tell anyone what happened. The entire episode — her being confronted with the video of the assault, her horrified response to it and her exchange with a staff member, who tells her to “relax” — all happened with the cameras rolling. The crew recorded the scene as if it were another part of the action, one of the interviews they conduct with contestants after key moments on the show. The leak coincided with news that an investigating judge had decided to pursue a criminal case, though so far no one has been indicted. Video of the alleged assault itself has not been seen publicly. But the unseen staff member in the leaked video said the male contestant, who had struck up a romantic relationship with the woman after meeting her on the show, offered her support, even as the camera tracked her pacing and crying.  The production company reported the man to the police hours later, and expelled him from the show. The broadcaster released a statement explaining that he had been ousted for “intolerable” behavior, but gave no details. The production staff has been broadly condemned for the failure to intervene, and for treating the young woman in a way that she and critics of the show say traumatized her. Last week, Zeppelin TV, the company that produces “Big Brother” in Spain, issued an apology to the woman and said it would put in place rules to avoid anything similar happening, notably by banning alcohol from the set. But the statement did not dampen public outrage, which has driven dozens of corporate sponsors to drop the show. “They allowed him to stay by my side many hours when they had sufficient proof to get him out immediately and then decide what to do with him,” the young woman, Carlota Prado, said in an interview with El Confidencial, the publication that first obtained the leaked video. The production staff allowed the man, José María López, who was also 24 at the time, “to laugh at my face by telling me that he looked after me,” she said. In the interview, she said she had resisted Mr. López’s advances in the presence of other contestants, and again in a bedroom before losing consciousness. “I cannot understand how the program allowed this,” she said. Before showing her the video of assault, she said, the production team gave no hint of what she was about to see, magnifying the shock. Given a choice, she said, she would not have viewed it. A representative of Mr. López could not be reached for comment. Gregorio Gómez Mata, the director of Alma, a group that fights gender-based violence, argued that anybody who was involved in the episode, down to each individual cameraman, should appear in court for failing to assist a person in danger. “You cannot watch a crime and do nothing about it,” he said. “Sadly, ‘Big Brother’ maintains high levels of audience, which tells us a lot about our society.” There have been mass street protests in Spain against some recent court rulings in sexual assault cases. Women’s groups have accused Spanish judges of paternalism and bias for demanding that victims demonstrate that they had fought back against their attackers. Last month, prosecutors announced that they would appeal a recent verdict in which five men were convicted of the sexual abuse of an unconscious 14-year-old girl in the town of Manresa, but not the more serious crime of rape, because the court ruled that they had not used violence.  Miguel Lorente, a former chief of a national government agency that deals with sexual violence, said the “Big Brother” case, like the one in Manresa, raised the question of whether Spain’s judiciary recognized obligations on the part of witnesses. One man was cleared of wrongdoing in the Manresa attack though he had watched it while masturbating. “Big Brother” throws strangers together in a confined space and records all of their interactions, hoping that the forced intimacy will create sparks, positive or negative. On the night of the incident, Ms. Prado had been drinking heavily at a party with other contestants, but apparently not Mr. López. In a video clip from the show, a man can be seen pulling at the waistband of her pants, stroking her hair and gripping her wrists, while she repeatedly seems to fend him off, before they walk off together. The next day, Ms. Prado, who said she had no memory of an assault, was made to watch the video of her alone with Mr. López. The viewing took place in the show’s “diary room,” where a contestant is interviewed on camera by someone who is not in the shot. A sobbing Ms. Prado was guaranteed by the off-camera person that nobody from the public would see the same images. She asked to confront Mr. López, but was told that she would not be able to speak with him again. The unseen person told her that the makers of “Big Brother” condemned what had taken place and would give her full psychological support, while offering her the possibility to leave the show “without any kind of penalty.” Ms. Prado requested medication to help her calm down, and said her heart was racing, but instead she was asked to sit on a sofa and “relax.” When she asked to speak to some of her friends outside the house, the person insisted that she had to wait, and that “this matter, for the sake of José María and you, for the sake of both, should not get out of here.” She paced the room, angry and crying: “What do I have to wait for? I won’t say anything, I understood what you have said.” Finally, a woman who identified herself as a member of the show’s casting department walked into the room and hugged Ms. Prado, who continued to sob. The producers took her to a hotel for a few days, after which she decided to rejoin the show.  Mediaset, the company that broadcasts “Big Brother” in Spain, issued a statement recently accusing its main rival media group in Spain of using the case of Ms. Prado to fuel a “denigratory campaign” against the show.  When the season that featured Ms. Prado ended, in December 2017, the show switched to featuring only celebrity contestants rather than ordinary people. Zeppelin did not say whether the change was prompted by what had happened to Ms. Prado.  “What seems to have failed completely is putting themselves in the place of the victim,” said Mr. Lorente, the former government official. He said that the case showed that “Spain has put in place the laws, but we still live in a far too permissive society.”']","A former contestant on the reality show says its staff stood by as she was sexually assaulted while unconscious, then filmed her emotional reaction to a video of the assault.

"French Strike Aims to Save an Envied, but Convoluted, Approach to Pensions",2019-12-07,By Liz Alderman,"['PARIS — Stéphane Vardon has worked as a conductor on France’s high-speed and suburban rail network for 20 years. It is hard work, he says, and he’d like to retire before he turns 58, a privilege he now fears President Emmanuel Macron is going to strip away. So this week, when nearly one million French citizens demonstrated nationwide to protect pension benefits that are the envy of much of the world, Mr. Vardon, 46, was among them, marching through the streets of Paris. “People will have to work longer and have less money for their retirement,” said Mr. Vardon, citing a common fear of Mr. Macron’s plans. “Macron isn’t close to the people. We know he won’t do anything for the workers.’’  While France’s official retirement age may be 62, the actual age varies widely across the country’s labyrinthine system. Train drivers can retire at 52, public electric and gas workers at 57, and members of the national ballet, who start dancing at a very young age, as early as age 42. That is to name just a few of the stark differences. It is this sheer complexity that Mr. Macron has vowed to untangle, aiming to standardize 42 different public and private pension schemes into one state-managed plan. At stake in the continuing standoff — much of France remained shutdown on Friday — is nothing less than the future of the country’s vaunted social safety net.  Elected in 2017, Mr. Macron has faced fierce strikes and street protests before as part of his attempts to add dynamism to France’s economy and make it more business friendly. But the pension overhaul is his biggest and most daunting test yet.  Unions are calling for another nationwide demonstration Tuesday, just before the government is scheduled to unveil fresh details of the pension overhaul. The transport strikes that incapacitated France this week have now been prolonged through early next week. As Mr. Macron moves to overhaul the pension system, it is precisely workers like Mr. Vardon — those with the most generous ‘‘special schemes’’ — that he would like to address. The country’s postwar retirement system was founded by Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who was intent on establishing a social safety net in 1946 following the liberation of France.  Amid the postwar tumult, he bowed to demands by France’s mainly Communist-led unions to let different professions control their pension plans.  Instead of a centralized system, railway workers oversaw their retirement system, as did sailors, lawyers, notaries, teachers and, eventually, even ballet dancers and actors. Because of the arduous nature of some professions, workers could retire early, a framework that persists today.  Mr. Macron has called the tangle outdated, unfair and unsustainable. France spends a whopping 14 percent of its gross domestic product on the pension system, more than almost any European country.  The system is staring at a potential deficit of 19 billion euros by 2025 if no action is taken, according to a landmark report issued by France’s pension czar, Jean-Paul Delevoye.  So Mr. Macron says he wants to merge the disparate systems, public and private, into one state-managed system by 2025.  He also wants to keep the deficit from growing, which Patrick Artus, chief economist of Paris-based Natixis bank, said could be achieved if every worker works at least another six months before retiring. Whether Mr. Macron can succeed in his plans is an open question. No French president has managed to achieve a radical overhaul of pensions. Mr. Macron says he isn’t seeking to reduce France’s pension spending — a point the government hopes will placate protesters.  Nonetheless, the changes he has proposed could alleviate the burden of some of the most generous pensions, which falls heavily on the government. To get there, Mr. Macron plans to pivot to a centrally managed points-based system similar to one used in Sweden, where workers accumulate points over the course of their careers and cash them in.  Mr. Macron says the system would be simpler and fairer, and would create better funding security for pensions as the population ages. Currently, the public pension fund is a pay as you go system that works like a group insurance, with workers and employers paying contributions from their income.  Pension benefits are currently calculated, in the private sector, based on a worker’s 25 highest earning years, and in the public sector on the last six months, when workers are likely to be at the height of their earning power.  Full pension benefits are earned after 41 to 43 years of contributions, depending on when workers were born, but workers can retire earlier, although those who do won’t get full benefits. All workers are also required to pay into supplementary pension schemes to complement public pensions, which pay retirees an average of around 75 percent of pretax earnings — among the most generous in Europe, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The state would remain the main guarantor of pensions, continuing to provide workers with a safety net that is unheard-of in the United States, where about half of Americans have no access to retirement savings plans, and have little or nothing saved for retirement. French unions say Mr. Macron’s plan is little more than smoke and mirrors and will benefit private-sector workers at the expense of teachers, railway workers, nurses, and other public-sector employees.  By valuing pensions on a lifetime of work, instead of the last six months, those in the public sector fear they will see their pensions slashed. Mr. Vardon, the conductor, is among those worried about taking a hit. His base salary of 1,800 euros a month is enough for a decent pension under the current scheme.  But under the points system, his retirement check calculation would include the lower salaries he earned when he started working 20 years ago, so he’ll get less. “It won’t be enough to have a retirement where I can live well,” he said. As things stand, Mr. Vardon would like to retire at age 57 and a half, the threshold permitted by the national railway scheme.  In reality, he said, he will probably need to work until age 62 to reap his full pension. Mr. Macron’s changes could force him to work even longer — a thought that fills him with dread. “We have difficult working conditions,” said Mr. Vardon, who assists passengers and manages work crews while maneuvering constantly on his feet as he crisscrosses the country at high speeds.  “We don’t eat at normal hours, we have short nights of sleep, which means that I am more tired and my body doesn’t have time to adapt,’’ he said. ‘‘I will age faster than someone who had a regular job Monday to Friday from nine to five.”  “Many of my colleagues died between the ages of 60 and 65,” he added, “So I’m worried I won’t make it.” Economists agree that the biggest winners are likely to be private-sector employees. Because pension payments under the point system would be indexed to France’s nominal gross domestic product, private-sector workers will have their pensions revalued and likely revised up, said Mr. Artus. “There will be winners and losers,” Mr. Artus said. While those losing out will face a painful transition, France’s overall pension system will be sounder in the long run, because a points system will make it easier to maintain balanced finances, he added. A recent poll by Elabe, a French polling agency, shows that over half of French people are concerned the current pensions system isn’t sustainable. Still, the political challenges to streamlining it remain enormous. The demonstrations are likely to go on as long as the French fear their pensions might suffer or they will have to work longer under any new system. French presidents have tended to back down from reform efforts in the past in the face of fierce public resistance. Mr. Vardon is among thousands who have vowed to continue the fight. While the demonstrations may look raucous to the outside world, “We want people to live without having to work longer to have a retirement,” he said. “Yes, we have a good system, but we think our system should be a model,” he added. “It allows people who have accidents, who are poor, who didn’t have any luck in life, to climb the social ladder and to continue — after a long career — to live, to feed themselves, to take a well deserved rest.”  “It’s a shame that other countries don’t have this,” he said.

"Building Collapse in Nairobi Leaves at Least Four Dead, 29 Injured",2019-12-06,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — At least four people were dead and 29 injured after a six-story residential building collapsed in the Kenyan capital on Friday after weeks of heavy rains, a government official said.  Rescuers were still searching for survivors as the night wore on, said the official, Wilson Njenga, the Nairobi regional commissioner. It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the collapse of the building. Kenya has been the site of several disastrous building collapses in recent years, leading commentators to blame the government for failing to enforce regulations and conduct inspections.  But heavy downpours might also have played a role in the collapse on Friday. The annual “short rains” in Kenya which usually last from October to December, have been exceptionally heavy this year.  At least 132 people have been killed and more than 160,000 others have been affected by flooding in 31 out of Kenya’s 47 counties, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  Th six-story building in Nairobi, located in the southeast neighborhood of Embakasi, housed nearly two dozen families and crumpled at about 9 a.m., according to Peter Abwao, a spokesman for Kenya Red Cross.  Videos and images from the scene, broadcast over local television and shared on social media, showed emergency teams conducting rescue operations next to the rubble. Large crowds gathered in the area, watching the teams working in the mud caused by the heavy rainfall.  On Tuesday, Kenya’s disaster agency warned of increasing rainfall and floods this week in cities including Nairobi. Rain or not, it isn’t the first time a building gave way in Kenya either because of poor structural design or sloppy construction. In September, a school collapse in Nairobi killed seven students and injured many more. In 2015, 51 people were killed after a building crumbled following heavy rains.

General Strike in France Challenges Macron’s Latest Ambition for Change,2019-12-05,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — The streets of French cities were filled with anti-government demonstrators, tear gas and police officers on Thursday as Emmanuel Macron again faced what has become an emblem of his presidency: social unrest. This time it was a general strike over his plans to overhaul the country’s pension system. Much of the country came to a halt as transport workers went on a strike that could last into next week. By some estimates nearly half a million took part nationwide in the demonstrations. Trains, subways and buses were canceled, many schools were closed, and thousands were forced to stay home from work across the country. In Paris, smoke billowed from the Place de la République and the wide Boulevard de Magenta was packed shoulder-to-shoulder with unionists furious with Mr. Macron. In Rennes, protesters smashed store windows; in Nantes, the riot police pushed the crowds back with tear gas; in Lyon, scuffles broke out between the police and demonstrators. But behind the anger was the much-contested figure of the president himself, a former investment banker who was elected two and half years ago promising to shake up a secure but sclerotic French system deemed too unfriendly to business, growth and job creation.  His latest ambition — to merge France’s complex of 42 different generous pension schemes into one state-managed system — scares fellow citizens. And his sometimes imperious personal style continues to grate on many.  On Thursday, it was Mr. Macron who united their popular anger once again, exactly as he did a year ago when members of the protest movement known as the Yellow Vests guillotined him in effigy on the country’s roundabouts.  Analysts pointed out that Thursday’s protests completed the circle of anger against Mr. Macron begun last year by the Yellow Vests.  The Yellow Vests could only demonstrate on Saturdays because, marginally employed, they could not risk their jobs. On Thursday, it was the unionized employed — teachers, hospital workers, some civil servants — who came out, who weren’t risking employment, but who were expressing many of the same anxieties. “The government has inflamed unease with this reform. It is the other France that is revolting today,” said the economist Daniel Cohen of France’s top-ranked École Normale Supérieure. “Last year it was the cutoff France, and this year it’s the unions, the teachers.” And that junction — two anxious parts of the nation coming together in anger — spells big trouble for Mr. Macron’s government. Indeed, some of the former Yellow Vests demonstrated with the unionists Thursday, though they had held them at arms length all through their own protests last year. Mr. Macron might be wishing he could have stayed at the NATO gathering in London that ended Wednesday. There, he was in the posture that appears to suit him well, at least in his own eyes: leader of Europe, and the only continental leader who can stand up to President Trump. His curt dismissal of Mr. Trump — “Let’s be serious” — has already become an iconic moment in the marginalization of the American president as a considered interlocutor on the world stage. In the past Mr. Macron’s advisers frequently attempted to play up the supposed similarities between the two men — both outsiders, both non-politicians who defied the odds — to show that they could find common ground.  On Thursday, they had something else in common. Both Mr. Macron and Mr. Trump returned home to serious messes. His fellow European leaders have ceded first place to Mr. Macron nearly by default, even if he irritates them by pushing unilateral initiatives he appears convinced are absolutely right. The problem for Mr. Macron is that this approach irritates his fellow citizens as well. That friction has developed as a serious obstacle to his will to change France, promised in the campaign manifesto he entitled Revolution two years ago. He is now less popular in his homeland than Mr. Trump in his. At the Élysée Palace on Thursday, seat of the French presidency, a senior official said Mr. Macron was “calm and determined” in the face of the strike. That was not the mood on the street. Today, much of the anger directed at the French president in the crowds coursing through the streets was nearly personal.  Benoît Martin, a leading union official with the leftist CGT, which is leading the charge on the strike, framed it as all about Mr. Macron himself. “It expresses a sort of resistance to Macron’s power,” Mr. Martin said. True, Mr. Macron’s plans by themselves spark fear in a nervous France demanding more security, not less. The current pension system is one of the world’s most protective, for all its flaws. Many French are asking why a plan of uncertain contours and outcomes should be substituted for it. But Mr. Macron argues that the current byzantine system is both unaffordable and unfair. It could be headed for a deficit of about $19 billion, and its disparities allow workers in some sectors to retire years ahead of others.  While Mr. Macron is not proposing to spend less on pensions or to make people retire later, he aims to simplify the system, raising fears that he will reshuffle its winners and losers. The pension plan is not the first of Mr. Macron’s reforms to face resistance. His changes to the status of the country’s railway workers and revamping of France’s voluminous labor code met similarly fierce protests on the street.  Some of those changes made it easier to hire and fire workers and have helped nudge down a stubborn unemployment rate that once hovered around 10 percent to about 8.4 percent this year. Yet for many French the perceived benefits don’t outweigh the feeling of insecurity they have introduced. Beyond that there is striking disaffection with the way Mr. Macron goes about presenting himself and his ideas. He talks to the French, often at great length and in stupendous detail. But it doesn’t reassure them. Marc Veslin, 56, and Ludovic Varlet, 52, hospital workers demonstrating near the Place de la République, said they did not trust Mr. Macron. He hadn’t explained his pension reform plan at all. “We have nothing, no information,” Mr. Veslin said. Mr. Varlet said he was particularly angry with Mr. Macron. “It’s him and everything he represents,” he said, adding: “Finance is governing.” Mr. Varlet chimed in: “It was the best system in the world. And they are about to destroy it.” Philippe Lauberthe, a railway worker who joined the demonstration called Mr. Macron “the president of curt little phrases,” referring to Mr. Macron’s early penchant, since repressed, for uttering words seen as dismissive by his fellow citizens. “Macron isn’t taking into account the expectations of the French,” said a teacher who would only give her name as Christine. “He is completely out to lunch.” She added, speaking of his government: “They don’t communicate enough with people.” The sentiment was widely expressed on the streets on Thursday. “This government is rotten,’’ said Sophie Prevost, a magazine editor, lighting a cigarette as she left the Châtelet train station. ‘‘They think only of numbers, not of people.” Mr. Cohen, the economist, has argued that Mr. Macron’s large spate of financial concessions to the Yellow Vests last year — nearly $19 billion in tax breaks and income supplements — was not sufficient to deal with the more profound underlying problem in France. The concessions added about $900 in purchasing power to working and middle-class households. But that was not enough. Thursday’s demonstrations may have offered additional proof. “The social tissue of the working classes is very frayed,” said Mr. Cohen. “There’s an economic and anthropological insecurity.”  The government, he added, “has a blanket that’s too short.” Pulling it up — in tax cuts last year to satisfy the Yellow Vests — only added to the chill of those dependent on public spending, like the people demonstrating Thursday. Mr. Macron appeared out of step: on the European stage, he is a liberal democrat in a world of mounting populism, and at home he is “profoundly out of step, in respect to populations that are demanding more protection,” said Mr. Cohen. As with the Yellow Vest protests last year, much will depend on the battle for public opinion. The government was forced to listen, and keep a check on police repression, for as long as there was popular support for that movement. When that support dwindled toward 50 percent, the government shut its ears and unleashed the police. Polls released Thursday, before the beginning of the strike, showed popular support for it at close to 70 percent.  “What will play for Emmanuel Macron and Edouard Philippe,” his prime minister, “is public opinion,” said Mr. Garrigues, the political historian. “They’re playing on the degeneration of the movement in public opinion,” as with the Yellow Vests, he said. But playing against that is the solitary nature of power as conceived by Mr. Macron himself.  “The nature of his movement is that it is constructed around one man,’’ Mr. Garrigues said. ‘‘So there’s very little room to maneuver.”  Reporting was contributed by Aurelien Breeden and Liz Alderman in Paris, and by Elian Peltier in London.

Japan Plans to Spend $120 Billion to Stimulate Slowing Economy,2019-12-05,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — Japan will spend nearly $120 billion to stimulate its slowing economy and to help some of the areas worst affected by Typhoon Hagibis, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Thursday. The new spending plan is aimed at addressing a slew of economic challenges facing Japan’s longtime leader, who has built his reputation on the country’s stronger growth after years of stagnation.  But the stimulus package, if passed, would continue Japan’s cycle of borrowing and spending to stoke growth and pay for the country’s expanding social welfare costs to support a rapidly aging population. The country already has the biggest debt load in the developed world relative to the size of its economy.  Mr. Abe’s administration has pledged to reverse the borrowing trend. Just two months ago the government raised the country’s consumption tax to help shore up the country’s finances, only to see retail sales slump. In announcing the much-anticipated package of more than 13 trillion yen, Mr. Abe told a meeting of his governing Liberal Democratic Party that the economic measures were meant to “overcome downside risks” and help the country “maintain or enhance economic viability” after the 2020 Olympics, which Tokyo will host next summer. Japan has recently struggled as a weakening global economy and trade rifts have taken the air out of the country’s recovery. A slowdown in demand from China, a major consumer of Japanese-made assembly line equipment, has already curtailed Japan’s growth, which fell below economists’ expectations in the third quarter. The country has also recently felt the effects of a political spat with South Korea that has led Koreans to boycott purchases of products like Japanese beer and severely curtail tourism to Japan. The typhoon in October, the worst to hit the country in 50 years, also exposed the need for new infrastructure to help protect the country against increasingly menacing storms and flooding in the era of climate change. More broadly, Japan faces difficult long-term economic challenges. Its population is aging, and its female labor force continues to suffer from deep underemployment. Some economists have argued that Japan needs more substantial structural changes to lift its economy over the longer term. The government expects the stimulus package to lift private-sector spending by up to an additional 13 trillion yen. The public portion of the stimulus package will be financed by government bonds and the country’s general account. Some economists said the package was smaller than expected. “Even though the total amount seems to be big, the actual amount that the central government is injecting is not so big,” said Takuya Hoshino, deputy chief economist at Daiichi Life Research Institute. “This will not be much of a power boost to the economy as the budget is not increased from the previous year.” According to NHK, the public broadcaster, the package includes spending to reinforce riverbanks and create improved hazard maps to prepare for natural disasters, along with support for exports of agricultural and marine products. The government also plans to hire workers who were never able to get a foothold in the full-time labor force during Japan’s “lost decade” of the 1990s. And it will provide subsidies to aging drivers to install safety equipment such as automatic brakes in their cars to help make them safer to drive. “It makes sense in almost every regard,” said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management in Tokyo. “The amount is large but not too large. I don’t think anyone is going to think this is profligate spending.” He added: “Improving the aging infrastructure and preventing loss of life from typhoon damage is money well spent.” The stimulus announced Thursday in Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, is one of its largest allocations of public funds to jump-start its economy. The spending will push up Japan’s debt level, which is currently more than two and a half times the nation’s total annual economic output and the largest among 188 countries. In October, the government increased a consumption tax on a wide variety of goods and services to 10 percent from 8 percent in part to help pay down that enormous debt as well as to pay ballooning welfare costs that support Japan’s rapidly aging population. By issuing government bonds, Japan could be derailing its plan to bring down its debt at a time when the economy was still growing, albeit slowly, said Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research. “The economy is not that bad at this point,” Mr. Saito. “There are risks of course but I am not sure if fiscal spending is appropriate at this time.” Makiko Inoue, Hisako Ueno and Eimi Yamamitsu contributed reporting.']",Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced the spending as the country’s economy has slowed because of reduced demand from China and tensions with South Korea.
‘The Amazon Is Completely Lawless’: The Rainforest After Bolsonaro’s First Year,2019-12-05,By Victor Moriyama and Matt Sandy,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — When the smoke cleared, the Amazon could breathe easy again. For months, black clouds had hung over the rainforest as work crews burned and chain-sawed through it. Now the rainy season had arrived, offering a respite to the jungle and a clearer view of the damage to the world. The picture that emerged was anything but reassuring: Brazil’s space agency reported that in one year, more than 3,700 square miles of the Amazon had been razed — a swath of jungle nearly the size of Lebanon torn from the world’s largest rainforest. It was the highest loss in Brazilian rainforest in a decade, and stark evidence of just how badly the Amazon, an important buffer against global warming, has fared in Brazil’s first year under President Jair Bolsonaro.  He has vowed to open the rainforest to industry and scale back its protections, and his government has followed through, cutting funds and staffing to weaken the enforcement of environmental laws. In the absence of federal agents, waves of loggers, ranchers and miners moved in, emboldened by the president and eager to satisfy global demand.  Deforestation soared, up almost 30 percent from the year before.  “It confirms the Amazon is completely lawless,” Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist with the University of São Paulo, said of the data. “The environmental criminals feel more and more empowered.” He warned that the Amazon may soon cross a tipping point and begin to self-destruct. “Law enforcement has reached its minimum effectiveness in a decade,” he said. “It is a worrying warning for the future.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s government has made some nods to combating illegal clear-cutting, but the president has reaffirmed his longstanding position of disdain toward conservation work. He once said that Brazil’s environmental policy was “suffocating the country”; he vowed on the campaign trail that not “a square centimeter” of land would be designated for Indigenous people; and last month he brushed aside official data about deforestation. His stance has been widely noted on the Amazon frontier, where the rainforest is transformed into land for cattle, soybeans and other crops in a process that can be murky, sometimes illegal and frequently violent.  “Deforestation and fires have always been a problem, but this is the first time it has happened thanks to the discourse and activities of the federal government,” said Marina Silva, who as environment minister in the mid-2000s cracked down on illegal activity in the Amazon, contributing to an 83 percent fall in deforestation from 2004 to 2012. Around 2014, Brazil started sliding into a deep recession, and deforestation began to rise as ranchers and loggers searched for new land to exploit. The Amazon, relied on for centuries for rubber trees, minerals and fertile land, was the obvious place to go. Agribusiness, always a force in Brazil, gained even more economic and political power: It now represents nearly a quarter of the country’s G.D.P., and the Amazon region supports soybean farms, gold and iron ore mines and ranches holding more than 50 million cattle. These industries found an ally in Mr. Bolsonaro, a far-right, pro-business lawmaker before he shot to the presidency last year. His government, Ms. Silva said, “is not fighting to preserve environmental governance.”  Deforestation began to rise before Mr. Bolsonaro took office in January. By the height of the dry season in July and August, some experts feared that criminal loggers and ranchers, who use fire to prepare land for crops and pasture, were clearing the Amazon with impunity.  Their fires drew international attention, especially as images spread online of jungle blazes, charred trees and the smoke-darkened sky over Brazil’s largest city, São Paulo, 1,800 miles southeast of the rainforest. More than 80,000 fires were detected since the start of the year, according to government data. The fires turned into a major diplomatic crisis for Mr. Bolsonaro, pitting him against a global backlash of politicians, celebrities and popular opinion. France threatened to block a major trade deal, and Norway and Germany halted donations to protect the rainforest. After initially remaining defiant, Mr. Bolsonaro mobilized the military to tackle the flames and issued a decree banning fires in the Amazon for 60 days.  The furor reached such a pitch that Brazil’s businesses became worried about the potential impact. “Did we have our image harmed? Yes. Can we recover it? Yes. The government has to align its discourse to what the world wants,” said Blairo Maggi, a billionaire soybean producer and former agriculture minister known as the Soy King. “The farmers, associations and industry will have to redo what has been lost,” he said. “We retreated 10 steps; we will have to work to get back to where we were.” The people who work the land have expressed conflicting feelings about the deforestation. For some, the fires are a dual threat, spewing dangerous smoke and destroying a forest that has always provided a livelihood. For others, the fires create much-needed jobs, all the more valuable amid Brazil’s sluggish economy. The push into the Amazon has also been driven by demand from abroad. Every year, Brazil exports nearly 15 million tons of soy, much of it to China, and more than $6 billion worth of beef — more than any other country in history. Cattle ranches account for up to 80 percent of deforested land in the Amazon, according to the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Major beef and soy firms have been fined millions for buying commodities sourced from illegally deforested land, but such rules have proved difficult to enforce. Last week, the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said that the authorities needed a new strategy to stop illegal logging and mining, but he has not outlined a plan. And despite the more conciliatory tone taken by Mr. Salles and businessmen like Mr. Maggi, Mr. Bolsonaro has again voiced an aggressive, nationalistic view of the Amazon, describing the rainforest as a resource to be exploited.  Last week, he falsely accused the actor Leonardo DiCaprio of bankrolling fires in the Amazon, and for months he has also dismissed Indigenous people’s concerns about increasing invasions of protected land by loggers and miners, even as Indigenous groups have pleaded with the government for protection from growing violence. Many environmentalists directly blame Mr. Bolsonaro for the increase in deforestation, citing his firing of key officials at the main environmental regulator, IBAMA, and his refusal to endorse anti-logging operations. “If the federal government does not profoundly change its stance on the issue,” said Mauricio Voivodic, the executive director of WWF Brasil, deforestation “will grow even more next year, causing the country to go back 30 years in terms of protecting the Amazon.” The Amazon’s future may depend on whether that happens, with serious implications for global warming.  The rainforest stores a huge volume of carbon dioxide, which is unleashed through the fires. From January through July, deforestation and fires in the Brazilian Amazon released between 115 and 155 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions — roughly the total for the state of North Carolina — according to an analysis by the Woods Hole Research Center and IPAM-Amazônia.  “Deforestation data for the last three months also shows a very sharp increase,” said Mr. Nobre, the climate scientist. Scientists also warn that decades of destruction have brought the forest close to a tipping point, in which lower rainfall and longer dry seasons would turn most of it into savanna. According to research by Mr. Nobre, the tipping point will likely be reached at 20 to 25 percent of deforestation across the Amazon basin — or even sooner, depending on the rate of climate change. There is no accurate measure of deforestation across the nine countries containing the Amazon, but many researchers believe about 17 percent of the forest has been lost already. Whether this year’s figures represent an acceleration of that process or an exception to the trend will only become evident next summer, when the dry season returns. Speaking to reporters last month, Mr. Bolsonaro predicted smoke would be back with it. “Deforestation and fires will never end,” he said. “It’s cultural.” ']",
"Visiting Auschwitz, Merkel Warns Against Danger to Liberal Democracy",2019-12-06,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — At a time of rising nationalist and authoritarian movements, Angela Merkel  on Friday made her first visit as Germany’s chancellor to Europe’s most potent symbol of extremism, the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, and warned that liberal democracy must be protected against “a very dangerous historical revisionism.” Ms. Merkel, who has come to be seen as one of the world’s leading defenders of tolerant, democratic ideals, stepped into the Nazi camp in southern Poland where more than a million people, most of them Jews, were murdered. On a frosty morning, she and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki walked beneath the wrought-iron gateway with its infamous promise, “Arbeit Macht Frei,” or “Work Sets You Free.” Her visit marked a decade since the founding of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation to preserve the site as a memorial for future generations. But as anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism strain societies across Europe, and a growing number of Germans question their country’s postwar culture of remembrance and atonement for Nazi crimes, the symbolism of her presence at the site  resonated beyond the anniversary. After touring a laboratory that preserves artifacts like the piles of shoes, suitcases and human hair that she viewed in the camp’s museum, the chancellor addressed Germany’s “enduring responsibility” to acknowledge its history as the perpetrator of the Holocaust and war crimes.  “Auschwitz was a German death camp, run by Germans,” Ms. Merkel said, stressing the importance of preserving evidence of those offenses as a warning to future generations of the danger of ethnic hatred. “We Germans owe it to the victims and we owe it to ourselves to keep alive the memory of the crimes committed, to identify the perpetrators and to commemorate the victims in a dignified manner,” Ms. Merkel said. “This is not open to negotiation. It is an integral part and will forever be an integral part of our identity.” In the past year, there has been a repeated chipping away at Germany’s pledge after World War II not to repeat the crimes of the Nazis, who systematically killed six million Jews and several million others — including Slavs, Roma and disabled people — in addition to the millions who died in the war they waged.  German officials said hate crimes targeting Jews rose 10 percent last year, to 1,646, while physical attacks increased by more than a third, to 62, in the same time period. In May, the government official tasked with combating anti-Semitism said that Jews should not wear their skullcaps in public, sparking a debate about the threats posed to Germany’s revived Jewish community. Those fears materialized on Oct. 9, when a German armed with a gun and spouting anti-Semitic tropes attacked a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle.  Only a locked door prevented him from entering and harming the congregants on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. But he killed two people and wounded two others in a rampage that rattled the country and raised questions about modern Germany’s ability to protect Jewish life. Ms. Merkel condemned the attack at the time as “a disgrace for our country,” but many other German politicians pointed the blame squarely at the country’s strongest opposition party, the Alternative for Germany, or AfD. The far-right party’s leaders have repeatedly used language that echoes the racist rhetoric of the 1930s and questions the national narrative of vigilance against extremism and xenophobia.  On Friday, Ms. Merkel called on political leaders to remain committed to human dignity, civil liberties and democracy, which she called “very vulnerable and fragile, indeed.”  “These days, this is more than just rhetoric,” she said. “These days, it is important that we state this in an unequivocal manner, because what we are experiencing of late is an alarming level of racism, increasing intolerance, a wave of hate crimes.”  “We are witnessing and experiencing an attack on the fundamental values of liberal democracy,” Ms. Merkel said, “and a very dangerous historical revisionism that serves a hostility that is directed against specific groups.” On the eve of her visit, Ms. Merkel said that Germany would contribute 60 million euros, or $66 million, to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, in addition to the $80.5 million it has given over the past decade. The United States has contributed $15 million to the endowment, which provides financial support for the conservation of the crumbling barracks and other elements of the former camp. The German government also agreed on Thursday to cover the cost of providing security to synagogues across the country, including those beyond the larger cities where it is common to see police officers standing guard outside of Jewish institutions.  Jan. 27 will mark 75 years since Soviet soldiers liberated Auschwitz, and with the passage of time, the number of survivors with firsthand memories of Nazi  horrors is dwindling fast. That has opened the door for a new generation of people on the far right to question Germany’s 20th century history. . Ms. Merkel’s acknowledgment of German responsibility for the death camp was important to Polish officials who have attempted to outlaw any suggestion of Polish complicity in the Holocaust and bristle at any reference to Auschwitz as a Polish camp. The Germans established the camp after invading Poland in 1939. After a complaint from Mr. Morawiecki, Netflix recently amended maps shown in the new documentary series, “The Devil Next Door,”  which showed Nazi extermination camps as being located in Poland. Ms. Merkel has gone to other concentration camps during her 14 years in power, including Buchenwald and Dachau, which are in Germany, but she until Friday she had not visited Auschwitz. Chancellor Helmut Kohl went to Auschwitz in 1989 and 1995, and Helmut Schmidt was the first German leader to do so, in 1977.']","Stressing that it was “a German death camp, run by Germans,” Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of the threat posed by revisionist history and rising hatred."
Anti-Semitic Imagery Could Cost Belgian Carnival Its UNESCO Status,2019-12-05,By Claire Moses,"['The city of Aalst, Belgium, faces the prospect of an unheard-of demotion: A decade after declaring its Carnival celebrations a valued cultural expression, UNESCO could revoke that designation over anti-Semitic imagery that has been part of the revelry. So the city’s mayor, Christoph D’Haese, has tried to beat UNESCO to the punch. In a classic “you can’t fire me — I quit” moment, he sent the agency a letter on Tuesday, renouncing Aalst’s place on the list before it could be kicked off. The mayor’s office does not have the authority to leave the agency’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list of its own accord, and such a request would have to come from Belgium’s UNESCO delegation, a spokeswoman for the international group said. The committee in charge of the list plans to consider whether to remove Aalst at a meeting on Dec. 12 in Bogotá, Colombia, said the spokeswoman, Aurelia du Vignau. “It’s still in the hands of the committee,” she said. The mayor’s action “doesn’t really change anything.” UNESCO has labeled more than 500 activities and traditions as cultural heritage, but it has never rescinded the honor, making the next steps uncertain. Aalst, northwest of Brussels, has long been known for its Carnival celebrations. But in its annual parade early this year, one float carried two giant figures of Orthodox Jews with side curls and grotesquely large noses, along with rats and bags of money.  Another Carnival group dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan — in order, they said, to satirize a far-right city councilor in a nearby town. Images of the event quickly spread, leading to accusations of bigotry and historical ignorance. Some critics began an international campaign to push UNESCO, the United Nations cultural organization, to withdraw its official recognition of the Aalst Carnival, one of Europe’s largest. The controversy was nothing new for Aalst. In 2013, a group of people took part in the Carnival parade wearing Nazi SS uniforms, marching alongside a float evoking the trains that ferried Jews to their deaths and carrying what appeared to be cans of the poison gas used in death camps. In anticipation of the 2020 carnival, hats adorned with side curls and hooked noses are for sale in the city. There is no established procedure for removing an item from the UNESCO list, Jorijn Neyrinck, an expert on intangible heritage and a member of the Flemish UNESCO commission, told a Belgian newspaper. On the other hand, there is no procedure for leaving the list voluntarily either. Mr. D’Haese, the mayor, said that a decision to remove Aalst would be politicized, and he predicted that the matter would not receive a fair hearing. “We’ve about had it in Aalst with the fact that we are being painted as anti-Semitic or racist on the international stage,” he said on a talk show on Belgian television on Monday night. “We don’t want to be the stage for a racist or anti-Semitic debate about a folk festival that connects people.” Two Dutch actresses, Carice van Houten and Halina Reijn, who were supposed to take part in the same talk show, canceled their appearances, citing the Carnival’s anti-Semitism. Aalst’s parade, which takes place on the Sunday before Lent, is the pinnacle of a three-day feast. It was added to UNESCO’s list in 2010. UNIA, an independent antidiscrimination group in Belgium, investigated the dispute. “We decided that the float was anti-Semitic,” said Bram Sebrechts, a spokesman for UNIA. But he said the group had concluded that the float did not violate the law because its specific goal was not to spread anti-Semitic beliefs, nor was it meant to incite violence against Jews. “You have to look at it in the specific context of Carnival,” he said. During Carnival, he said, “norms and values are turned on their heads.” He said that members of the Carnival committee had visited a Holocaust museum this fall, while a delegation of Jewish Belgians went to the Carnival museum. It went well, he said, adding that the parties were “on speaking terms.” André Gantman, a Jewish city councilman in Antwerp who belongs to the same political party as Mr. D’Haese, said that the resemblance between the parade float and 1930s Nazi imagery of Jews was eerily similar. “No lessons have been learned from history,” said Mr. Gantman, whose grandfather died in Auschwitz. Mr. D’Haese said on Monday night that the dispute was in part about whether the authorities should be allowed to regulate humor. “I have respect for what happened historically,” he said, adding, “In this discussion, context is everything.”']","As the United Nations agency considers whether to rescind the cultural heritage designation, a city’s mayor has tried to renounce the honor."
Protesters Killed and Cleric’s House Bombed in Deepening Iraqi Chaos,2019-12-07,By Falih Hassan and Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — Unknown assailants killed a dozen unarmed anti-government protesters in the Iraqi capital in an attack the president blamed on criminal gangs, and an unmanned drone bombed the home of a prominent Shiite cleric who has been a major supporter of the protest movement.  The bombing of the cleric Moktada al-Sadr’s home in the southern city of Najaf came a few hours after the overnight attack on the protesters, who were in a building where many supporters of Mr. al-Sadr have been gathering to stage demonstrations demanding a change in the system of government, the elimination of corruption and a curbing of Iran’s influence on the country. No one was injured in the Najaf bombing on Mr. al-Sadr’s home. Lethal assaults on protesters by unknown gunmen have been rare since the protests began more than two months ago. And the back-to-back attacks raised tensions between the Iraqi security forces and the protesters.  “The people of Iraq are at a boiling point,” said Sa’ad Maye al-Hilfi, a member of Parliament’s Defense and Security Committee, which planned to hold an emergency meeting on Sunday.  No one claimed responsibility for the violence, and with the country’s security forces pulled in different directions, it was not clear who, if anyone, could have ordered it. President Barham Salih has been acting temporarily as the head of state since the prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, resigned last month, and Parliament has yet to name a replacement. The prime minister is the commander in chief, and in the absence of his leadership, it is unclear who exactly is in charge or determining the security forces’ priorities.   Some of the forces are under the command of the Defense Ministry, others are under the command of the Interior Ministry, while others are controlled by the Popular Mobilization Forces, which technically report to the joint operations command.  Some of the Popular Mobilization Forces have close links to Iran and are among the 30 armed groups that are now being integrated into the security structure. But a few heavily armed groups close to Iran have remained outside that integration process.  Complicating the security landscape further, there are two or three armed extremist groups that oppose the government, as the protesters do. But these groups seem bent on disrupting the peaceful protests with armed attacks.  Their presence makes it possible for rogue elements within the various government security forces to operate with impunity and blame extremist groups for their activities.  President Salih said the shooting of the protesters was “a criminal, armed attack carried out by criminal and outlaw gangs.” He admonished the security forces, saying their responsibility was not only to protect “the peaceful demonstrators and public and private property” but also to “chase the outlaw criminals and arrest them and bring them to the judiciary for punishment.”  The protesters were shot near the Sinak Bridge, which spans the Tigris River — one of three bridges that have been taken over by protesters. In addition to the deaths, about 100 people were wounded in the shootings.  The assault started in a six-story parking garage that overlooks the bridge and the Tigris River. The garage is one of two buildings that have become protester strongholds.  “What happened was that at 8 p.m. yesterday, we were surprised when we heard a fight happen on the fourth floor and then suddenly there was shooting,” said Murtada Saad, 18, a tuk tuk driver who works around the bridge and had driven his three-wheeled vehicle into the building.  Soon after, there was shooting outside, as well as in a nearby square which the protesters have also occupied. Witnesses described a chaotic situation in which they said some gunmen appeared to be wearing the military uniforms of government forces. Some were wearing uniforms of the Popular Mobilization Forces and some were in civilian clothes.  The protesters called on the Iraqi military to intervene. But some soldiers were attacked when they arrived, adding to the confusion and forcing them to retreat.  Witnesses said at least some of the attackers, maybe all of them, sped away in white pickup trucks. Video footage showed at least seven vehicles. The sound of continuous shooting can be heard in the video as the trucks leave.  Over the past several weeks, followers of Mr. al-Sadr have occupied the parking garage near the Sinak Bridge. Mr. Saad, the tuk tuk driver, said Saturday that a couple of days ago, some people had come to the building saying they were from the south of Iraq and had set up tents on the fourth floor.  “None of our guys searched the two tents because, unfortunately, some of our guys take bribes and anyone can bring anything into the building,” he said. “So they brought weapons into the building.”  Mr. Saad continued: “In the beginning, we were attacked from inside the building by the infiltrators, and then we were surprised by heavy shooting and many vehicles. There was a literal massacre.” The Popular Mobilization Commission told its followers to obey the directives of the Iraqi defense forces and to stay away from the centers of protest.   Mr. al-Sadr told his followers on Twitter to go home for now or to stay in the heavily populated protest squares.  Some of the protesters who had manned the Sinak Bridge were there on Saturday to mourn their lost friends.  Karar Jabar, 25, said he had gotten to know Mustafa Kamal, 21, over the last month of protest. They visited each other — at their posts on different bridges.  “We were surprised by the heavy fire around 8 last night. I tried to speak to them, but they were completely evil killers,” Mr. Jabar said.  “My friend Mustafa, whom I came to see here at Sinak, got killed by sniper fire,” he said as he bent to light votive candles he had placed on the concrete around the dried blood where his friend had fallen. “They treated us brutally as if we are their enemies.”']",It remained unclear who killed a dozen protesters and bombed the home of the antigovernment cleric Moktada al-Sadr.
France’s Weekend of Discontent: Yellow Vest and Pension Protesters Gather,2019-12-07,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — One protest movement started a year ago in France and drew hundreds of thousands at its peak to roundabouts across the country in angry “Yellow Vest” demonstrations against planned increases in gas taxes.  Another — a nationwide strike expressing fury over President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul the pension system — began this past week. On Saturday, it continued to paralyze parts of the country. Even as the strength of the long-running Yellow Vest protests has dissipated over the year, the movement’s simmering anger at the president has run smack dab this weekend into the latest turmoil over his pension plans. Both events have harnessed broader discontent with the policies of Mr. Macron, who is viewed both by both Yellow Vests and labor activists as arrogant and disconnected from their daily struggles. At their most violent, the Yellow Vest protests saw people break shop windows, the police fire tear gas and rubber bullets and Mr. Macron consider a state of emergency. More Yellow Vest rallies were expected in Paris and other cities on Saturday, and so were traditional union demonstrations against unemployment. But the size and impact of both are uncertain. And though neither is directly tied to the pension demonstrations, both could get a boost from the latest social unrest.  On Saturday, about a thousand Yellow Vest protesters marched from the Economy Ministry to southern Paris. The demonstration was mostly calm, despite brief scuffles with the police, who fired tear gas. A separate union protest gathered in the Montparnasse neighborhood, while labor activists also demonstrated in cities like Marseille and Caen. There is little sign of any coordination among any of those causes: The Yellow Vests — named for the fluorescent emergency gear that all French drivers must have in their vehicles — are largely leaderless and the union rallies are held annually on the first Saturday of December.  But the pension fight has given new energy to both movements, and some Yellow Vests took part in this past week’s labor marches, a stark contrast to last year, when they rejected unions as inefficient and archaic. And the government was gearing up for more protests in the coming week. Labor unions have called for huge street demonstrations on Tuesday, the day before Prime Minister Édouard Philippe is expected to unveil fresh details of the pension plans.  Mr. Macron has promised to standardize 42 public and private pension schemes into one state-managed, point-based plan. But for many protesters, nothing less than the future of their vaunted social safety net is at stake. Many fear losing money and having to work longer before retiring. The protests have already unleashed days of public transportation chaos that halted trains and led to canceled flights. On Saturday, the impact of the continuing strike was limited, since weekday workers did not have to commute. But train traffic was still heavily disrupted across France, and some businesses have started expressing worries that the strike could affect Christmas shopping. “This new movement and the risk of continuing strikes are a further hard blow for shopkeepers who were already seriously affected by one year of the Yellow Vest movement,” said Yohann Petiot, the head of the Alliance du Commerce trade group, in a statement.  Only one in six scheduled high-speed trains was running, and in Paris, nine out of 16 metro lines remained shut down. Unrelated protests by truck drivers over fuel tax hikes worsened the disruptions, as trucks were used to block highways and tollbooths, slowing traffic to a crawl in places like Normandy and the Toulouse region.  France’s national railway company, S.N.C.F., warned residents of Paris and its suburbs that crowds at some regional express stations on Monday could be “dangerous” because there were expected to be five times fewer commuter trains.  “S.N.C.F. is asking those who can to cancel their trips,” the company said on Twitter.  Labor unions, expecting a protracted struggle against the government, have activated strike funds to mitigate the loss of income for striking workers. Some supporters of the protesters have also started fund-raising campaigns.  One was even started on Twitch, the video game streaming platform, where a collective of streamers and artists have vowed to keep broadcasting games, artwork and political discussions as long as the strike continued.  The stream  has raised more than 33,000 euros, nearly $36,500, so far.  “It is not always possible to take to the streets or to go on strike,” the collective said on the website for the project. It added that it was important to “invent new spaces for mobilization and other ways of accompanying the movement.” (The French government has had similar ideas.)  Mr. Philippe lamented in a televised address on Friday the spread of “fake news” about the pension overhaul. He specifically blamed a number of “simulators” that some unions have put online to show people how they would be affected by the changes, under which workers would accumulate points over the course of their careers and cash them in when they retire. Noting that the details of the plan had yet to be unveiled, he said that such simulators “correspond to nothing.”  But the lack of clarity from the government has left many people in France fearful that their pensions will be diminished.  Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, said on Saturday that the “real problem” for French workers was that they retired “too late” and “too poor.” “We have three days left to put the maximum amount of pressure so that it gives up on the idea of a point-based retirement system,” Mr. Mélenchon, speaking to reporters in Marseille, said of the government.']",Few trains were running and most Paris metro lines were closed in the face of a strike and the long-running protests.
Call It a Crime of Pasta,2019-12-07,By Jason Horowitz,"['BARI DISPATCH The famous pasta-making women of Bari, Italy, are worried that a crackdown on contraband orecchiette pasta could threaten their way of life. By Jason Horowitz BARI, Italy — The grandmothers set up shop early. Out of ground-floor kitchens that opened directly onto the street, they came out singing old songs, sweeping the stone floor and scattering their homemade orecchiette, the city’s renowned ear-shaped pasta, on the mesh screens of wooden trays. As the pasta dried in the sun along with the sweatpants, T-shirts and bath towels draped from the balconies above, Nunzia Caputo, 61, sat making more with her mother. A local man popped by to buy a kilo, which Ms. Caputo weighed out on an old-fashioned scale. “Here it’s always fresh,” she said, in a kitchen cluttered with simmering pots of sauce, sacks of semola flour and a muted television. “If nobody buys them, we eat all of them. And this happens,” she said, pointing at her belly. The scene — the grannies, the handmade pasta, the curved stone street — evoked the southern Italy of popular imagination.  The orecchiette makers of via dell’Arco Basso in the southern coastal town of Bari have drawn cruise ship tourists, and contributed to Lonely Planet naming Bari one of Europe’s top 10 destinations.  They also inspired Dolce & Gabbana to film a cosmetics ad (“Pasta, Amore e Emotioneyes”) in which Sylvester Stallone’s adult daughters strut down the street in black negligees, dance with the grandmas and sift orecchiette through their fingers. But local officials suspect that the pasta street, in the historical part of town known as Old Bari, is the scene of a crime that has prompted the orecchiette crackdown scare of 2019. According to the mayor’s office, in mid-October police inspectors busted a local restaurant for serving untraceable orecchiette, a violation of Italian and European Union regulations that require food in restaurants to be clearly sourced. The police fined the restaurateur and forced him to trash three kilos of pasta, or about seven pounds.  The November news reports  (“Strong hand against the handmade orecchiette in Old Bari” wrote La Repubblica) immediately worried the sharp-elbowed women of Bari, who are permitted to sell small plastic baggies of pasta for personal use, but who are not licensed to deliver large, unlabeled shipments to restaurants.  The women don’t earn much to begin with, and fear having to wear hairnets, issue receipts and pay taxes. People here are asking if the Italian zeal for regulations, however often ignored, will end up overpowering the local pride in a custom that has brought Bari — where many families have their go-to pasta lady — tourists and much-needed good press.  The mayor, Antonio Decaro, has promised to work something out. In the meantime, he has apparently advised the grannies to lay low. “Our first citizen told us not to say a word about this,” Ms. Caputo said, referring to Mr. Decaro. “No information. That it’s bad for us.”  Another nonna, an 82-year-old who spent a recent morning singing old songs (“This love had me in chains”) and would only be identified as Vittoria, said, “Here everyone is scared that the financial police is going to crack down on us.”  As the grandmother threatened a reporter for asking too many questions, the neighbor across the street blasted AC/DC’s rock anthem “Thunderstruck,” which he called “self-defense” against her constant singing and sharp tongue. “She’s nice if you are passing by for two minutes,” the neighbor said, but added that she was hard to live across from.  [Read: Departing: Two Shopkeepers, Their Cat and Part of Paris’s Soul.] On the opposite end of the street, Angela Lastella, 64, stood surrounded by clear plastic bags of orecchiette, taralli crackers and sun-dried tomatoes. She shooed away a carb-hungry pigeon and cooed at local nursery school children on a field trip to the street, but clammed up on the topic of orecchiette trafficking.  Asked about a possible proposal for the women to join together to more legally sell their goods, she shouted with exasperation, “Who’s going to make a cooperative?” Until 20 years ago, Old Bari was known as “Mugging-town,” a forbidden zone run by criminal clans. Theft has a long tradition here. In 1087, Barese sailors looking for a pilgrimage attraction stole from present-day Turkey the bones of St. Nicholas, the model for Santa Claus and now one of Bari’s patron saints. (And the patron saint of, among other things, thieves.) The relics are still in Bari’s San Nicola basilica. More recently, Vito Leccese, the mayor’s chief of staff, said his boss received a police bodyguard after taking on criminally linked street-food vendors and upset some traditionalists for prohibiting locals from selling raw mussels rinsed in seaport water. Before pasta, he said, many of the city’s older women sold contraband cigarettes from Montenegro. “We are trying to help them,” he said, adding that the administration was looking into the possibility of making the area a free-trade zone and that there was nothing wrong with them selling a couple of kilos to the occasional orecchiette user off the books. “It doesn’t hurt anyone,” he said. The law did not seem of primary concern to many around town. At l’Osteria delle Travi, waiters brought out heaping plates of orecchiette, which Nicola Fiore, a manager, said was not sourced to the women of l’Arco Basso, but to “another lady,” across town. Many locals argued that the regulations represented the real threat. “These women work 10, 15 hours a day, seven days a week to support their unemployed husbands and sons,” said Francesco Amoruso, 76, whose mother, one of the street’s venerable pasta makers, died last year at age 99. “And this is who they come down hard on?” Michele Fanelli, an advocate for local traditions who also offers classes in orecchiette making, has stepped forward to defend the women, arguing that they are last vestiges of a disappearing Bari. “Globalization is threatening the traditions,” he warned before walking into Ms. Caputo’s kitchen. He talked orecchiette and globalization with Ms. Caputo and her mother, Franca Fiore, 88. Ms. Fiore, when asked about the inspections, shrugged: “They’re right. Taxes and things like that. It’s all off the books.”  As the women pounded, sliced and nimbly molded the dough, Ms. Fiore said her own mother taught her how to make the pasta as a little girl to feed her father and seven brothers. Ms. Caputo said her mother’s mother had also “obligated” her to make orecchiette starting at age 6. (Ms. Lastella, the pasta-maker from down the street, had earlier said it was a prerequisite for marriage.) They meant this in a good way.  “We have to transmit these values to the next generation,” Ms. Caputo said. “Everything now is based on technology, all the kids with their technology.” “Globalization,” Mr. Fanelli concurred. “They should help us pass this tradition down, not exterminate it,” Ms. Caputo continued. “You should teach it at school. You have kids now who can speak two or three languages but can’t do this. If you give them a little ball of dough, their eyes light up.” “The Gospel according to Nunzia,” her son, Rino Caputo, 43, said dismissively as he walked by to stir a pot of peas. In the evening, as the women brought their trays of pasta into kitchens adorned with St. Nicholas shrines, Diego De Meo, 44, the owner of the restaurant Moderat, across from City Hall, waited for the evening rush.  He said he didn’t know which restaurant was caught serving contraband orecchiette but talked about how those little irregular, handmade pasta ears had “a little magic in them.” He suggested that trying to regulate Bari was like trying to straighten the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  “Sometimes the irregular is what makes things beautiful,” Mr. De Meo said. Pressed further for a hint on the identity of the offending restaurant, he paused awkwardly. “It was me,” he blurted out, adding that he alerted other restaurants, many of which he said bought orecchiette from the women. “Look, it’s correct, it’s the law,” he acknowledged, referring to the fine. But while his business was unaffected, he felt bad for the women of Bari who he said “are perplexed.” The pasta sting left him bewildered too.  As the cops rifled through his orecchiette stash and inquired about his dealer, he recalled looking at them with astonishment and asking, “Aren’t you guys from Bari?”']",
Zelensky’s Opponents Fear He Is Ready to Capitulate to Russia,2019-12-05,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['KYIV, Ukraine — Washington may be obsessed with the impeachment inquiry over President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, but it was far from the minds of a few thousand protesters who gathered on a recent frosty night in Kyiv to vent their anger at their own country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, over his peace overtures to Russia. If he struggled to resist demands by Mr. Trump for investigations affecting next year’s United States elections, some protesters said, imagine what will happen when he meets President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday for talks on ending the war in eastern Ukraine. As speakers derided Mr. Zelensky as soft on Russia, the crowd answered with cries of “No to capitulation!” and “Treason!” Mr. Zelensky campaigned for the presidency on a two-plank platform of fighting corruption and ending a grinding war with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 13,000 people.  While the peace effort has received less notice, it is undoubtedly the more politically treacherous of the two undertakings. Everyone is against corruption, in theory at least, but there are sharp divides over how to deal with Russia, which is widely despised by Ukrainians outside the breakaway eastern territories. Domestic political opponents are concerned that Mr. Zelensky, having no clear American diplomatic backing, may be too willing to make concessions to Moscow in the talks. Any widespread perception that he has done so could weaken him politically, hampering his ability to follow through with his anticorruption efforts. “If the president signs anything granting Russian influence in Ukraine, it would cause riots,” said Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament in the party of former President Petro O. Poroshenko, which is in opposition to Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Ariev said that the talks with the Trump administration over opening investigations related to the family of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “were unprofessional, and that is why we are concerned about what will come” in talks with Russia. Already, the critics say, Mr. Zelensky has made unilateral concessions intended to pave the way for the peace talks. And they are alarmed at comments by Ihor Kolomoisky, a businessman with ties to Mr. Zelensky, suggesting that Ukraine should swivel toward Russia amid the chaos in Ukraine policy in the United States. In the worst-case scenario, they say, Mr. Zelensky would give amnesty to rebel leaders and grant sweeping autonomy to the breakaway regions, while allowing Russian forces to linger in or just outside Ukraine even after any political settlement. In the peace talks, scheduled for Monday in Paris, most analysts see Russia seeking at a minimum to trade de facto control over the two separatists zones in eastern Ukraine for influence in domestic Ukrainian politics, including a veto on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In its post-independence history, Ukraine has twice tilted from pro-Western to pro-Russian governments, in 1994 and 2010. It’s a back-and-forth common to many former Soviet states as they have tried to play the powerful east-west geopolitical forces off against each other for advantage at home. In Ukraine’s case, on both occasions the country lurched back into the Western orbit, most recently in the Maidan revolution of 2014. In recent years, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova have all at some point pivoted to closer ties with Russia — and then back, in some cases. In an interview, Mr. Kolomoisky said that Ukraine should do just that if America tries to pressure Kyiv again.  Analysts saw the comments as self-serving, in that Mr. Kolomoisky stands to lose billions of dollars under a banking sector overhaul backed by Western governments. Mr. Zelensky issued a statement distancing himself from the comment. Working as an actor in Moscow in 2014 as Russian troops invaded his country, Mr. Zelensky joked that Russian soldiers were not moving inside Ukraine, but were “just standing on the border, and the Ukrainian border is just slightly pushed forward.” But through the summer, Mr. Zelensky sought a White House visit to urge Mr. Trump to press Russia and side with Ukraine in the negotiations. It never materialized.  To the contrary, at a news conference in New York in September, Mr. Trump backed away from Mr. Zelensky and his troubles in the war, telling the Ukrainian leader, “I really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.” By distancing himself from Mr. Zelensky in the negotiations, as stressed by many of the security professionals who testified in the recent impeachment hearings, Mr. Trump has raised doubts about how far he will go to support Ukraine and made it harder for the Ukrainian government to defend the concessions it is making to end the war.  Some analysts say that despite Mr. Zelensky’s weak hand going into the talks, worries of a pivot to Russia are overblown and mostly whipped up by domestic political opponents. “Accommodation with Russia would be a very hard sell inside Ukraine,” Steven Pifer, a former United States ambassador to Ukraine, said in a telephone interview. Ivan Yakovina, a foreign policy columnist with Novoye Vremya magazine, concurred, saying that allies of Mr. Poroshenko, the former president, were fanning fears of a geopolitical pivot to undermine Mr. Zelensky. “They don’t think he is worthy of being president,” Mr. Yakovina said of Mr. Zelensky, who before his election as Ukraine’s leader played a president in a television series. They see him “as a clown from a television show. They are doing everything so he fails.”  To pave the way for talks, Mr. Zelensky rebuilt a bridge across the de facto border with the breakaway republics, pulled troops back from the front line in three locations, negotiated a prisoner exchange and agreed to the outlines of a political formula for an eventual settlement. Mr. Zelensky has said that each step was worthwhile in its own right. He secured the return of Ukrainian captives, eased hardship for people living in separatist areas and ended some of the senseless skirmishing along the front.  In the settlement road map signed in early October, Mr. Zelensky agreed to a timeline for local elections and to other political steps needed to reintegrate the breakaway regions with Ukraine without any corresponding timeline for Russia to withdraw its troops. Mr. Zelensky says the Russian troop withdrawal is implied. Three protests ensued on Independence Square — the largest of which drew about 20,000 people, far fewer than the gigantic crowds that gathered on the square in the 2014 revolution and drove the pro-Russian leader Viktor F. Yanukovych into exile in Moscow. “There are clear red lines that Ukrainian society, and especially the active part of Ukrainian society, is not willing to cross and not willing to let anybody cross, including the leaders of the country and the president,” said Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, the leader of the opposition Holos political party. Mr. Vakarchuk pointed to polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians oppose a settlement on terms of the so-called Minsk agreements, the framework deal under which Mr. Zelensky will negotiate in Paris.  Under 20 percent of Ukrainians support the political framework that Mr. Zelensky is pursuing, about 25 percent want to continue fighting to free the separatists territory, and about 35 percent want to declare the regions as occupied by Russia but not pursue military efforts to recover them for now, according to a poll by Rating Group, which conducts social surveys.  Mr. Vakarchuk says he is consulting with Mr. Zelensky’s party in Parliament and would support any agreement that emerges from the Paris talks if it defends Ukrainian interests.  That will be harder to pull off with America distracted, though. “For a long time, the United States was considered the leader of the free world, and I think that was fair enough,” Mr. Vakarchuk said. “But remember the Bob Dylan song — ‘The Times They Are a-Changin’.’” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting. ']",The Ukrainian president’s political opponents worry that the Trump impeachment inquiry may have weakened Ukraine’s position before peace talks in Paris next week. 
"Portrait of London Bridge Killer, in His Own Words",2019-12-05,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON —\xa0“I have learnt that many of my past beliefs came from my misinterpretations of Islam,” the young man wrote to his probation officers. “There were many gaps in my knowledge but now I am on new path and am learning to become a good Muslim. I would like a chance to prove to you that I will not cause harm to nobody in our society.” Last Friday, the man who wrote those words, 28-year-old Usman Khan, traveled unsupervised from his probation hostel in England’s West Midlands to London, where he carried out a deadly terrorist attack after having participated in a conference on prison rehabilitation. A week after the attack, questions remain about why he was allowed to travel by himself to the conference and, more broadly, about Britain’s rehabilitation system and the process of releasing convicted terrorists back into society. On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that 74 people who had been jailed for terrorism offenses and released early would have their license conditions reviewed, and he vowed that serious offenders would no longer obtain early release.  But interviews with people familiar with Mr. Khan’s history — and copies of letters and reports on his progress written by Mr. Khan and obtained from officials with the government’s counterterrorism Prevent Program and the probation service — show that the problems of rehabilitating radical jihadis are complex, and do not always lend themselves to simple solutions like longer prison terms. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, because investigations into the attack are underway. Mr. Khan clearly engaged in a long-term effort to con the British authorities. Before being released from jail last December, halfway through a 16-year sentence for his involvement in a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange, he took every opportunity to convince his parole officer and the Home Office that he was a changed man. For years, he wrote letters from jail assuring officials that he no longer embraced radical Islamic ideology and felt deep remorse about his membership in a Qaeda-inspired cell that had planned to carry out attacks in Britain. In one letter to the Home Office, dated Oct. 15, 2012, soon after his incarceration, he requested placement in a deradicalization course.  “I would like to prove to the authorities, my family and society in general that I don’t carry the views I had before my arrest,” he wrote, “and also I can prove that at the time I was immature and now I am much more mature and want to live my life as a good Muslim and also a good citizen of Britain.”  Later that year, he was enrolled in the Healthy Identity Intervention Program, the government’s main vehicle for dealing with people convicted of offenses linked to terrorism. While enrolled in that course, he wrote long reports about his putative progress and repeatedly asked for a chance to prove that he was no longer a threat. A probation service official familiar with Mr. Khan’s case said that he carried out an elaborate deception of all the agencies that had been monitoring him. The official insisted that nothing in his behavior suggested he would do anything improper, let alone the terrible attack he pulled off. Before the attack, Mr. Khan was under active surveillance by the MI5 domestic intelligence agency, which had set his level of threat to the public as “low to medium.” He had the highest level of security measures applied to his parole, according to an internal probation report. The probation official said that Mr. Khan would have to have shown significant progress to be allowed to attend the conference.  He displayed those feigned signs of progress on the morning of the conference, when he spoke about his rehabilitation efforts — a “compelling success story,” as one conference participant described it. But during a break in the conference program, the BBC reported, Mr. Khan disappeared into a bathroom and re-emerged wearing a fake suicide vest with two large knives taped to his hands — it is unclear how he got the weapons into the building.  He then set off on a rampage across the grand Fishmongers’ Hall venue, where he killed two recent Cambridge University graduates who were attending the conference and injured three other people before being tackled down by members of the public, including other rehabilitated offenders attending the conference, and shot dead by the police. Mr. Khan’s case demonstrates the difficult challenge of distinguishing impostors from those who have truly had a change of heart and mind. The Prevent official, a former extremist himself, was shocked to learn that Mr. Khan had been allowed to travel to London alone. He said the extremists who plan the attacks are master manipulators who learn the tricks of the game in prison. They have to be watched constantly, he said, until you have absolute proof that they have changed.  Mr. Khan’s path to radicalization started at the age of 14, when he became active in Britain’s homegrown extremist network, Al Muhajiroun, regularly participating in their provocative public preaching events and demonstrations.  At 16, he became a student of Anjem Choudary, a radical Muslim preacher who this year was released from a probation hostel to home arrest after serving time in prison for inciting support fort the Islamic State. While most Al Muhajiroun members abide by a “covenant of security” that forbids attacks on non-Muslims in members’ country of residence, some senior activists maintain that individuals have a choice whether to accept it. Mr. Khan clearly did not.  In 2010, at 19, Mr. Khan came to the attention of the security services after joining a group of eight extremists inspired by Al Qaeda and started discussing plans to carry out bomb attacks across British cities and build training facilities for militants. He was convicted of terrorism offenses in 2012 and served eight years in prison. Since his release, Mr. Khan had been living in a probation hostel in Staffordshire, a county known for its quaint villages and historic market towns.  He was required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet that allowed the police to track his movements, the probation service official said. Restrictions were applied to his phone and internet usage, he was barred from meeting associates and was required to meet with a probation officer at least twice a week. The probation official declined to comment on the assessment that allowed Mr. Khan to travel unaccompanied to London last Friday, saying that it was under investigation. But he reiterated that Mr. Khan had shown no signs that aroused suspicion or concern. Mr. Khan was also placed in the government’s secretive Desistance and Disengagement Program, which was introduced in 2016 as a more holistic approach to rehabilitation, with support that includes mentoring, psychological counseling, and theological and ideological advice. That approach has been applied to British jihadi fighters returning from Syria and Iraq. Experts say it is too soon to say whether its methods have been effective, though Mr. Khan hardly provides a basis for optimism.  The Prevent official said that deradicalization required time, patience and expert counseling to understand the extremists’ narrative, background and state of mind, and then to convince them of the flaws in their thinking. “It is much easier to deceive people when you do not fear death,” the official said. “I’m sure Usman was genuinely in good spirits when he left the hostel and traveled to London, because in his world he was about to be set free as a martyr.”']","The extremist behind last week’s London Bridge attack wrote letters to the authorities from jail, claiming that he was on a “new path” and was “learning to become a good Muslim.”"
Claims of China’s Meddling Roil Taiwan Ahead of Elections,2019-12-06,By Steven Lee Myers and Chris Horton,"['TAIPEI, Taiwan — In December 2016, Xiang Xin, a businessman based in Hong Kong, and his wife asked the government in Taiwan for permission to invest in real estate, as foreigners must do. After a four-month investigation, officials rejected their application. “Their relationship with China’s People’s Liberation Army was extraordinarily close,” Chang Ming-pin, executive secretary of the commission at Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs that reviews foreign investments, said in an interview. “That complicated things.” Now Mr. Xiang’s name has surfaced again in a possibly related intrigue. Last month, he was identified at the center of an extraordinary — if still largely unverified — tale of covert operations by China’s military intelligence agencies to undermine democracy in Taiwan.  A man claiming to work for a company owned by Mr. Xiang, Wang Liqiang, told the authorities in Australia in a 17-page appeal for political asylum that the couple served as a front for China’s covert efforts to manipulate the outcome of elections in Taiwan. He detailed a multipronged effort to finance pro-Beijing candidates, buy off voters and sow disinformation on television channels and on the internet.  The effort, Mr. Wang said, has intensified ahead of a presidential vote, scheduled for Jan. 11, that has taken shape as a stark choice between a closer relationship with China or a more forceful assertion of the island’s status as a self-governed democracy.  The allegations have punctuated longstanding fears of Chinese interference in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as an inviolable part of a greater China. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has made no secret of the country’s ambitions to absorb Taiwan, warning this year that he would use force, if necessary, to prevent any move to formal independence.  Intelligence officials in Australia and the United States are now reviewing Mr. Wang’s claims, which have set off a new criminal inquiry in Taiwan into the couple’s activities.  Wang Ting-yu, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee of Taiwan’s legislature, said in an interview that the couple’s investment application in 2016 had raised a red flag for investigators, who began looking into their links to the Chinese military and defense companies. Since then, counterintelligence officials have tracked the couple’s visits to the island. They came as often as once a month, he said. “We know their background, and they’re on a list,” he said. “Watching people like this developing their network is a traditional method for investigating this kind of case.” Since the would-be defector Wang Liqiang’s claims surfaced in Australia, which is having its own debate about the extent of Chinese influence there, some analysts have raised doubts about the scope or significance of his possible role as an intelligence operative, citing his age and his background as a painter. China has said he is a convicted fraud. But some of the allegations he detailed are at least plausible, according to officials and lawmakers in Taiwan, especially given China’s long history of trying to win hearts and minds on the island through investments and cultural exchanges, as well as through coercive and covert means. They include what appeared to be efforts by Mr. Xiang and his wife to invest in businesses in Taiwan despite their investment application being rejected in 2017. The most fiercely disputed of Mr. Wang’s claims was that Mr. Xiang’s company helped funnel political donations to Han Kuo-yu, a populist who was unexpectedly elected mayor of a southern port city, Kaohsiung, in an election last year. A maverick within the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, Mr. Han is now challenging Taiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen. Mr. Han has promised to improve relations with China, which is Taiwan’s biggest trading partner, and as mayor has traveled to Shenzhen, the southern Chinese technology hub, to drum up business and meet Beijing’s official in charge of Taiwan affairs. Mr. Han and his campaign aides have denied receiving any donations from China. To critics, the allegations of China’s interference on Mr. Han’s behalf underline his coziness with the Communist Party in Beijing, which routinely denounces Ms. Tsai and her party, the Democratic Progressive Party.  On the campaign trail, Ms. Tsai and other party candidates have denounced China’s interference and warned that under China’s terms for unification, Taiwan could end up like Hong Kong. There, protesters have for months been pushing back against Beijing’s efforts to chip away at the semiautonomous Chinese territory’s unique social and political freedoms. “With Taiwan’s ballots we want to tell the world that we don’t want to be like Hong Kong,” Taiwan’s premier under Ms. Tsai, Su Tseng-chang, said at a campaign rally in New Taipei City this week. He warned that China’s terms for unification would mean surrendering Taiwan’s sovereignty. “We want to be the masters of our own country,” he thundered, drawing rousing cheers from a crowd of several thousand Tsai supporters. Mr. Xiang and his wife, who were in Taiwan when the appeal leaked, were detained by the authorities at the main international airport on Nov. 24 and ordered not to leave the island. It is not clear if they are cooperating with investigators. They could not be reached for comment. Mr. Xiang, 54, is the owner or top director at more than a dozen different companies in Hong Kong. One of them cited in the would-be defector’s appeal, China Innovation Investment Limited, focuses on both private and public investments in military related to the “integration of military and civil sectors” including military joint ventures, according to company documents.  The company issued a statement denying the accusations raised in the asylum appeal. Mr. Xiang, in an email, claimed he did not know the would-be defector. But Wang Ting-yu, the lawmaker in Taiwan, said that investigators in fact had a photograph of the couple with their employee, Wang Liqiang, undercutting that denial. Taiwan’s investigative bureau declined to comment on the case.  Since the accusations emerged, the company, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange but incorporated in the Cayman Islands, stopped responding to requests for comment as new details emerged. The company’s two independent directors resigned, according to a shareholder notice issued on Nov. 27.  Another company cited in the allegations is China Trends Holdings, which in 2010 signed a memorandum of understanding with a major Chinese defense manufacturer, China North Industries Group Corporation, or Norinco, Reuters reported last month.  The biography of Mr. Xiang’s wife, Gong Qing, includes positions at two institutions linked to the Communist government, including the National Scientific and Technology Information Center, a military intelligence organization that is part of the People’s Liberation Army. Mr. Xiang and Ms. Gong, whose surname is also rendered as Kung, appear to have invested in real estate as well, despite having been denied approval for an investment in business. They might have done so using other names or proxies, according to officials and news reports. Business Today, a Taiwanese publication, reported last week that Ms. Gong bought three luxury apartments in Taipei’s Xinyi District, one for $2.6 million in February 2017 and two neighboring apartments for $6.6 million in July that same year.  Taiwan’s investigators are also examining Mr. Wang’s claims that Mr. Xiang’s investment companies secretly funneled payments to numerous media sources, funded 20 media and internet marketing companies and created more than 200,000 false accounts on social media. He cited, among others, CTV and CTi TV, the main television channels owned by Want Want Holdings Group, a snack food company that has extensive sales in China.  A spokesman for one of the channels, CTi, said the accusations that the company received payments from China were absurd.  In his account, Mr. Wang said he had been assigned by Mr. Xiang and his wife to travel to Taiwan with a false passport to help “to manage the information on media and internet in Taiwan that are under their control.” His misgiving about the assignment, he claimed, prompted him to flee to Australia, where his wife had previously traveled with their child to study. “The purpose of such actions was to make Taiwan lose its sovereignty,” he said, adding that if China succeeded in ruling the island, “Taiwan will eternally lose democracy.”  Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

Now Drawing Viewers: The Election Interview Boris Johnson Won’t Do,2019-12-06,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson has methodically shielded himself from the scrutiny of the news media during Britain’s general election campaign, becoming the latest populist political leader who has tried to bypass journalists and take his message directly to the people. But Mr. Johnson’s refusal to submit to a TV interview with a famously forensic BBC interviewer, Andrew Neil, has blown up as an issue in the final days of his campaign, illustrating not just the similarities but also the differences between Britain and other democracies where the press is under strain. Mr. Neil reacted to the prime minister’s apparent rejection by installing an empty chair in his studio to dramatize his absence, and then lecturing Mr. Johnson about what he all but called an act of cowardice. “The prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China,” Mr. Neil said, glowering into the camera on his program Thursday evening. “So it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.” The video of Mr. Neil’s challenge quickly metastasized on social media, taking over a campaign debate that Mr. Johnson had hoped to keep rigorously focused on his promise to “Get Brexit done,” and becoming a metaphor for the antagonism between the news media and the government in Britain. Yet the episode also illustrated the peculiarly democratic nature of the relationship between British reporters and their leaders.  It is hard to imagine an American broadcaster, no matter how influential, taking the peremptory tone with Mr. Trump that Mr. Neil did with Mr. Johnson. Reporters at all levels in Britain still gleefully hurl combative questions at public officials when they have a chance. The trouble is, Mr. Johnson has kept those opportunities to a bare minimum during the campaign. He has eliminated daily encounters with reporters, and when he does meet with them, he takes a limited set of questions from preselected journalists. That is why Mr. Neil, with his no-holds-barred style, looms so large. “Neil is tough; he goes for the jugular,” said Simon Jenkins, an author and columnist who worked with Mr. Neil early in his career at The Economist. “It’s one of the relatively few times when you feel someone is getting under the skin of these people and putting them on the spot.” Mr. Neil is hardly an ordinary reporter. A bluff, burly Scotsman who once edited The Sunday Times of London, he is also chairman of the parent company of the Spectator, the weekly newsmagazine once edited by Mr. Johnson. That means he was effectively Mr. Johnson’s boss — an arrangement that is less novel than it might seem in the revolving door between British politics and journalism. At the BBC, Mr. Neil has been host of a variety of shows and is a fixture of election-night coverage. He is known for his remorseless dissection of public figures. An interrogation by him has become a rite of passage for British politicians, and Mr. Johnson is the only party leader to have ducked him during this election. Few emerge from the experience unscathed. Mr. Neil’s recent interview with the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was widely judged to have been a disaster for Mr. Corbyn after he declined four times to apologize for accusations of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in his party. Mr. Johnson has not formally ruled out an appearance on Mr. Neil’s program. He appeared on another BBC interview program, whose host is Andrew Marr, and insisted he was “perfectly happy to be interviewed by any interviewer called Andrew from the BBC.” But his staff has not agreed on a date with the BBC, and time is running out. The final TV debate between the two main party leaders on Friday failed to produce a knockout blow, with Mr. Johnson and Mr. Corbyn doggedly repeating their well-known campaign pledges and debate attack lines. Mr. Johnson used the broadcast to hammer home his promise to “get Brexit done,” while Mr. Corbyn laid stress on his determination to end austerity and redress inequality. The stalemate will probably be a bigger concern for Mr. Corbyn, who is trailing in the opinion polls and for whom the debate was an opportunity to change the dynamic of the election campaign with less than a week to go. An instant survey by YouGov, a polling firm, suggested that a small majority of viewers — 52 percent — thought Mr. Johnson had come out the victor as opposed to 48 percent for Mr. Corbyn. In the debate, Mr. Johnson doubled down on his pro-Brexit rhetoric and even seemed to defend the claim he made during the 2016 referendum on European Union membership that Britain paid the bloc £350 million pounds a week -— a statement that the country’s statistics authority later described as “a clear misuse of official statistics.” Mr. Neil, for his part, appeared to anticipate on his show that Mr. Johnson was not going to relent and agree to an interview. The theme of his questions, he said, would have been about trust, and “why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy.” “It is, of course, relevant to what he is promising us all now,” Mr. Neil said, as he hunched characteristically in his chair. Mr. Neil’s interviews are considered so potentially damaging that Labour officials have told British news outlets that Mr. Corbyn agreed to sit for him only after assurances from the BBC that Mr. Johnson would do the same. In response, Rob Burley, the BBC’s editor of live political programs, posted on Twitter that “at no stage did we tell any other party that a date for Boris Johnson was confirmed, whatever you may have read.” Mr. Neil declined to be interviewed, saying he was too busy prepping for nine hours of live election-night coverage next Thursday. “I’ve had my say, and I have nothing more to say about it,” he said. Experts on the British news media said Mr. Johnson faced a complex calculus in deciding whether to rebuff Mr. Neil. His half-hour-long program is popular among older viewers, many of whom naturally vote for the Tories. But Mr. Neil’s challenge to the prime minister was a social-media sensation with younger voters. “He may have stopped himself being humiliated with the older audience,” said Meera Selva, the director of the journalism fellowship program at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. “But online, it’s being played that he’s a coward.” Still, the standoff has also cast a harsh light on the BBC. Critics said the broadcaster should not have agreed to allow Mr. Johnson to sit down with Mr. Marr, who is viewed as a softer interviewer than Mr. Neil, unless he agreed to do both shows. There have been other complaints about its coverage. The BBC has come under criticism for using footage from 2016 of Mr. Johnson laying a wreath at a monument for the war dead rather than this year’s footage. Many observers said he looked crisper in the old footage. It also edited out footage of the audience laughing at Mr. Johnson during one of his debates. The BBC said both cases were simple editorial errors that did not reflect any attempt to show favoritism toward Mr. Johnson. Officials at the BBC have become increasingly defensive about the criticism. “In these febrile and politically polarized times, it’s hardly surprising that the BBC, which seeks to represent the nation in its entirety, is a lightning rod for political discontent,” the BBC’s director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, wrote in an op-ed published in The Guardian on Wednesday. The vitriol directed toward the BBC attests to its central role in the British media. But Mr. Johnson’s apparent decision to snub Mr. Neil — something his Conservative predecessor, Theresa May, did not do — reveals a new strain of contempt on the part of the government for the media, even Britain’s publicly-funded national broadcast service. Mr. Jenkins, who was Mr. Neil’s colleague at The Economist, said, “The idea that everyone in politics has to dance to the BBC’s tune is something people are backing away from.”']","Britain’s prime minister has yet to set a date with Andrew Neil, the BBC’s feared political interrogator. But Mr. Neil’s challenge to him is spreading widely on social media."
U.K. Halts Torture Case Against Ex-Wife of Liberia’s Charles Taylor,2019-12-07,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A British judge has dismissed torture charges against the ex-wife of a former Liberian president before her trial next month over accusations relating to the country’s civil war. Agnes Reeves Taylor, the ex-wife of former President Charles Taylor, was arrested in London in 2017 and charged with eight counts of torture and conspiracy to commit torture as part of her husband’s National Patriotic Front of Liberia, which in the 1990s participated in one of Africa’s bloodiest recent civil wars.  But a judge at the Old Bailey in London, the central criminal court for England and Wales, ruled on Friday that there was not enough evidence to prove that the group had governmental control in the areas where the atrocities were said to have taken place — a requirement for the case to be tried in Britain. The case had been viewed as an important test for those seeking to see torture in other countries punished in British courts. The country’s Supreme Court decided in a landmark ruling last month that members of nonstate groups that exercised “the functions of government” during armed conflicts could be prosecuted in Britain. More than 200,000 people died in clashes and atrocities as the National Patriotic Front of Liberia led an insurgency in the 1990s. Mr. Taylor was elected in 1997 but went into exile in 2003. At a trial in The Hague in 2012, he was sentenced to 50 years in prison after he was found guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Ms. Reeves Taylor had been accused of ordering soldiers to rape women and to beat a 13-year-old boy, among other crimes.  British court documents also said that she had ordered soldiers to tie up and torture a woman who refused to be raped by one of Mr. Taylor’s local commanders, and that she later shot and killed the woman’s two children, saying, “See, if you refuse an order, this will happen.” Ms. Reeves Taylor, 54, has denied the accusations, and said that she had never held any official position in the National Patriotic Front of Liberia. The Old Bailey judge, Mr. Justice Sweeney, said on Friday that a central question in prosecuting Ms. Reeves Taylor on torture charges was whether “at the time and location of each offense, the N.P.F.L. was exercising governmental function in the relevant area.” “In my view, the answer in each instance is clearly in the negative,” the judge said in a statement. Ms. Reeves Taylor watched the ruling by video link from a prison in Britain, according to the BBC and The Associated Press, and was set to be freed.  She claimed asylum in Britain in 2007, but her application to remain indefinitely was rejected in 2016 because of suspicions that she might have committed a crime against humanity or war crimes, according to court documents.  It was unclear whether Ms. Reeves Taylor could now stay in Britain. The decision on Friday was “heartbreaking for the victims who have waited more than 20 years for their stories to be heard by a court and for justice to be done,” said Emmanuelle Marchand, the head of legal analysis at Civitas Maxima, a group that seeks to provide legal representation for victims of international crimes.  Along with the Liberia-based Global Justice and Research Project, Civitas Maxima provided the British authorities with the initial information to conduct an investigation into Ms. Reeves Taylor. But Ms. Marchand and other representatives of rights groups said that despite the dismissal on Friday, the Supreme Court decision in November could still pave the way for further prosecutions of members of nonstate groups. “The Supreme Court has made clear that members of other armed groups that exercise sufficient control, such as ISIS and the Taliban, can be prosecuted for torture under U.K. law,” said Charlie Loudon, an international legal adviser at Redress, an anti-torture group based in Britain. A spokesman for Bark & Co, the legal firm that represents Ms. Reeves Taylor, welcomed the decision and said in a statement, “Agnes Reeves Taylor is now free to get on with her life and rejoin her loving family.” “She has been in prison since June 1, 2017, over two and a half years, for a crime she did not commit,” the statement said.

"Australia Burns Again, and Now Its Biggest City Is Choking",2019-12-06,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Flying into Sydney usually brings stunning views of rocky cliffs and crystal waters, but when Anna Funder looked out the window before landing this week, she saw only tragedy. Thick gray smoke blanketed the skyline and the coast, stretching for miles from the fire front at the southwestern edge of the city, where dried-out forests have been burning for weeks. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Ms. Funder, an award-winning Australian novelist known for stories of cruelty and resistance. “It was this huge and terrible seam of white smoke coming up from the ground beyond which the rest of the continent — where I was headed, where my home is — was invisible.  “It was as if the country were being devoured by a chemical reaction.” Sydney, nicknamed the “Emerald City” for its subtropical beauty, is struggling with a summer of choking smoke. Bush fires raging to the north, south and west since early November have pushed smoke and ash not just into neighborhoods abutting the blazes, but all the way to coastal suburbs more than 50 miles away. All of us who live here can taste the fire and feel it in our throats. Asthmatics are showing up in emergency rooms in greater numbers. Schools are canceling sports and recess. In houses built to be open to the elements, people are taping their windows shut; there have even been reports of fire alarms in office buildings set off by the smoke from miles away.  And the impact of this year’s wildfire season, which began much earlier than usual, goes beyond the physical. Rising levels of angst and anger are emerging all over Sydney, spreading like the haze. As many here see it, Australia’s conservative government, in refusing to address the threat of climate change, is favoring the country’s powerful fossil fuel industry over its largest city, as well as the rural areas where fires have already destroyed hundreds of homes.  Psychologists describe a creeping sense of impotence and dread.  “The stress based on the fact that thick smoke can accelerate pre-existing cardiovascular conditions is one thing,” said Frans Verstraten, who holds the McCaughey Chair of Psychology at the University of Sydney. “But the other kind of stress, based on the realization that there is not much we can do — helplessness; the realization that you can’t do anything about it — makes it worse.” On social media, the sharing of images of #sydneysmoke in its many shades, from orange to gray, has become a regular feature of people’s morning routines.  Others have taken to posting photos of burned leaves that show up far from the fires, or of the darkened sun, looking as toxic and red as the blazes themselves.  In diagnostic detail, they have described how it feels to deal with the extended reach of the infernos, which are large enough to be seen from space — and are even turning glaciers in New Zealand pink. State officials have warned of the dangers. The New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage said that “our network has recorded some of the highest air pollution ever seen” in the state. In November, the department recorded 15 days of poor air quality, far beyond the monthly norm.  On Monday, the levels of PM2.5, the most harmful form of pollutant, were 22 times the accepted safety level — the equivalent of smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a day. Pollution levels were expected to reach similar heights on Friday.  Even compared to the terrible fire seasons of 1994 and 2001, “this event,” state officials said, “is the longest and the most widespread in our records.” With fires also raging in the state of Queensland, that means the pressure on Australia’s government is likely to intensify.  Climate protests have become more common. At rallies, longtime activists are increasingly being joined by newcomers like Emily Xu, a 13-year-old student who skipped school to attend a protest on Nov. 29 in downtown Sydney.  She and a handful of her friends, all in school uniforms, said it was their first rally, and that they had made the trek because the fires had suddenly made climate change’s threats more real for them.  “Before I was like, ‘Oh, if we don’t have coal we won’t make any money for our economy,’” said Ms. Xu. Now, she said, fires were approaching her house and her friends’ houses, making her less worried about the economy than about survival.  Ms. Funder, the novelist, said the failure to address climate change was especially hard for her three children, who are 10, 15 and 17, to understand. “I can’t explain this to my children in a way that makes adults seem like sane, moral actors,” she said. “In this story, that’s not what we are. Although in every other way we try to look out for them and their future, in this story our failure is literally choking them, keeping them indoors at school.” In some countries, such widespread environmental effects have led to changes in policy.  Activists angry about pollution in Mexico City pushed the government to impose tougher regulations for vehicle emissions. Many academics believe China’s quick pivot to renewables in recent years was a response to air pollution and citizens’ growing concerns about its impact.  In Australia, however — where the air in Sydney was ranked among the worst in the world last month — Prime Minister Scott Morrison has resisted.  “The response has been to double down on denialism,” said David Schlosberg, director of the Sydney Environment Institute at the University of Sydney.  Instead of addressing the public’s concerns, Mr. Morrison has suggested that some forms of protest should be outlawed, while refusing to meet with retired firefighters who have warned for months that more resources are desperately needed to battle the blazes.  On Friday, Mr. Morrison merely acknowledged that the haze in Sydney “has been very distressing to people.” He recommended downloading an app that tracks the fires.  Asked about a new report questioning Australia’s stewardship of the Great Barrier Reef, which is being killed by climate change, he repeated a false assertion that Australia’s carbon emissions are declining (scientists have shown that they are still rising).  Some critics are starting to wonder how long the government’s position can last.  “I really don’t see how this governmental attack on genuine concerns, coupled with a lack of action on both emissions and adaptation policies, can stand for much longer — especially in the face of increasing disasters and emergencies,” Mr. Schlosberg said.  At the very least, the smoky conditions are forcing everyone to question their assumptions about Sydney, where fresh air and ocean breezes are treated as a daily birthright.  At the top of Sydney Tower, the city’s tallest building, Chinese tourists said they were shocked by how little they could see.  In Hyde Park, a few blocks away, Julian deCseuz, 75, sat on a bench with a mask over his face. After a few hours of use, the white cotton was already a shade of dusty brown. “Australia has always had a bush fire problem, but I’ve never seen it this bad,” he said. “I’ve been to Beijing and to Delhi, and it’s very similar conditions.” Isabella Kwai contributed reporting.']","In Sydney, fresh air and ocean breezes have long been treated as a daily birthright. Not anymore."
Strikes Against Macron’s Pension Plans Shut Down Much of France,2019-12-05,By The New York Times,"['A protest against changes to France’s pension system brought parts of the country to a grinding halt on Thursday, with nationwide strikes shutting down transportation and leaving schools and hospitals unstaffed and basic government services unmet.  Huge crowds of railway workers, teachers, students, hospital workers and other protesters peacefully marched down Paris’s wide boulevard Magenta, and amid blaring loudspeakers and occasional firecrackers, commuters struggled to find ways to get to work. Subways were largely shut, children left for school early and only about one in eight suburban trains were running in many areas, if they were running at all. Though officials and protest organizers gave conflicting figures, the demonstrations were some of the largest in recent years. The festive mood in Paris gave way to a more tense one as the day wore on, and sporadic violence broke out, especially near the Place de la République. Some violent protesters burned vehicles and threw projectiles at the police there, and officers fired tear gas and charged the group. There were also reports of isolated standoffs in other cities, including in Bordeaux, where security forces also fired tear gas. Throughout the country, workers stayed home to register opposition to the proposed changes pushed by President Emmanuel Macron. The widespread participation in the strike suggested deep social discontent, creating a new test for the government after its largely successful efforts to tamp down last year’s “Yellow Vest” protests.  “They are changing the rules mid-game, said Christine D., a 52-year-old schoolteacher who was protesting and declined to give her last name. “They don’t communicate enough with the people.” “He is completely out to lunch,” she added of Mr. Macron. One protest chant called for Mr. Macron’s early retirement later this month, when he turns 42. The government deployed thousands of additional police officers in Paris alone to prepare for potential violence. Stores and banks were boarded up, especially along the route of the main demonstration in Paris, in anticipation of action by “casseurs,” or “breakers,” who have caused havoc in previous protests. In Paris, the police announced that officers had carried out 9,350 “preventive checks” and 71 people had been arrested by 3:30 p.m. The checks were widely used by the police during the Yellow Vest rallies to keep those suspected of violent activism from reaching protest areas, a tactic that has also been criticized for infringing upon the right to demonstrate. Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the General Confederation of Labour, one of the unions opposed to the pension plans, said his group would not back down until the overhaul was scrapped, calling instead for an improvement of the current system. “Either you listen, or you continue to be stubborn the way the president has been since he was elected,” Mr. Martinez told reporters at the start of the Paris demonstration. “There is no reason to abandon a system that the whole world is envious of.” President Emmanuel Macron is “calm and determined” in the face of Thursday’s strike, though he is concerned about disruptions to daily life, a senior official at the Élysée Palace, the French presidency, told reporters at a news briefing. Mr. Macron is “watchful that public order be respected, watchful as to the difficulties for French people, and watchful also that the right to strike is respected,” said the aide, who spoke anonymously in line with French government rules. But the aide underlined the president’s determination to see his pension overhaul through.  The aide was also at pains to dismiss the idea that Mr. Macron had cut himself off from ordinary citizens over the changes. The president has yet to make a comprehensive address explaining his ideas, and his critics say he is out of touch.  The government has also been sensitive to the notion that the pension overhaul is complicated and difficult to understand. Mr. Macron wants to get rid of France’s 42 different retirement schemes and replace them with one program managed by the state. “No doubt the reform is complex,” the aide said. “But it’s a commitment he’s made.” France has one of the world’s most generous pension systems, and past efforts to change it have long proven perilous in French politics. But President Emmanuel Macron is pushing ahead, hoping to streamline a byzantine system of 42 different pension plans that collectively are headed toward a $19 billion deficit. Mr. Macron proposed merging the various plans, public and private, into one state-managed system, in which workers would accumulate points throughout their careers and then cash them in. He has promoted the idea as a fairer system, but some are concerned that they would be left with lower payouts.  One protester, Philippe Lauberthe, 47, who works at the railway company SNCF, said the proposed changes were “a race to the bottom for our pensions.” He said that a point-based system was risky for workers, since it was not clear how much points would be worth at retirement. “Finance is governing,” said Ludovic Varlet, 52, a hospital worker from Dourdan at the Paris protest. “It was the best system in the world, and they are about to destroy it.” For some, the demonstrations brought to mind protests in 1995 against attempts to overhaul pensions and other social services. Millions protested in November and December of that year, and strikes paralyzed the country for three weeks until the government backed down. But Mr. Macron’s government has tried to dispel any notion that 2019 will prove similar, noting that in 1995, the changes were not part of President Jacques Chirac’s electoral platform — unlike Mr. Macron’s — and that major unions and other groups had not been consulted. This time, the government has been discussing the project with labor unions, though the groups have expressed frustration with the lack of specifics. As often happens after major demonstrations in France, Thursday ended with a battle over attendance estimates. The Interior Ministry said on Thursday evening that more than 800,000 people had demonstrated around France, whereas the CGT, the largest labor union opposed to the pension reforms, said the figure was 1.5 million. In Paris, the police said 65,000 people had demonstrated, versus 250,000 for the CGT. After night had fallen, protesters were still filing into the Place de la Nation, the end point of the march. Either way, that makes the demonstrations some of the largest in recent years. The strikes will mostly continue on Friday and the following week, and some Yellow Vest protesters have called to demonstrate on Saturday. Most metro lines in Paris will remain closed on Friday, and 7 of 10 high-speed trains, as well as 7 of 10 express regional trains will be canceled across the country. The protests have drawn comparisons with the Yellow Vest demonstrations of 2018 that ultimately forced Mr. Macron to make concessions over fuel prices and government subsidies.  The strikes are not directly tied to last year’s protests, which channeled deeper discontent with economic inequality into a movement that brought tens of thousands into the streets. But many Yellow Vest activists have joined the new action, as have a wide spectrum of unions and political parties. Many of those marching in cities across France on Thursday wore the fluorescent vests now ubiquitous among the group. Ingrid Levavasseur, a nurse and well-known Yellow Vest activist, said she hoped the general strike would bring momentum back to the movement.  “The government is still not listening to us, but they can’t go against the people’s opinion,” Ms. Levavasseur said from her home in Louviers, in northern France. “If the government keeps ignoring our demands, this will go much further than one day of protests.” As thousands of protesters marched in eastern Paris, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe acknowledged that train traffic had been “very impacted” by the strike and that the government expected disruption again Friday. Mr. Philippe told reporters that despite scattered violent faceoffs between “breakers who had not come to protest” and that “demonstrations went fine pretty much everywhere in France.” But getting to work on Thursday morning was especially challenging for residents of Paris, where all but a few metro lines were completely shut down, and many buses remained idle in their depots. At 9 a.m. at the Trocadéro station, the metro entrance was closed. Confusion reigned as commuters checked whether the No. 9 line was up and running. (It was, but only during rush hours, and only on a limited stretch that did not include that station.) El-Kabir Abdoulhamid, 37, looked at the map on his smartphone and concluded: 25 minutes by foot. He had already taken a packed commuter train from the suburb of Evry, and his full journey would be at least 30 minutes longer than usual. “But I support their right to strike,’’ said Mr. Abdoulhamid, who works in banking. “It’ll force employers to reflect.”  Châtelet, a major metro hub and station for regional trains, was empty by late morning, and virtually all the stores inside were closed. A screen displayed all lines to the outer suburbs of Paris as being on strike, as well as most Paris metro lines. A scattering of security guards and cleaners working in the giant shopping mall Les Halles, which is connected to the station, said they had woken up earlier than usual to take trains in from the suburbs. “I can’t afford not to work,” said one cleaner who would only give his first name, Manu, as he washed the floor in front of an empty escalator. He said he was employed on minimum wage for a cleaning company subcontracted by the mall. “I know people are striking over pensions, but it makes things a lot harder.” The Gare de Lyon, a major hub in eastern Paris that has an elegant clock tower and from where trains leave for cities such as Lyon and Marseille, was nearly empty. One traveler, Alexandra, 28, who declined to give her last name, was trying not to fall asleep, bundled up in a scarf to ward off the biting cold. She said she was waiting for a train to visit family in Lyon, but it had been canceled, and she now had to wait several hours for the next one. While she felt concerned by pension changes, she said, she disagreed with the strike. “It’s inconvenient,” she said, adding that for tourists, like those on their way to see the famed festival of lights in Lyon, “It gives a bad image of France.” But when people strike in France, Alexandra said, “they don’t do it halfway.”  Along the normally bustling Rue St.-Denis in central Paris, almost every store was shuttered. At one clinic, only a handful of patients and doctors milled about. Most doctors had canceled appointments for the next two days, and the waiting room was nearly empty. Diego Piemental, 34, a manager at a nearby hair salon, gestured to his only client on Thursday afternoon. His bookings had fallen by more than half, he said. “It’s close to a holiday, when business is normally up,” he said. “And if the shops remain closed, tourists won’t come here, so that will mean even fewer clients.” With a large number of employees taking part in the protests,  the Musée d’Orsay and the Eiffel Tower were also closed. The Louvre was open, though visitors were not able to see all of the collections, and the Palace of Versailles was recommending that visitors reschedule for a later date. The Trocadéro Esplanade, which provides the best vantage point to photograph the tower, is normally packed with tourists, but on Thursday there were only a few. “You can see for yourself, it’s empty,’’ said one annoyed vendor, one of only four selling plastic replicas of the tower and other trinkets. “It’s noon — usually this place is packed with tourists,’’ said Zehar Chakri, 31, whose family owns a tourist kiosk, Souvenir de Paris, in front of the esplanade. “We haven’t sold anything today. I hope the strike doesn’t last beyond this weekend. December is usually our best month.’’ Deniz Uras, 27, a Paris-based Turkish guide, had brought two clients from Turkey to the esplanade. They had been forced to cancel plans to move on to Amsterdam. “They’re stuck, and they don’t understand why,” Mr. Uras said. “I’ve been here for 10 years, so I know striking is in the French culture.’’ Officials in tourism and in some French cities have expressed worries about the effect of the general strike. Already, officials in Lyon and Strasbourg have reported widespread cancellations by nervous tourists.

Russian Court Bans Politically Active Student From Blogging,2019-12-06,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — In a highly publicized case, a Russian court gave a political science student a three-year suspended sentence on Friday and barred him from managing websites for two years, for publishing videos in which he criticized the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. Since his arrest at the beginning of August, Yegor S. Zhukov, 21, a student at Moscow’s prestigious Higher School of Economics, has become a symbol of a wave of anti-Kremlin protests that rocked the Russian capital last summer. His videos called upon viewers to use all possible means to depose Mr. Putin, whom he called a “dictator and a tyrant.”  The prosecution highlighted the escalating effort by the Kremlin, which already exercised firm control over nearly all traditional news sources, to clamp down on independent media online. Parliament has passed a series of laws recently, in a mostly unsuccessful effort to impose government control over the internet.  Outside the court in Moscow, a crowd of about 300 people, mostly students, chanted, “We are Yegor Zhukov,” and “accountability and love,” the main slogan from his closing statement. After the verdict, Mr. Zhukov insisted that the struggle was far from over, saying that everything was now political and that Russia’s judicial system was a “repressive institution.”  “I am glad that I am free, but still what happened was absolutely unjust,” Mr. Zhukov told a crowd of supporters on the courthouse’s porch. “We should understand that everything has turned political today.” He is unlikely to spend time in prison, but the sentence means that Mr. Zhukov, who had said in court that he held ambitions of running for office, cannot take part in elections for six years. After the hearing, he said that despite the ban on managing his blog, he would find a way to remain publicly active. The result could have been much worse for Mr. Zhukov, who faced a possible sentence of to up to five years in prison. His is one of a handful of recent cases in which the government, amid an outcry over what opponents say are trumped-up charges, has backed away from harsh punishment of its critics. Protesters who have drawn less public support have received far more severe penalties than Mr. Zhukov did. Four people convicted of attacking police officers during rallies have been sentenced to prison terms as long as five years, and a demonstrator, Konstantin Kotov, was sentenced to four years for repeatedly attending unsanctioned rallies. In a separate set of verdicts, Moscow courts on Friday sentenced three other protesters. Nikita Chertsov, a technology specialist from the city of Perm, received the harshest penalty, a year in prison for pushing a police officer in the chest during a demonstration.  Many prominent public figures, as well as faculty members and students, had called for Mr. Zhukov’s release. One of Russia’s most popular rappers, Miron Fyodorov, known as Oxxxymiron, frequented court hearings and offered to pay $31,000 to bail Mr. Zhukov out. The judge rejected the offer. Speaking to reporters on Friday, the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said that Mr. Putin was aware of Mr. Zhukov’s case, but offered no details. “We aren’t turning a blind eye to something, but we don’t feel inclined to overestimate anything,” Mr. Peskov said. Mr. Zhukov was arrested shortly after the Russian authorities detained more than 1,300 people at one of the biggest unsanctioned rallies in years. The protest was set off when the electoral authorities barred several opposition candidates from running for Moscow’s City Council. Mr. Zhukov, who published a video about the protest, was initially accused of taking part in the demonstration and of directing mass riots, in a case that included other protesters. The case was later closed because of a lack of evidence that any riots had taken place. Russian investigators did not stop there, however. They accused Mr. Zhukov of inciting extremism and calling to depose the government by violent means in some of the videos he published on his YouTube channel. In September, Mr. Zhukov was released under house arrest. Russia’s financial monitoring agency included Mr. Zhukov in its list of terrorists and extremists, blocking his bank accounts. Mr. Zhukov pleaded not guilty, saying that although he considers many members of Russia’s political elite his opponents, he has never called for the use of violence. During Mr. Zhukov’s hearing, Aleksandr Korshikov, a court-appointed linguistics expert, said that in his videos, Mr. Zhukov created a negative image of the Russian government by calling it “a Kremlin scum.” The expert, an employee of Russia’s main security service, the F.S.B., also said that Mr. Zhukov had called for all forms of protests, which might include violent ones. In his court testimony, Mr. Zhukov said that on the contrary, he was calling for strictly nonviolent protests. And in a speech that has been widely shared online in Russia, he said, “I want to see these two qualities in my compatriots: accountability and love.”  “Accountability for ourselves, for those near us, for the entire country,” Mr. Zhukov said. “This desire, your honor, is another reason why I couldn’t have called for violence.”']","Yegor Zhukov, who was also given a three-year suspended sentence, has become a symbol of the anti-Kremlin protests that rocked Moscow last summer."
"Hugh, Actually: In U.K. Campaign, Voters Find an Actor at the Door",2019-12-06,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — Londoners responding to a knock on their front doors in recent days may have been surprised to see a familiar face grinning back at them: Hugh Grant, one of the country’s most recognizable actors, who made his mark as the floppy-haired, bumbling leading man in romantic comedies. But Mr. Grant, who famously played a prime minister going door to door in “Love Actually,” was not looking for a lost love this time. He was looking for votes. Celebrities have long waded into the political arena, throwing the weight of their public personas behind candidates and causes. But Mr. Grant has become one of the most vocal and active ahead of Britain’s general election on Dec. 12, pounding the pavement with candidates who differ ideologically but agree that Britain should remain in the European Union. He has campaigned with candidates for Parliament in at least four different London-area constituencies, and he has been spotted on the city’s Underground trains, headed to and from political events.  In a climate where anger and exhaustion over the still-unresolved issue of Brexit have left Britain divided like never before, the reception for Mr. Grant’s efforts has been mixed. Rather than campaigning for one particular party, he is instead calling for strategic voting to block the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Boris Johnson from winning a majority, backing the candidate in each race who he believes has the best chance to beat the Conservatives. Mr. Grant is not the first celebrity to call for an end to Mr. Johnson’s time in office, but he has been one of the most prominent — and possibly the busiest — in the weeks of canvassing before the election.  This week, he was campaigning alongside Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative lawmaker who refused to support Mr. Johnson’s Brexit plans, was expelled from the party, and is now running for his seat as an independent. In a campaign video for Mr. Grieve, Mr. Grant detailed his reasons for supporting him. ""I, for the first time in my life, am getting active politically, because I think that the country is on the edge of a true abyss,” leaving the European Union without a trade agreement, he said. He described what he said would be “the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit” under Mr. Johnson.  Speaking with voters on Monday as he canvassed with Chuka Umunna, an incumbent Liberal Democrat, he offered the same message: That the only way to avoid a disastrous withdrawal from the bloc is to edge out Conservative candidates.  “I’m wandering around London and the suburbs, banging the drum about tactical voting, because I think in the absence of complete Remain alliance, that’s our only hope as voters,” he said. Last week, Mr. Grant was canvassing with Luciana Berger, a lawmaker who was joined the Liberal Democrats this year. She resigned from the Labour Party earlier after receiving anti-Semitic abuse. This week, he was in Chingford, northeast of London, campaigning with Faiza Shaheen, a Labour candidate, at a subway station, where he handed out leaflets and spoke with voters.  While some have applauded his advocacy, others have criticized the actor for an approach that focuses only on one issue: Brexit. And some saw his decision to campaign with both Ms. Berger and Labour candidates as hypocritical, and heckled him as he canvassed with Ms. Shaheen.  He is also using his following of nearly half a million on Twitter to push for voters to lend their support to candidates calling for Britain to remain part of the European Union.  His brash approach on social media has drawn attention since August, when his expletive-laden Twitter post, bashing a controversial Brexit maneuver by Mr. Johnson, drew hundreds of thousands of reactions. But Mr. Grant has also received a fair share of online abuse as a result of his activism. In response to the backlash he has received since he began canvassing, some of which made mention of a past arrest for soliciting a prostitute, Mr. Grant made the unusual decision to post his infamous 1995 mugshot on Twitter account on Thursday night. “To my dear trolls,” he wrote. “Hope this is helpful.” But he is not alone in using his platform as an advocate for candidates. Liam Gallagher, the former Oasis frontman, told British news outlets he would be voting for the Green Party to promote climate justice. Rob Delaney, an American comedian, has been outspoken in his backing of the Labour Party and its support for the British National Health Service. In a campaign video, he detailed his experience with the health system, describing his young son’s diagnosis and eventual death from a brain tumor, and said Labour’s commitment to preserve the service was a reason to vote for the party.  The British comedian Eddie Izzard, who has long been an outspoken Labour supporter, was again out canvassing for his party’s candidates. Lily Allen, the British singer, and Stormzy, Britain’s best-known grime artist, have also voiced support for Labour. The American actor Danny DeVito urged fans to vote Labour at a film premiere this year, and made his support for the party clear while in London in 2017. While the Conservatives certainly count celebrities among their fans, they have been less visible in this campaign. The party did not reply on Friday to a request for information on celebrities campaigning alongside its candidates.  But the lack of a prominent celebrity endorsement doesn’t seem to be affecting the party’s popularity. Though recent polls have shown Labour narrowing the gap, the Conservatives have consistently held a wide lead.  ']",Celebrities have long thrown the weight of their public personas behind political candidates. But Hugh Grant has been one of the most active ahead of Britain’s general election.
Beer With Bella: Tyson Yunkaporta,2019-12-06,By Isabella Kwai,"[' You can learn a lot about someone from an interview. But can you learn more over a drink? The Australia Letter introduces a new series, “Beer with Bella,” in which one reporter in the Sydney bureau who hates beer but loves chatting (an unfortunate combination) meets interesting Australians over a drink of their choice. Sign up to get the newsletter in your inbox. ________ Tyson Yunkaporta and I did not know where to go and what to drink. For absolutely no reason, we settled on a pub with an outside courtyard in Newtown, a trendy part of Sydney. But when the author of “Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save The World” showed up in black jeans and a leather jacket he fit right in. A member of the Apalech Clan and a carver of traditional tools and weapons, Tyson has an aesthetic that is more rocker than scholar. His book, a series of yarns, or conversations, that bring the reader into Indigenous ways of perceiving the world, is thought-provoking and unconventional.  Now, he’s ready to yarn with me this afternoon. Over a beer. “I guess you could go with the Ancient Greek idea of the symposium, whether the person who is running the symposium decides how much water to put in the wine,” he said.  “Will we still be here at 11 o’clock at night? Is that what you’re saying?’ I said. An hour later, we had gone from Indigenous Australian identity to questioning Western culture and, strangely, Vikings. ________ We decided to do as in Rome and went for a local Australian pale ale called the Newtowner. ________ So I guess to start with: Why write this book? The book represents 20 years of yarns, conversations, and then two years of carving those conversations and knowledge on traditional objects. The writing part — that’s the easy part. But the knowledge is hard and takes a long time, because of the complexity. I constantly have to explain the Indigenous point of view. But what if it was the other way? What if it was turning the Indigenous point of view on the world and describing what we see? With Indigenous knowledge it’s always a dialogue. The knowledge changes depending on the relationship of the people who are sharing it. Fifty percent of what’s in the book is the reader’s knowledge because it’s what they’re bringing and what they’re thinking. There’s no quantum computer that could do the same thing that 10 people sitting around the same sandy circle drawing with sticks could do. What are the most important messages you want to send about how Indigenous thinking works in a Western world? You don’t need to learn about Indigenous knowledge to be in touch with this. You just have to remember your own. In the systems that we’re living in, there’s a very big collective memory loss. People don’t really remember who they are or what they’re supposed to be doing. A lot of people when I talk about Western this and that — people assert this idea that they don’t have a culture. No, other people have cultures. Everything outside of the West is a culture. But the West itself is neutral. People say the West isn’t a culture to you? People really assert it. It’s funny. You’re somebody who’s living in the system and you don’t have a lot of choices in that system. And we need to be looking up rather than sideways and going: Victim — victim — oppressor — evil person — hero, classifying ourselves. What do we need to be able to do to free ourselves from this? What lessons can we learn from Indigenous custodians of the land? Take Indigenous astronomy: Did you know that Aboriginal people knew that meteorites form craters before Europeans did? It’s only a few decades ago that they discovered that in modern science. But we’ve got Dreaming stories about that. People record these things and then they write it as a paper. It’s just “Wow. Aboriginal people knew about this. So Aboriginal culture is a lot smarter than we thought.” And that’s it. O.K., what are we going to do? Astrophysicists need to be sitting down with those old fellas and going into detail in those stories. Tell us the properties of that asteroid. Their knowledge is respected and even put up on a pedestal a little bit. So it’s not that — it’s this uncertainty of how to proceed. In the book’s introduction, you say you don’t want to talk too much about your own story. You have to tell your whole life story, not just yours but the traumatic story of all your recent ancestors. It’s like re-traumatizing yourself over and over and I just find it really interesting that’s the main Indigenous genre people want to see and it is just the same story over and over again. And it’s like, that’s all that people want to hear. There’s a scholar called Martin Nakata who’s said, we need to resist the self narrative. He calls it “the ubiquitous Indigenous self narrative.” It’s killing our thought. It’s killing our scholarship. I used to love it. You can wallow in that forever. I found it depressed me in the end, but it’s also easy. And everybody loves it. You’re always performing Indigeneity. I try and sabotage myself all the time in that. I’ll just destroy it. You know I’m not building a brand. I’m trying to build a collective base of knowledge and relationships and conversations that might help try to stop the world from dying in the next few decades. So what keeps you motivated? It was just the culture and curiosity and just a passion for knowledge and learning. And just relationships mostly , really strong relationships with knowledgeable people. That’s what’s motivated me up to this point. At the moment my motivation is just trying to get enough money together to be able to survive this period. Survival is an issue. I’m working on the next novel. I’m writing a Viking novel.  Are you? Tell me more. You can’t just throw that out. It’s full of black Easter eggs. I love Vikings.

Violence Drives a Swell in Mexican Migration,2019-12-07,By Kirk Semple,"['CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — A crackdown on illegal immigration has sharply curbed the number of Central Americans and others trying to enter the United States. But Mexicans, who have not been bound by some of the same restrictions, have been showing up at the border in greater numbers, in many cases fleeing the escalating violence in their country.   Thousands have been stuck for weeks here in Ciudad Juárez and other border cities, waiting for permission to cross into the United States to apply for asylum. Human rights advocates say the bottleneck violates American and international law by forcing migrants to remain in a country where they feel their lives are at risk. “We’re fearful here because you never know whether at any moment someone’s going to come and kill someone,” said Juan, 55, a farm laborer from the state of Zacatecas who fled with 10 members of his family after his son escaped a criminal group that was pressuring him to join their ranks. “Wherever we are in Mexico, the gangs can find us,” said Juan, who, like many asylum seekers interviewed for this story, asked to be identified by his first name only out of fear for his safety. The Trump administration has aggressively sought to reduce immigration — legal and illegal — by implementing more restrictive measures. Those measures include returning migrants from various countries to Mexico while their immigration cases play out in American courts, and forcing migrants to first apply for asylum in countries they traveled through on their way to the United States. The Trump administration has also pressured the Mexican government to get tougher on illegal migration, leading to the deployment of thousands of Mexican security forces to help detain undocumented migrants as they travel north. Those strategies have led to a sharp drop in the number of migrants trying to cross into the United States, officials say. But the policies have had little impact on Mexican migration because Mexicans cannot be prevented from traveling through their own country to the northern border. And Mexican asylum seekers who have entered the United States, once they apply for protection, cannot be returned home unless their petitions are denied. While the overall number of migrants arrested along the southwest border has plunged, the number of Mexicans apprehended has risen: About 17,000 Mexicans were caught crossing between ports of entry in October, a 34 percent increase since July, according to the United States Customs and Border Protection. The number of Mexicans seeking American asylum has also shot up in recent months, advocates and Mexican officials say.  As the numbers have increased, American border guards have mostly turned away the asylum seekers at the official border entrances, saying they have no capacity to receive new applicants, migrants and their advocates say.  The practice has forced thousands of Mexicans to wait along the border for a chance to make their case in the United States. Here in Ciudad Juárez, they have been sleeping under plastic tarps in squalid encampments near the three main border bridges, enduring falling temperatures and bitterly cold rains. The Mexicans have joined many thousands of asylum seekers from other countries who have also been compelled to wait in Mexico after the United States began to severely restrict the number of cases it takes in a day, a system known as “metering.”  Migrants’ advocates say the bureaucratic backup is particularly dangerous for Mexicans, who are being forced to wait in the country they are trying to flee. The Trump administration “is focused on bringing immigration basically down to nothing and in doing so they’re again destroying a system set up by Congress to protect the most vulnerable arriving at our borders,” said Shaw Drake, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union Border Rights Center in El Paso. The A.C.L.U. filed a complaint last month with the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security calling for an investigation into the metering practice, with a special focus on the policy’s impact on Mexican migrants. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has quietly launched a pilot program in El Paso designed to expedite the adjudications of Mexican migrants seeking asylum — and speed the return of rejected applicants. The initiative comes as Homeland Security officials say they have been frustrated by the recent surge of Mexican migrants crossing the border. The Department of Homeland Security did not answer questions regarding the backup of Mexican asylum seekers along the border. On a recent morning, more than 1,500 Mexican asylum seekers were waiting in Ciudad Juárez. Some had been stuck there for as long as two months. Nearly all were from the states of Michoacán, Zacatecas or Guerrero — regions where organized crime groups flourish. A chilly wind was whistling through the encampment at the foot of the Córdova-Las Américas International Bridge, where Juan, the farm laborer, had settled with his family in September. Their shelter was a tent of plastic tarps where they bathed with water stored in five-gallon paint buckets, ate food distributed by charities and slept under donated blankets. The whole family was sick with colds, he said.  “For those of us who haven’t made it across, we have to shiver for a bit,” he said. “I hope the United States government softens its heart so that more people can cross before the freeze comes.”  Juan’s son Manuel, 24, said the family had continued to receive threats from the criminal gang that kidnapped him. Manuel’s sister pulled out her phone and displayed a series of menacing messages. One read, in part: “Hand over your brother to us because we already know where you are.” “These things aren’t easy,” Juan said. Waiting lists managed by the migrants themselves and handwritten in well-worn notebooks govern the order in which families cross. On some days a few are allowed in. On others, none.  The wait in the makeshift encampments has been grueling, but many migrants say they chose it over staying in one of the city’s migrant shelters because they feared that if they were not present, they would lose their place in line and miss their opportunity to cross. “When you leave your home, you leave with energy to deal with whatever you have to, because it’s better than what you have to deal with there,” said Martín, 37, a firefighter who fled his home in the state of Michoacan with his wife and three children because of violent persecution. He declined to provide further details to protect his identity and avoid jeopardizing his case.  Officials from the state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juárez is, say they have nothing to do with the Mexican lists because they do not want to be associated with something that might be against asylum law. American officials have attributed the timing of the surge in numbers of Mexicans trying to cross the border to a change in strategy by migrant smugglers who have seen their businesses collapse as migration from Central America has diminished. “They go to Mexico and they start taking out social media ads and going to Mexican nationals and telling them, ‘If you grab a kid, that’s your passport to the United States,’” Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in October. But some two dozen migrants interviewed in the Ciudad Juárez encampments said their decision had nothing to do with a smuggler’s marketing appeal. All said they were fleeing violence.  Some said that there had been a shift in the nature of violence in their home regions. Others said that while they had suffered violent persecution for months if not years, they only just learned about asylum and their possible eligibility. “Before, if you were pursued by the criminals, you just suffered it and suffered it until they killed you,” said Jacobo, 42, an agricultural laborer who fled his home in Zacatecas with his wife and two children. “But now we know about political exile.” Still others were motivated by rumors that the American authorities were allowing more Mexicans into the United States even while they were restricting access to Central Americans and others. Regardless of the timing, advocates say, the sheer numbers — and a failure in American border policy — have generated a crisis that deserves immediate attention. “These systems for considering and processing refugee claims exist for a reason,” said Mr. Drake of the A.C.L.U. The Trump administration “is not following the process that Congress requires them to and is thereby exposing thousands of people to potential harms that they should never have been exposed to.” Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting from Washington, and Caitlin Dickerson from New York.

Splintered Isle: A Journey Through Brexit Britain,2019-12-07,By Patrick Kingsley and Laetitia Vancon,"['SHIREBROOK, England — There used to be a mine at the edge of this small town near the center of England. Now there is only a warehouse. The mine provided coal that powered the country. The warehouse stores tracksuits. The mine meant a job for life. The warehouse offers mostly temporary work for the lowest legal wage. You work here, one worker told me in the drizzly parking lot last month, and you get treated like a monkey. Shirebrook was the third stop of a 900-mile journey I made through Britain last month. I was trying to make sense of a splintered country in the run-up to the Dec. 12 general election. The outside world typically sees Britain through the affluence and cosmopolitanism of London, but other than one quick stop there, I went elsewhere, looking for people beyond the capital’s glare. Everywhere I went, it felt as if the country were coming unbound. For all sorts of reasons, all sorts of people — Leavers and Remainers; blue- and white-collar; Jews and Muslims; English, Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh — felt alienated and unmoored. At times, I was reminded that electoral politics are far removed from many people’s priorities, which range from simply making a living to fighting global warming. “There’s no Brexit on a dead planet,” said Lauren McDonald, a Glasgow student who recently quit college to mobilize against climate change. Again and again, though, people came back to the politics of nationalism, austerity and economic alienation. And in Shirebrook and beyond, the frustrations were rooted in Brexit. Since the surrounding constituency was formed in 1950, its mostly working-class residents have always elected a Labour lawmaker. Then came the 2016 Brexit referendum, in which seven in 10 local voters supported Britain’s departure from the European Union. Many are now furious that the country still hasn’t left. “Every time you turn the television on, it’s all Brexit,” said Kevin Cann, a Shirebrook resident and former miner who voted to leave. “By now it should have been done, dusted.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a pro-Brexit Conservative, hopes to turn his minority government into a majority by capitalizing on that frustration. For the first time ever, that could tip Shirebrook’s seat to the Conservatives, a party once detested in mining constituencies like this one. “Miners now are like, ‘Oh, Boris, Boris,’” said Alan Gascoyne, who once headed the mine’s union branch and now runs a former miners’ club. “Crazy,” he added. The local warehouse is at the heart of this extraordinary shift, both in Shirebrook and across post-industrial England. It was built in 2005 on the site of the town’s former coal pit. For years, the mine was the pride of Shirebrook — the reason the town was built in 1896. The work there was dangerous, but it provided secure jobs, fair salaries and pensions, as well as a sense of purpose and community. The pit was “like the mother,” Mr. Gascoyne said. “The mother sort of looked after everybody.” But the mine closed in 1993, amid a wider process of deindustrialization and privatization carried out by the same Conservative Party that Mr. Johnson now leads.  Twelve grim years later, it was physically replaced by the warehouse, but the emotional void remained. The warehouse provides more jobs than the mine did, but it is mostly low-paid work in humiliating conditions. A worker gave birth in the warehouse and left the baby in a bathroom. Others were penalized for taking short breaks to drink water. A parliamentary inquiry found that the owners, Sports Direct, treated its workers “without dignity or respect.”  Most residents refused to work in such a degrading environment, so the jobs are largely taken by people from poorer parts of the European Union. In the local consciousness, the concept of regional decline then became fused with that of European immigration, instead of neoliberal economics. “I looked at what was around me, and I looked at the dilution of wages — because Europeans are coming in,” said Franco Passarelli, the son of Italian immigrants, explaining why he voted to leave the European Union. “We’re only a small island, and if people keep coming in, basically the country is starting to implode.” In a Brexit-less world, this town might still vote en masse for Labour. The party’s manifesto promises to raise the minimum wage and scrap the kinds of employment contracts used at the warehouse. But all of this has been trumped by Brexit. Before joining the European Union, Britain was “quite a wealthy country,” said Mr. Cann, the former miner. “Why can’t we be that again?” In Shirebrook, as in much of Britain, I sensed that following through with Brexit was seen as something that could restore the social fabric. But elsewhere, it was chewing at the ties that bind. For some wealthy Londoners, who typically vote Conservative but also like Europe, Brexit has undermined their support for Mr. Johnson’s party. For some ethnic and religious minorities, it is even menacing.  To illustrate this point, Maxie Hayles, a veteran campaigner for racial equality, took me to a hotel in the puddled center of Birmingham, Britain’s second city. The hotel had long been refurbished, its floor plan altered, even its name changed. But finally, Mr. Hayles found a particular room.   This was the place where in 1968 Enoch Powell, a former government minister, made a notoriously racist speech claiming immigration would ruin Britain. To this day, that speech remains synonymous for some Britons with prejudice and division. Mr. Hayles, who was then a 25-year-old Jamaican immigrant, still remembers the fear it gave his community. Britain has since changed. A black-owned business now occupies Mr. Powell’s office. The hotel room has been divided in two, repaneled and recarpeted. But Brexit risks tearing up the metaphorical carpet again, Mr. Hayles warned. Racist attacks increased around the time of the referendum campaign, by about a fifth. The prime minister has compared hijab-wearers to mailboxes. And Mr. Powell has a modern-day cheerleader in Nigel Farage, Brexit’s biggest proponent. “We’re not into good times, in terms of Brexit and what it means for black minorities in Britain,” Mr. Hayles said. “It’s serious days ahead.” In London, at a rabbinical school in a 300-year-old manor house, I had lunch with Laura Janner-Klausner, the most senior rabbi in British Reform Judaism. She is no Brexit supporter, but she also fears prejudice from another quarter: Under Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party’s leadership has been slow to address instances of anti-Semitism. Addressing poverty is a moral issue for Jews, Rabbi Janner-Klausner said. “Which is why, in the past, the natural place for Jews in this country was the Labour party.” So while she and many Jewish voters have traditionally voted Labour — her father was a Labour lawmaker, as was his father before him — she will not in this election.  She is not alone. Several Labour lawmakers have quit in horror, including Luciana Berger, who is running in Rabbi Janner-Klausner’s constituency for the Liberal Democrats, a rival centrist party. And last month, the spiritual head of Britain’s Orthodox Jews said Mr. Corbyn’s leadership put at stake “the very soul of our nation.” Rabbi Janner-Klausner did not go as far. She said that the biggest threat to British minorities remained the far right. “But here,” she said, “I will vote for Luciana.” We turned left at the pink pub, through the mist, then up into the Welsh mountains. Down a track to the right stood the Davies farm. Ceri Davies was in the barn behind the house, checking the renovations. Wales does not loom large in British political discourse. Its independence movement is smaller than Scotland’s. But even in these remote uplands, something is nevertheless stirring, partly thanks to Brexit. Mr. Davies has lived all of his life in this single valley, barring three months in a nearby town. He speaks Welsh with friends and didn’t know a word of English until school. His father was a sheep farmer, and so is Mr. Davies. His 750 sheep grazed on the slopes above us. Brexit threatens that — hence the barn. Like many British farms, Mr. Davies’s business breaks even only because of a subsidy from the European Union. Worse still, Europe beyond Britain’s borders buys about a third of Welsh lamb. The Conservatives have promised to replace the subsidies with new payments. But if European officials place tariffs on British meat after Brexit, it might ruin farms like Mr. Davies’s. “It is pretty scary,” he said. So the barn, along with the lush meadow behind it, is his insurance. Mr. Davies and his wife, Rebecca Ingleby Davies, plan to turn the meadow into a luxury campsite, or “glampsite.” The barn will house the showers. There is an irony to it: Idealized as a return to British traditions and heritage, Brexit might instead finish some of them off. “This area is really built around farming,” Ms. Ingleby Davies said. “If you take that away, then you’re going to lose a massive amount of culture and community.”  Not to mention the Welsh language, which is spoken more often in rural areas. Mr. Davies is sanguine — he gets on with everybody, even the people whose Brexit votes might wreck his business. But Ms. Ingleby Davies finds it harder to forget. There are people she now avoids, certain gatherings she boycotts. That frustration has swelled into something more profound. She wants Wales to stay in the European Union — as an independent country. That is still a minority view. But polling suggests that up to a third of Welsh voters are warming to the idea as Brexit rumbles on and the specter of English nationalism rises. “I wouldn’t consider myself a nationalistic person,” Ms. Ingleby Davies said. But she thought that an independent Wales, protected by the European Union, would be “stronger than just being, you know, an afterthought in London.” The ferry slid from the Liverpool docks, past the red cranes and into the Irish Sea. Outside, the waves were gentle. In the canteen, passengers were seething. Alan Kinney set aside his tuna salad to make his point. “It would be a big, big betrayal,” he said. The cause of his anger was the sea itself: This stretch of water between two parts of the United Kingdom — Britain and Northern Ireland — has become the latest obstacle to Brexit. During the last decades of the 20th century, nationalists in Northern Ireland unsuccessfully fought to reunite the territory, which remains under British control, with the Republic of Ireland, which won independence in 1922. Most paramilitaries put down their arms in 1998, after a peace deal opened the land border between northern and southern Ireland. To avoid enforcing post-Brexit customs checks on that land border, Mr. Johnson has effectively agreed to treat the entire island of Ireland as a single customs area. Customs checks will instead be enforced on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland, in sea ferries like this one.  That might placate many Irish nationalists. But it has enraged the territory’s loyalists — Northern Irish residents, mainly from Protestant backgrounds, who want to remain within the United Kingdom. They feel the customs checks would create a reunified Ireland in all but name. Mr. Kinney, a member of the Orange Order, a hard-line loyalist group, pulled a magazine from his bag. “No to a sea border,” the centerfold read. “No to an economic united Ireland! No surrender!” The next article was about Catholic pedophiles. Three tables away, Tim McKee fortunately had not heard our conversation. A nationalist, Mr. McKee certainly did not want a land border. But a sea border was no good either: It might set off a violent backlash from loyalist paramilitaries. He feared a repeat of the 1970s, when he was nearly blown up by loyalist bomb. “Johnson’s actions,” he whispered, “are going to kill my friends.” Dotted throughout the cabins, several loyalists echoed Mr. Kinney and several nationalists agreed with Mr. McKee. But Susan and Jack Price bucked the trend. The Prices were Protestants by birth. But forced to choose, they would prefer a sea border within the United Kingdom to a land border with Ireland. Perhaps more surprisingly, both said Brexit had made them more supportive of Irish reunification. Though loyalist by background, they ultimately felt more attachment to Europe than Britain. “I just feel,” said Mr. Price, a teacher, “that being a European is more important.” In a wasteland on the edge of the Scottish town of Motherwell, our final stop, Tommy Brennan pointed out things that were no longer there. There had stood the factory gates, he said, there the cooling towers. This was once one of Europe’s biggest steelworks, where Mr. Brennan first worked in 1943. But now there was nothing but yellowing grass. Once bigger than Central Park, the Ravenscraig steelworks was shut and dismantled in 1992, after being privatized by London’s Conservative government. That put an estimated 10,000 residents out of work, including Mr. Brennan. In Shirebrook, I saw how deindustrialization eventually contributed to Brexit. But in Motherwell it helped heighten resentment of the British state rather than of Europe: In 2016, this area voted to stay in the European Union, but in a Scottish independence referendum in 2014 it favored leaving the United Kingdom. Mr. Brennan was among those voters — he had concluded that London would never prioritize Scottish interests. “If we’d been an independent nation when Ravenscraig closed,” he said, “it would never have closed.” Yet alienation takes many forms, even in the same town. After talking with Mr. Brennan, I crossed Motherwell to meet a woman born the year after the steelworks closed. With little permanent work in a post-steel Motherwell, Ashleigh Melia had spent her adult life in temporary jobs on the minimum wage. Now, in her work as a cleaner, employers sometimes send her away as soon as she arrives — there’s no work that day, and therefore no pay. The Conservatives’ decision to shrink the British state in recent years, cutting welfare payments by about $40 billion, has also squeezed her family. Her 4-year-old daughter, half blind and half deaf, has been denied disability allowances worth up to $460 a month.  Fired from her latest job in October, Ms. Melia now struggles to pay bills, her four children joining the 600,000 British minors who have fallen into poverty under the Conservatives. To cut electricity costs, she encourages them to play in the dark. But unlike with Mr. Brennan, all of this has not led to political engagement. Rushing from job interviews to hospital appointments, and with no internet at home, she had no time to think about politics. She couldn’t name most political parties. She had no opinion on Scottish independence.  It was a reminder of another reality — one in which many find it hard enough to live, without worrying how to vote.  The steelworks?  Ms. Melia had never heard of it.']",
Sweden Charges Ex-Ambassador to China Over Secret Meetings,2019-12-09,By Iliana Magra and Chris Buckley,"['Sweden’s former ambassador to China has been charged with “arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power,” after she held what Swedish prosecutors said on Monday were unauthorized meetings with two men representing Chinese state interests. The announcement of the charges was the latest twist in a four-year-old case, in which a Swedish citizen was spirited to China from Thailand, the ambassador held what the authorities say were secret meetings in a Stockholm hotel, and ties between China and Sweden have been strained. The former ambassador, Anna Lindstedt, was accused earlier this year of arranging the talks between Angela Gui, the daughter of Gui Minhai, a Swedish bookseller detained in China, and two Chinese men who had offered to help free Mr. Gui in January. Instead of talks about freeing her father, Ms. Gui said, she was pressured to keep silent. After the talks at a Stockholm hotel, Ms. Gui accused Ms. Lindstedt, the ambassador at the time, of arranging the talks without authorization from the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The ministry opened an internal investigation into Ms. Lindstedt in mid-February.   “In this specific consular matter, she has exceeded her mandate and has therefore rendered herself criminally liable,” Hans Ihrman, the deputy chief public prosecutor for Sweden’s National Security Unit, said in a statement on Monday. Mr. Ihrman said the charge of arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power was “unprecedented.”  “We have looked way back to find any kind of indictment for this, but in modern times we have no trail of an investigation,” he said in a telephone interview. Mr. Ihrman described the meeting as an attempt by Chinese officials to stop Ms. Gui’s criticism of the Chinese government because of the treatment of her father.  “It’s about this daughter’s right to freedom of speech, which they have tried to act upon,” he said.  Nevertheless, he said, Ms. Lindstedt acted on her own without the necessary support or permission from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  The charge can bring a maximum prison sentence of two years under the Swedish Penal Code. A trial date for Ms. Lindstedt has not been set, Mr. Ihrman said. The Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported Monday that prosecutors chose a milder charge than what the government’s security service had sought, “disloyalty when negotiating with a foreign power,” which carries up to a 10-year sentence. A lawyer for Ms. Lindstedt, Conny Cedermark, said Monday in an email  that no crime had been committed. “Arbitrary conduct in negotiation with a foreign power has a series of prerequisites,” he said, and none of them had been met in the case. Mr. Gui was one of five Hong Kong-based publishers who were abducted and taken to China in 2015 after publishing books that were critical of the Communist Party elite, setting off international condemnation.  After being taken from Thailand to China in 2015, he was formally released two years later but was not  allowed to leave the country.  Mr. Gui was again detained early last year, when two Swedish diplomats tried to accompany him on a train from Shanghai to Beijing, where they planned to take him into the Swedish Embassy. But Chinese police officers boarded the train and took him into custody.  They said later that Mr. Gui was suspected of illegally providing state secrets, but gave no details or evidence. Soon after, the Chinese authorities brought Mr. Gui before a group of reporters, and he told them that the Swedish diplomats had wanted to spirit him back to Sweden. Mr. Ihrman, the Swedish prosecutor, said on Monday that Mr. Gui was in a Chinese prison.  Relations between Sweden and China have been strained since Gui Minhai was kidnapped in 2015, and tensions increased last month when the Swedish office of the writers’ group PEN said that it was awarding a literary prize to Mr. Gui. The prize is given annually to an author or publisher who is persecuted, threatened or living in exile. Three days later, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm called the prize a “farce” and threatened consequences if members of the Swedish government were to attend the award ceremony. A week later, Amanda Lind, Sweden’s minister of culture, not only attended the ceremony but also awarded the prize, despite warnings from the Chinese ambassador that Ms. Lind and other government officials working in the area of culture would no longer be welcome in China. Late last month, China appeared to follow through on its warning, with  SVT reporting that two Swedish films had been banned from screenings in China. Last week, after a seminar in Gothenburg, Sweden, on Swedish-Chinese relations, the Chinese ambassador to Sweden, Gui Congyou, told the newspaper Goteborgs-Posten that China would limit trade with Sweden because of its handling of the Gui Minhai case. “No one can think that they can harm China’s interests and at the same time draw great profits in the country,” the ambassador told the newspaper on Wednesday. “We must of course take countermeasures.”  In an interview with Goteborgs-Posten, Gui Congyou was reticent and cryptic but said that reprisals would not  be limited to cultural exchanges. Asked what areas other than culture could be affected, he said, “we will inform your colleagues at your Foreign Ministry.” Jesper Bengtsson, the chairman of Swedish PEN, said the organization was surprised by the “amazingly” strong response from China to this year’s award. “Governments and regimes have often reacted but never with threats, and threatening to block ministers from visiting China, Mr. Bengtsson said in a telephone interview, adding that the Swedish culture minister always attends the award ceremony. Previous prize recipients include Nasrin Sotoudeh, the Iranian human rights lawyer who is serving a 38-year prison sentence after being convicted of crimes against national security, and Dawit Isaak, a Swedish-Eritrean journalist who was arrested in Eritrea in 2001 on  security charges and has been imprisoned without a trial ever since. Christina Anderson contributed reporting.

Sanna Marin of Finland to Become World’s Youngest Prime Minister,2019-12-09,By Johanna Lemola and Megan Specia,"['HELSINKI, Finland — Sanna Marin, 34, is set to become the world’s youngest sitting prime minister when she is sworn in this week in Finland, after being elected to the position by her party late Sunday.  The country’s coalition government consists of five parties, four of which are led by women, with Ms. Marin now at the helm. Four of the women are under the age of 35, which Finnish political experts say is more significant, symbolic of the rise of a new generation of politicians in the Nordic nation, which has had strong female representation for decades. “The past week has been extraordinary,” she told reporters, according to Helsingin Sanomat, a leading Finnish newspaper. “Now is the time to look ahead. What is needed now is action beyond words to build trust from all government parties.” Formerly the country’s transportation minister, Ms. Marin was voted in by fellow lawmakers in her Social Democratic Party after a turbulent week in which Prime Minister Antti Rinne resigned over his handling of a postal workers strike.  Although Mr. Rinne will continue as head of the party, Parliament is expected to confirm Ms. Marin as prime minister as soon as Tuesday, depending on how quickly the other coalition parties name their ministers. Once sworn in, she will be Finland’s youngest prime minister to date and its third female prime minister.  Ms. Marin, a left-leaning liberal, has been a member of Parliament since 2015. She began her political career in 2012, when she was elected to the local council in the southern city of Tampere. Most recently she was minister of transportation and communications in Mr. Rinne’s government.  Serving as Mr. Rinne’s deputy when he took an extended sick leave earlier this year, she helped lead their party to a narrow win in national elections.  Alexander Stubb, who was Finland’s prime minister from 2014 to 2015, posted on Twitter that having a government led by women “shows that #Finland is a modern and progressive country.” “One day, gender will not matter in government,” he wrote. “Meanwhile pioneers.” Of the five women in leading ministerial positions in the coalition, four are under 35. Asked about her age after it was announced that she would be prime minister, Ms. Marin reiterated what she has said numerous times: Age doesn’t matter. “I have not actually ever thought about my age or my gender,” she said, according to the national news outlet YLE. “I think of the reasons I got into politics and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate.”  She outlined her political ethos in a letter to fellow party members ahead of the decision on Sunday, asking for their support. She noted that she had benefited from the welfare state throughout her life, especially during “difficult times” and said that ensuring its strength was a priority for her. “I got to live a safe childhood, have an education and pursue my dreams,” she wrote. “Enabling it for everyone has driven me into politics.” While Ms. Marin’s new role has drawn attention globally, Anne Holli, a political science professor at the University of Helsinki, said it was unsurprising, in Finland where women’s representation in Parliament has been strong for decades. In the 1983 election, women held 30 percent of the seats. By the 2007 election, they made up more than 40 percent of lawmakers, and they make up 47 percent in the parliamentary term that began this year. “We have actually a very broad base of women in politics, and we have had a pretty equal situation in the political sphere for more than 35 years,” Ms. Holli said. “I think one can kind of expect this sooner or later.” She said the sudden attention to the young female lawmakers has been jarring. “Nobody has been calling me when there are young male party leaders,” she said.  Ms. Holli said it was the youth of Ms. Marin and her fellow government leaders that was unusual, rather than their gender. “It’s kind of a change of generations,” she said. Ms. Marin won the leadership vote by a small margin, and her skills will be put to the test immediately as the country heads into a season of labor negotiations with the potential for strikes. Her predecessor, Mr. Rinne, was ultimately forced out of office after he made comments about a plan to cut wages for postal workers and his coalition partner, the Center Party, said it had lost confidence in him. Despite his resignation, the coalition’s parties will remain unaltered: Ms. Marin’s Social Democratic Party as Finland’s biggest, the Center Party, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland.  The Social Democratic Party will vote at its convention next June to determine whether Mr. Rinne will continue to lead the party or whether Ms. Marin or someone else will formally take over. Many analysts say Ms. Marin is likely to win the contest for party leadership.  The coalition government under Ms. Marin is expected to continue prioritizing job creation and ambitious climate goals, seeking to render Finland carbon neutral by 2035. Tuomas Yla-Anttila, an associate professor of political science at the University of Helsinki said that Ms. Marin’s appointment as prime minister has symbolic value in the country, but is also a reflection of strides in gender equality.  “For a long time we had the situation in Finland where there were only men, now there are women, sometimes it goes the other way round,” he said, pointing to the all-female government leadership.  He said Ms. Marin’s youth likely helped her win the support of the troubled Social Democratic Party as it looks to reform and move away from the politics of Mr. Rinne. In Finland, he added, her age was a more important political factor than her sex. “The party surely wanted a younger prime minister,” he said. “Her young age is more important than being a woman. She represents a new generation of politicians.” Jenni Karimaki, a senior researcher at the Center for Parliamentary Studies at the University of Turku, said that in many ways Ms. Marin was a natural choice. She is the first deputy of the party and has served as a government minister, positions that traditionally have been springboards to the prime minister’s office.  “There is demand at the moment for young women in key positions,” Ms. Karimaki said, and pointed to the fact that many other young, female politicians won office in April’s national election. Ms. Karimaki said Ms. Marin also symbolized the new start that the Social Democrats have been looking for and represented “a strengthening of representative democracy.” “Now the picture is changing of what kind of people can bear high-level political responsibility,” she said. Johanna Lemola reported from Helsinki, and Megan Specia from London. ']","At 34, Ms. Marin will head a coalition made up of five parties, in a government led by women. "
India Steps Toward Making Naturalization Harder for Muslims,2019-12-09,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj,"['HYDERABAD, India — India took a major step toward the official marginalization of Muslims on Tuesday as one house of Parliament passed a bill that would establish a religious test for migrants who want to become citizens, solidifying Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist agenda.  The measure would give migrants of all of South Asia’s major religions a clear path to Indian citizenship — except Islam. It is the most significant move yet to profoundly alter India’s secular nature enshrined by its founding leaders when the country gained independence in 1947.  The bill passed in the lower house, the Lok Sabha, a few minutes after midnight, following a few hours of debate. The vote was 311 to 80. The measure now moves to the upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where Mr. Modi seems to have enough allies that most analysts predict it will soon become law.  Muslim Indians are deeply unsettled. They see the new measure, called the Citizenship Amendment Bill, as the first step by the governing party to make second-class citizens of India’s 200 million Muslims, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, and render many of them stateless. [Update: Protests spread across India over divisive citizenship law.] “We are heading toward totalitarianism, a fascist state,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim lawmaker, who on Monday dramatically tore up a copy of the bill while giving a speech in Parliament. “We are making India a theocratic country.” The legislation goes hand in hand with a contentious program that began in the northeastern state of Assam this year, in which all 33 million residents of the state had to prove, with documentary evidence, that they or their ancestors were Indian citizens. Approximately two million people — many of them Muslims, and many of them lifelong residents of India — were left off the state’s citizenship rolls after that exercise.  Now, Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is hoping to expand that kind of citizenship test to other states. And the new legislation would become a guiding principle for who could hope to call themselves Indians. Mr. Modi and his party are deeply rooted in an ideology that sees India as a Hindu nation. And since the B.J.P.’s landslide re-election win in May, Mr. Modi’s administration has celebrated one Hindu nationalist victory after another, each a demoralizing drumbeat for Muslims.  First came the Assam citizenship tests. Then Mr. Modi stripped away autonomy and statehood for Kashmir, which used to be India’s only Muslim-majority state. And last month, Hindu fundamentalists scored a big court victory allowing them to build a new temple over the ruins of a demolished mosque in the flash point city of Ayodhya.  With the new citizenship bill, Mr. Modi’s party says it is simply trying to protect persecuted Hindus, Buddhists and Christians (and members of a few smaller religions) who migrate from predominantly Muslim countries such as Pakistan or Afghanistan. But the legislation would also make it easier to incarcerate and deport Muslim residents, even those whose families have been in India for generations, if they cannot produce proof of citizenship.  Under Mr. Modi’s leadership, anti-Muslim sentiment has become blatantly more mainstream and public. Intimidation and attacks against Muslim communities have increased in recent years. And overt displays of Hindu piety and nationalism have become central in pop culture and politics. Mr. Modi’s fellow lawmakers in the B.J.P. are unapologetic about their pro-Hindu position.  “There are Muslim countries, there are Jew countries, everybody has their own identity. And we are a billion-plus, right? We must have one identity,” said Ravi Kishan, a famous action-film hero and member of Parliament who is a central supporter of the citizenship legislation.  When asked if he was trying to turn India into a Hindu nation, he laughed. “India has always been a Hindu nation,” he said. “The Muslims also are Hindus.” (This is a common Hindu nationalist belief: that India’s Muslims are relatively recent converts, even though Islam arrived in India hundreds of years ago.) Even before lawmakers in the Lok Sabha voted,  protests were breaking out.  In Assam, where the citizenship program began last summer, thousands of people have marched in the streets, hoisting placards and torches and shouting out their opposition to the bill.  People are talking of mass fasts and boycotts of schools and markets. On Monday, some hanged effigies of Mr. Modi and his right-hand man, Amit Shah, the home minister.  The leaders of the opposition Indian National Congress party are trying to paint the bill as a danger to India’s democracy. After India won its independence, its founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru among them, made a clear decision: Even though the country was 80 percent Hindu, it would not be an officially Hindu nation. Minorities, especially Muslims, would be treated equally. Rahul Gandhi, a party leader and great-grandson of Mr. Nehru, said, “India belongs to everybody — all communities, all religions, all cultures.” Shashi Tharoor, the party’s intellectual heavyweight, called the bill an “all-out assault on the very idea of India.” But the Congress party is at a low point in its 100-year-plus history. And Mr. Modi’s party has the numbers: With allies, it controls nearly two-thirds of the seats in the lower house.  Some of Mr. Modi’s critics believe the bill is serving to distract the public from another pressing issue: the economy. For the first time in decades, India’s economy is slowing significantly. It is still huge, but several big industries, like car and motorcycle manufacturing, have seen sales plummet like never before.  “The economy is in tatters,” said Aman Wadud, a human rights lawyer in Assam. The bill, he said, was “the only issue left to polarize the country and distract people.” But forging India into an overtly Hindu nation has been a core goal of Mr. Modi’s party and of the R.S.S., a right-wing volunteer group whose ranks Mr. Modi rose up through and which provides him a backbone of support. And India’s recent moves in Kashmir, along with the Ayodhya temple ruling and the Assam citizenship tests, have been hugely popular with the prime minister’s base. Earlier this year, Mr. Modi’s government tried to push similar citizenship legislation. The bill sailed through the lower house but stalled after many politicians in Assam said they did not like the religious dimension the B.J.P. was injecting — or the possibility that a large number of Hindu Bengalis would be made citizens and would be able to legally acquire land in Assam. The bill gathered new momentum this fall, after the citizenship test in Assam. Assam has witnessed waves of migration over the years, and many of those people whose citizenship was being questioned were migrants, both Hindus and Muslims, from neighboring Bangladesh.  Mr. Shah, the home minister and architect of the B.J.P.’s recent political victories, promised to protect the Hindus and other non-Muslims. He has called illegal migrants from Bangladesh “termites,” and along with his other statements made clear that Muslims were his target. Mr. Shah has also promised to impose the citizenship test from Assam on the entire country.  The citizenship bill is a piece of the campaign to identify and deport Muslims who have been living in India for years, critics of the bill say. It lays out a path to Indian citizenship for migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan if they can prove they have been in India for at least five years and ascribe to the specified religions.  To overcome the resistance from politicians in Assam, who do not want Hindu or Muslim migrants taking their land, the new version of the bill carves out special protections for areas predominated by indigenous people. Mr. Modi’s supporters employ a certain logic when defending the bill’s exclusion of Muslims. They say Muslims are not persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan, which is mostly true. They also say that when India and Pakistan were granted independence in 1947, the British carved out Pakistan as a haven for Muslims, while India remained predominantly Hindu. To them, the extension of that process is to ask illegal Muslims migrants to leave India and seek refuge in neighboring, mainly Muslim nations. Article 25 of the Indian Constitution says, “All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.” Given that, many opponents of the bill say the citizenship legislation is patently unconstitutional. But the Hindu nationalists have an answer for that, as well. “We are not talking about citizens,” said Ramesh Shinde, a spokesman for the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, a Hindu organization that is considered a far-right group. “We are talking about migrants.” Both sides agree on one thing: The bill could have far-reaching consequences.  The Indian government is already racing to build an enormous network of prisons to house thousands of migrants. If immigration law is applied selectively, Hindu migrants who are swept up in raids may be released and allowed to apply for citizenship, while Muslim migrants could instead be sent to detention camps, opponents say. “In every state, Muslims are running around for papers,” said Mr. Wadud, the human rights lawyer in Assam. “An environment of fear has been created.” Mr. Kishan, the action hero turned politician, said he would next push to change India’s name to Bharat, the traditional Hindi word for India. But he said that he was not anti-Muslim, and that Muslims living in India legally had nothing to fear.  “How can I be anti-Muslim? My staff in Mumbai is Muslim,” he said.  “Hindus and Muslims in India are like this,” he said, interlacing his fingers. “But,” he added with a big smile, “I love Hindus.” Jeffrey Gettleman reported from Hyderabad, India, and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.

Young Voters Helped Upend Last U.K. Election. Can It Happen Again?,2019-12-08,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['SOUTHAMPTON, England — As students from the University of Southampton zigzagged across campus on a recent cold afternoon, youthful activists with Britain’s main opposition Labour Party intercepted them with cups of tea and a leaflet with detailed instructions on how to register to vote in December’s election.  “Vote for jobs, vote for housing, vote for youth services, vote for the climate,” the campaigners chanted, as students gathered around them to learn more.  Brexit, generally supported by older generations, is seen by many young people as a threat to their ability to travel, study or work abroad, and continues to be one of the most important issues for youth voters, alongside the environment, education and housing, according to an analysis by YouGov, an internet market research firm based in Britain. In the 2017 general election, a dominant performance among young people helped Labour win enough seats to unexpectedly deprive the governing Conservative Party of its parliamentary majority.  Now, as Britain prepares for its most pivotal election in decades on Thursday, Labour is targeting cities with high youth populations, hoping that they will offset losses in traditional Labour strongholds in the north that support Brexit by healthy margins. The excitement is often palpable among college students, many of them first-time voters who did not have a chance to participate in the 2016 Brexit referendum that has upended their lives. “This election is the most significant of our time. It will determine our future,” said Harriet Farmer, 19, a student at the University of Southampton. “Young people are always overlooked, but in this election, we will make ourselves heard. We are engaged, we have registered and we will vote our way out of this mess.”  The intergenerational gap in support between the two main parties was so wide in the 2017 election that YouGov declared that age had replaced class as the dividing line in British politics. Over 60 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 backed the Labour Party in 2017, while 69 percent of voters over the age of 70 backed the Conservative Party. That divide was driven by opposition both to Brexit and to the government’s decade-long austerity policy. One of the big questions in this election is whether young voters, who tend to be underrepresented in opinion polls, could spring a surprise. More than 1.5 million people under the age of 34 registered to vote between Oct. 22 and Nov. 19, compared with 1.2 million in the same time frame in 2017, government figures show. An additional 452,000 people under the age of 34 applied to vote on the last day of registration on Nov. 26. Analysts caution that while the numbers hint at the possibility of an explosive turnout, they could be overstating the potential impact. That’s because students are allowed to register twice, in their hometowns and in their university towns, but must choose a single place to vote.  Despite the surge in youth registration, the percentage of registered young voters, at around two-thirds, remains low compared with the older population. Young people also make up a big percentage of nonvoters: Only between 40 and 50 percent of the population between the ages of 18 and their mid-20s voted in the 2015 and 2017 elections, compared with about 80 percent of voters in their 70s. When Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a December general election last month, Johnny Maclean, a 19-year-old fashion student, was delighted. Too young to vote in the 2016 European Union referendum, but ardently anti-Brexit, he would finally have his say.  After reading the policy platforms of the main opposition parties, Mr. Maclean concluded that the Labour Party offered the best opportunities for young people.  “They are promising the largest youth investment out of any other major U.K. party,” he said in a recent interview. “They are promising the full scrapping of tuition fees, free bus travel for all under 25s, raise the minimum wage to £10 and mass invest into youth services to reverse and go beyond the one billion cuts in youth services by the Tories.” While young voters tend to favor the Labour Party, the youth vote shows the same tendency toward fragmentation as the wider British left. Many have shifted to the Liberal Democrats, a more centrist party with an adamantly anti-Brexit stance, and the Greens. James Sloam, the author of “Youthquake 2017: The Rise of Young Cosmopolitans in Britain,” believes that youth turnout will be high this week. “All the evidence shows that if you vote in your first election it becomes a habit, so young voters from 2017 would be likely to vote again as well as first-time voters,” he said. Dr. Sloam’s research found that in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008 young people, having borne the brunt of austerity, unemployment and cuts to services, have become more politically engaged. With so much at stake in the coming election, young people are also opting to vote tactically. The constituency of Southampton Itchen is home to students from two universities — the University of Southampton and Solent University — and many graduates stay on to work in the city, which is a major port. In 2017, the Conservative candidate, Royston Smith, won by 31 votes, making it a prime target for Labour this time. Many young residents of the city believe the youth vote will swing the seat to Labour. “I changed my registration from my parent’s house in Hereford to Itchen, just so that we have a bigger chance at knocking the Tories off the bench,” said Imogen Williams, a 24-year-old computer programmer who works in Southampton. “I just want to stop Brexit, and I know that if Labour wins and calls a second referendum people will vote differently, now that they have actual facts about what a monumental disaster Brexit would be for our country.” Ms. Williams’s sister, Martha, a student at Southampton University, said many of her friends would be voting for the first time and were divided between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. “Labour is a fantastic party for the youth, but Jeremy Corbyn is a terrible leader and no one can imagine him as prime minister,” she said. “And then we have the Lib Dems who say they will cancel Brexit, but they aren’t going to get a majority, so people are in a pickle and are just choosing to vote tactically instead of idealistically.” Even though Mr. Corbyn has lost popularity since the last election, following accusations of anti-Semitism and his refusal to take a personal stance on Brexit, youth support for his party appears to be gathering momentum once again. “The Labour Party policies may appear radical to some,” Dr. Sloam said. “But with the exception of their ambiguous policy on Brexit, they are extremely popular and their campaign seems to be galvanizing young voters.”  While many young people express enthusiasm and even hope about the vote, some detect more negative currents. “We have a really large majority of students that are really engaged, but I would say that they are more angry than excited, because they don’t like the fact that they have been marginalized,” said Emily Harrison, president of the student union at Southampton University. “And of course, you do have some students who are apathetic, that feel like their vote doesn’t make a difference, so part of our campaign at the moment is to encourage students to vote.” Charlie Corbett, 20, a first-time voter who has already mailed in his postal ballot, said he had registered only because his parents had pressured him. He stood out for not sharing his fellow students’ enthusiasm for defeating the Tories and Mr. Johnson’s drive to “get Brexit done.” “I want to stay in the E.U.,” he said. “But at this point I’d rather leave than go around another five years in circles. I voted for Boris, he’s the only person who will get this done and that’s all I want at this point. Just to leave and move on.”']","The left-wing opposition Labour Party outperformed most polls in 2017 thanks in part to its strength among young people, who appear to have registered in larger numbers this time around."
"As Water Runs Low, Can Life in the Outback Go On?",2019-12-08,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['EUCHAREENA, Australia — Fleur Magick Dennis has stopped showering every day, allowed her vegetable patch to die and told her four sons to let the dishes pile up. Sometimes, all her family has is bottled water, and they have to preserve every drop. A year and a half ago, the reservoir in their town, Euchareena, went dry, leaving the family and some other residents without running water.  “I didn’t think I’d be in this position, trying to fight for water for basic human needs in Australia,” Ms. Magick Dennis said.  As a crippling drought and mismanagement have left more than a dozen Australian towns and villages without a reliable source of water, the country is beginning to confront a question that strikes at its very identity: Is life in Australia’s vast interior compatible with the age of climate change? In the outback — a landscape central to Australian lore, far removed in distance and spirit from the coastal metropolises — rivers and lakes are disappearing, amplifying fears that wide swaths of rural territory may eventually have to be abandoned. Euchareena and Australian towns like it are far from alone. A quarter of humanity lives in countries that are using almost all the water they have, according to data published by the World Resources Institute in August. Shortages have plagued places from California to Cape Town, South Africa, which narrowly escaped running out of water last year.  But Australia, the most arid inhabited continent, is unique among developed nations in its vulnerability to the effects of climate change, scientists say. With the country’s driest spring on record just concluded and another hot, parched summer likely to be ahead, the challenge of keeping Australia hydrated is only becoming more urgent. “People think about climate change as this very faraway prospect, but in fact, it’s here now,” said Joelle Gergis, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Australian National University in Canberra and an author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “We’re starting to glimpse what the future is going to be like,” Dr. Gergis added. “It’s possible that parts of Australia will become uninhabitable.” Australia’s cities — which rely on expansive dams and, increasingly, plants that transform seawater into drinking water — may be able to sustain themselves even in the driest conditions, policy experts say.  However, “as soon as you go inland and you don’t have the ocean, we’re not going to be fine, and I don’t think anyone knows what the solution is,” said Ian Wright, a senior lecturer in environmental science at Western Sydney University, who worked with Sydney’s water utility for more than a decade.  “It is so dire right now; I’d say it’s an absolute crisis,” Dr. Wright added. “It’s beyond desperate.” Farming families and Indigenous communities, which in their different ways have carefully managed the land’s scarce resources, may have to relocate. Australia’s tourism industry, which has always heavily promoted the outback as a destination, could also suffer.  And with fire season off to a ferocious start, towns like Euchareena live in fear that they might not be able to stop any blazes that ignite.  We’re a “tinderbox waiting to go up,” Ms. Magick Dennis, 40, said as she waited on her porch for a water truck to reach the village, a dusty strip of homes in a region of fewer than 200 residents a four-hour drive from Sydney. Atop a hill sits a 20,000-gallon tank, the only resource residents have to fight a fire. It hasn’t always been like this in Euchareena.  Ms. Magick Dennis and her children used to enjoy swimming at the village dam in the summer. Now, though, the creek bed is littered with dead reeds and mussel shells; the surrounding eucalyptus trees are exposed at the roots.  “It’s beyond going, ‘Oh, it’s going to rain soon and it will get better,’” said Ms. Magick Dennis, who has considered moving. “The ecosystem is really damaged.” In rural Australia, that damage often results from a complex interplay of mismanagement, drought and climate change.  The conservative Australian government has approved water-intensive mining projects and made contentious deals with agribusiness — agreements that are often blamed for the degradation of the country’s waterways, which sustain dozens of communities and hundreds of native plant and animal species. A lack of investment has also put the country behind nations like the United States and China in its ability to model future climate and water scenarios, said Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Climate Extremes in Sydney. At the same time, Australia’s dry and variable climate is becoming even drier and more unpredictable. Parts of the country are experiencing less rain, and the floods that usually fill rivers, lakes and dams are decreasing, scientists say.  This is happening as the country’s growing population puts increasing demands on its water. “That’s not a very good set of circumstances to find yourself in,” Professor Pitman said. Across New South Wales, the state where the drought that began in 2017 has hit hardest, plots of abandoned, parched land stretch for miles. The occasional green pasture is a sign of a farmer battling the elements, and probably wealthy enough to irrigate.  “If the drought went on for another four years, that would be Armageddon for Australia,” said James Hamilton, who farms land about 270 miles inland from Sydney. He, like many others, has not planted any crops this year and plans to sell off his remaining livestock. The reservoir on Mr. Hamilton’s 6,000-acre property is empty, and the land where knee-high wheat should be flourishing this time of year is desiccated. Farmers are used to harsh conditions, but Mr. Hamilton worries that businesses in small towns are less likely to bounce back from the drought, given the cascading economic effects. “Nothing is sustainable without water,” he said. The largest nearby town, Dubbo, which has a population of about 40,000, relies on water from the Macquarie River, which could stop flowing by May, according to the local council. The Burrendong Dam reservoir, which feeds the river, is currently at about 3 percent of its capacity.  Already, the town — where temperatures can reach 115 degrees in the summer — has stopped watering some public spaces, and each resident is restricted to 280 liters of water per day, about 74 gallons. (Residents pushed back against tighter limits that included turning off evaporate air-conditioning between midnight and 7 a.m.) The local zoo, one of the largest in Australia, is recycling water and has replaced some garden beds with synthetic turf. The fire station is exploring alternative means to smother blazes, like sand and foam.  If the river runs dry, Dubbo would have to rely on its wells, which currently supply just a portion of its water. (Ms. Magick Dennis is petitioning to have one dug as a backup for Euchareena.)  But in some parts of Australia, low-quality groundwater has caused problems.  In towns north of Dubbo, residents have reported foul-smelling, metallic-tasting water, as well as medical problems like high blood pressure and skin conditions. Some said they had received no warning that the water might be unsafe to drink. “At the worst, it tastes like you bit your cheek and it was bleeding,” said Fleur Thompson, a resident of Bourke, a town in the state’s northwest. In Australia’s cities, the picture is somewhat less bleak, but even there, water supplies are running short. The reservoir at Sydney’s dam is less than half full, and the city has employed “water officers” to educate citizens and enforce restrictions.  The government of Victoria has ruled out building more dams to serve rural areas and the city of Melbourne, because river flow in that state is expected to drop by half by 2065. Possible solutions include recycling water and relying on desalination plants, which are often criticized for their high energy use and the potential environmental harm of ejecting brine back into the ocean. These methods are crucial, though, if Australia is to remain livable under dire climate change scenarios, policy experts say.  “We can’t let ourselves off the hook; no matter what the impact of climate change, we need to plan,” said Stuart White, the director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology in Sydney.  In early November, rain finally fell across parts of New South Wales, providing some relief and hope as people reveled in the puddles. But the drought is far from over, and the question of whether Australia will learn and adapt will linger on.

"After Eruption in New Zealand, 5 Dead, 8 Missing and ‘No Signs of Life’",2019-12-09,By Jamie Tarabay and Damien Cave,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — They had taken boats to a desolate island to get a glimpse of a natural wonder, but when the White Island volcano erupted on Monday,  a scene of stunning beauty suddenly turned into a deadly trap.  At least five people were killed when the volcano erupted on the island  off the eastern coast of New Zealand, eight were still missing and 31 remained hospitalized with burns and other injuries. Three more people had been hospitalized and released.  Reconnaissance flights over the area have found no signs of life. “To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your unfathomable grief at this moment in time and in your sorrow,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a news conference in Whakatane, a coastal community near the volcano. “Our duty,” she added, “is to return loved ones.” The New Zealand authorities said a criminal investigation had been opened in the aftermath of the eruption, in addition to a formal inquiry by the country’s work safety commission. A New Zealand deputy police commissioner, John Tims, said emergency personnel were still trying to gain access to the island, but were being held up by the risk of further eruptions and rough wind conditions that had grounded an attempt to get drones above the island for reconnaissance. “We understand the desire from the locals and the loved ones to remove their family from the island but we are working round the clock, we are working hard, and we understand what we need to do for friends and family,” he said. The challenge of  recovery and the scale of the disaster caused by the volcano — which has been promoted for decades as live and active but relatively safe to visit — played out overnight and into Tuesday morning as officials described dangerous helicopter flights to look for survivors and attempts to treat the wounded.  Among the missing or injured were tourists from Australia, China, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States, along with tour operators from New Zealand.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said in a statement that 24 Australians had been on White Island,  13 of whom are hospitalized. As many as three of the five confirmed dead are Australian, as are many of the missing. There were also nine Americans on the island on Monday. On Tuesday morning, relatives gathered at the Port of Tauranga where two large cruise ships sat docked, as officials interviewed people aboard.  On the Ovation of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean ship from which several groups of tourists went to the volcano just before it erupted, no one was being allowed to disembark.  Officials said 47 people were on White Island when it erupted. Dozens more were cruising the area in smaller boats. “It looked like a nuclear bomb going off,” said one witness who spoke to Radio New Zealand.  Others described a slowly emerging cloud of smoke and ash, seen from the water, and the suddenly horrifying realization that some people were still there.  “This is so hard to believe,” said Michael Schade, a visitor from San Francisco, who posted photos and video of his group’s departure from White Island moments after the eruption. “Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not 30 minutes before.”  Twenty-three people, including the five dead, were evacuated on Monday, said Mr. Tims,  the deputy police commissioner.  Among the missing are people who were seen on a webcam exploring the upper reaches of the volcano’s crater just before the eruption at 2:11 p.m. local time, Reuters reported.  Ms. Ardern said that the tourists on White Island seemed to have had little time to seek shelter before the “very significant” eruption occurred.  The island, also known as Whakaari, is privately owned and is typically visited by thousands of tourists every year, many of them drawn by promotions for “New Zealand’s most active volcano.” For Whakatane, a town of about 20,000 that’s a hub for White Island tours, the volcano’s appeal to visitors is an important part of the local economy. “The whole tourist industry revolves around the island,” said Phil van Dusschoten, a retired police officer who now runs a company that operates dive and fishing trips.  “It’s a somber atmosphere,” he said in a telephone interview on Tuesday morning, adding that the smell of sulfur was still wafting in the air. Mr. van Dusschoten said he was working on his boat when he saw the 12,000-foot tall ash clouds billowing from White Island. He said he later saw a busload of people, all of whom were shirtless, who had likely been rescued from the island. “For the last 30 plus years, we’ve operated without incident, allowing tens of thousands of tourists to visit the volcano,” he said. “It’s very sad.” On Monday, enveloped in the searing ash, White Island was too dangerous for emergency workers to reach. Mr. Tims told an afternoon news conference there had been no communication with anyone still on the island. Ash and smoke made it difficult for cameras pointed toward the volcano to see anyone on the island. “We know the urgency to go back to the island,” he told reporters. Ms. Ardern traveled Monday to Whakatane. “I know that there will be a huge amount of anxiety for those who had loved ones on the island at the time,” she said.  Tourists from the Royal Caribbean cruise ship were among those who visited the island on Monday, the company said, but the company did not say how many went or address their fate. Mr. Tims, the police commissioner, said the police were scheduled to receive a list of those who had gone to the island. A Royal Caribbean spokesman, Jonathon Fishman, said the company was “working together with local authorities, and providing all the help and care we can to our guests and their families, including offering medical resources and counseling.”  The eruption was reported to have occurred at 2:11 p.m. local time.  Directly after the eruption, GeoNet, the agency that monitors geological activity in New Zealand, raised its volcanic alert level to four. By about 4.30 p.m., it was decreased to Level 3, with the agency noting there was no further escalation in volcanic activity. The police have established a no-fly zone around the island and warned people living near areas that might be affected by falling ash to remain indoors and listen to the radio or television for news updates. Ash fall can contain jagged particles of abrasive rock or natural glass, and anyone exposed to it was advised to wear a dust mask or use a cloth handkerchief to cover their noses and mouths and wear goggles to protect their eyes.  Ken Gledhill, from the research institute GNS Science, likened the eruption to the volcano “clearing its throat,” and said that while it looked like it had quietened down, the authorities could not be certain there would not be another eruption within the next 24 hours. The volcano is New Zealand’s most active.  People were allowed to visit the island even after GeoNet had earlier issued bulletins warning of “moderate volcanic unrest” with “substantial gas, steam and mud bursts” observed at the crater lake.  “We’ve issued two or three bulletins in the last few weeks about the increase in activity,” Brad Scott, a GeoNet volcanologist, said in an interview.  He said that even though the volcano has been erupting since 2011, tourists have been undeterred, with visits to the island dating to the late 1800s. He said the agency passed its information on the volcano’s activity to tour operators and the police, but tourists make their own decisions about whether to visit the island. “The weather has traditionally been the only thing that has stopped visitors,” he said, noting that the volcano sits in the open ocean and people wanting to reach it have to contend with rough waters to make the journey. Royal Caribbean Cruises did not say whether it had known of the warnings about the volcanic activity.  The last time there was a large number of fatalities on White Island had nothing to do with a volcanic eruption.

"In First Meeting With Putin, Zelensky Plays to a Draw Despite a Bad Hand",2019-12-09,By Andrew Higgins,"['PARIS — It had the makings of a singularly unequal contest: a former K.G.B. officer and seasoned master of no-holds-barred global intrigue versus a former comedian bereft of any experience in power politics and battered by his country’s bruising encounters with President Trump. But the first face-to-face meeting on Monday between President Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s ruler for nearly 20 years, and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, turned out to be less a walkover for Mr. Putin than a draw, with modest progress made on calming five and half years of war in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky, who has been in office for just six months, said Russia and Ukraine had reached an agreement to exchange all prisoners by the end of the year and to fully implement a cease-fire first agreed to in 2015 but repeatedly broken. “I would like to have seen more,” said Mr. Zelensky, speaking at a joint news conference late Monday in Paris with Mr. Putin and the leaders of France and Germany, who were refereeing the meeting.  Mr. Zelensky added that it “is vital for Ukraine to restore control of the entire length of its border” with Russia in eastern Ukraine, which is currently controlled by separatist forces backed by Moscow. At the same news conference, Mr. Putin said relations with Ukraine, which had been in a deep freeze since a popular uprising toppled the pro-Russian Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in Feb. 2014, were now in a “thaw.” But he added that much needed to be done to achieve a stable settlement.  He stressed Russia’s longstanding position that the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine, under the control of armed rebels supported by Moscow since 2014, should be given special status.  A peace deal reached in the Belarus capital of Minsk in February 2015 required Ukraine to change its laws and Constitution to provide for such a status but, like most elements of the Minsk agreement, this has not been put into effect. President Emmanuel Macron of France expressed hope that the summit, the first high-level peace talks in three years, had broken years of stalemate, while acknowledging that peace was still not at hand in a war that has killed more than 13,000 combatants and civilians. “We have not found a magic wand or a silver bullet, but we have relaunched the peace process,” he said. The Paris meeting, he added, was “a very positive step forward.”  The four leaders agreed to meet again in four months. Mr. Zelensky, under mounting pressure at home from nationalists who accuse him of capitulating to Russia, arrived in Paris with limited room to maneuver and far fewer military or political resources to call on than Mr. Putin. His previous gestures of good will, notably the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the front line, have won no reciprocal steps by Russia or the rebels it supports in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. His position was further weakened by the absence of strong support from the United States, something that Ukraine had previously relied on as it struggles to hold its own on the battlefield against Russian troops — which the Kremlin has insisted are not serving soldiers but merely Russians “on vacation” — as well as armed separatists supported by Moscow. The United States was never been formally involved in shaping or enacting the Minsk agreement, but under President Barack Obama it played a central role in “lassoing the various sides,” said Alina Polyakova, a fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Mr. Trump has been besieged by impeachment hearings focused on his dealings with Ukraine — specifically, an American delay in delivering promised military aid and the withholding of a much-coveted White House meeting for Mr. Zelensky — and by criticism of repeated foreign policy shifts that favor Mr. Putin. Perhaps as a result, the American president has shown little inclination to get involved in the nitty-gritty details of settling the war, telling Mr. Zelensky when they met in New York in September: “I really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.” Many Trump administration officials who advocated supporting Ukraine in its struggle against Russia have resigned or been sidelined. The State Department’s special envoy for Ukraine and its point man for settling the conflict in the east, Kurt D. Volker, resigned in September. What Ms. Polyakova described as “U.S. absenteeism” has left the task of mediating a settlement in Europe’s only active war in the hands of Angela Merkel, Germany’s lame-duck chancellor, and Mr. Marcon, who has in recent months tilted to a more conciliatory approach toward Russia.  As if to illustrate the imbalance between Russia and Ukraine, at the Élysée Palace, where each president was saluted on Monday by a French honor guard, Mr. Zelensky arrived first in a modest gray Renault minivan, followed by Mr. Putin in an Aurus, a massive, Russian-made armored limousine. Mr. Putin, as he often does, arrived late, but only by a few minutes. Both leaders had much to gain from the meeting. Mr. Putin desperately wants the West to lift sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea and its sponsorship of the separatists. Mr. Zelensky, a political neophyte, won a landslide victory in Ukraine’s April presidential election on promises to end the fighting. Mr. Zelensky also had much to lose, but unlike his predecessor, Petro O. Poroshenko, he avoided insulting Mr. Putin, whose relations with Ukraine’s previous president were so poisonous the two leaders stopped talking. “There are a lot of questions we haven’t succeed to solve today, and it’s necessarily to be done in the future,” Mr. Zelensky said. “I am sure we will definitely do it, together.” Rather than annexing the breakaway territory in the east, Russia has made clear that its aim is to keep Ukraine firmly under its influence, not integrated with the West economically, militarily or politically. Mr. Putin’s government has indicated that Ukraine could regain at least nominal sovereignty over the region, and control of its eastern border with Russia. Moscow’s price for such a settlement includes Ukraine staying out of the European Union and NATO, and changing its Constitution to give more authority to regional governments — including those where pro-Russian forces are likely to govern. Such an agreement would be seen by many Ukrainians as a capitulation to Mr. Putin and an infringement on their country’s independence. Yet there is no approach that commands anything resembling majority support in Ukraine — not making the concessions Russia is seeking, not continuing the war, and not ceding control of the territory. But Mr. Zelensky made clear at the news conference that there could be no movement on the political and constitutional changes that Russia wants until security issues, including control of the border, had been settled. He also ruled out conceding to Russia’s previously insistent demand that Ukraine become a federation instead of a unitary state. This, he said, will never happen. The Minsk agreements mapped out steps to be taken by each side, including elections in rebel-held regions, the return to Ukrainian control of a now-porous border with Russia, greater autonomy for the separatist region, and the disarming of militant groups. But the plan left unclear their sequence, with Russia insisting that political steps come first, while Ukraine wants to begin with those involving security. Worried that Mr. Zelensky might succumb to Mr. Putin’s powers of persuasion, as Mr. Trump did in Helsinki in July last year, three opposition groups in Ukraine issued a manifesto ahead of the Paris meeting drawing six “red lines” that should not be crossed. They demanded that Mr. Zelensky make no concessions to Mr. Putin on Ukraine’s “Euro-Atlantic” foreign policy, the status of eastern regions and the timing of elections in territory occupied by Russian-backed separatists. Early Tuesday morning, protesters gathered near Mr. Zelensky’s office in the center of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, voicing relief that the Paris meeting had not ended in the “capitulation” they had feared. Mr. Zelensky’s predecessor, Mr. Poroshenko, had urged Mr. Zelensky to “avoid meeting one on one with Putin,” who he said could never be trusted. “Don’t trust Putin. Ever and in anything,” he said. “Putin manipulates everything: content, facts, figures, maps, emotions. He hates Ukraine and Ukrainians.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.']","The presidents of Ukraine and Russia met face-to-face for the first time, seeking to end the war in their border region.

North Korea Turns Up Pressure on the United States for Concessions,2019-12-08,By Choe Sang-Hun and David E. Sanger,"['SEOUL, South Korea — With North Korea’s deadline for American concessions fast approaching, the North announced Sunday that it had conducted a “very important test” at a missile-engine site, rapidly ramping up pressure after months of carefully calibrated provocations. Although President Trump has generally played down the North’s actions, on Sunday — just weeks before the Dec. 31 deadline — he issued a strong statement of his own, tweeting: “Kim Jong Un is too smart and has far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way.”  Analysts said North Korea had most likely conducted a ground-based test of a new type of engine for long-range ballistic missiles. But the North did not yet describe the test or release pictures of it, as it has in the past, so it is unclear whether it was a success.  Still, if an engine was tested, analysts say it could be a warning that Mr. Kim is considering returning to long-range missile tests. It was a series of such launches in 2017 that provoked a crisis with the United States as it became clear that the North’s longest-range missiles were capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States, and perhaps beyond.  Mr. Kim last year announced a halt to all tests of those intercontinental missiles and nuclear weapons, a self-imposed moratorium that Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited as one of the main achievements in his on-again, off-again diplomacy with Mr. Kim. Should they resume, it could mark a complete breakdown in what Mr. Trump had hoped would be his signature foreign policy achievement. The latest provocation comes after a series of short-range missile tests and statements by senior North Korean leaders that indicate Mr. Kim is running out of patience with diplomacy that has not won him the relief he craves from crippling sanctions. Those statements included a warning by a vice foreign minister that “it is entirely up to the U.S. what Christmas gift it will select to get.” North Korea has not been explicit about what might happen after Dec. 31, except that Mr. Kim has warned of finding a “new way” if Washington persists with sanctions and tries to force an unpalatable denuclearization deal. But senior North Korean officials have hinted that the new approach might include resuming nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. It has been obvious for months that the groundbreaking diplomacy between Mr. Kim and President Trump has stalled. Just hours before the test was announced Sunday, the North’s ambassador to the United Nations said that denuclearization was off the negotiating table — the key element of discussions between the two presidents over  the course of three meetings.  On Saturday, responding to the North Korean announcement that denuclearization was off the table, Mr. Trump emphasized his new relationship with Mr. Kim — seeming to suggest that would overcome the problems.  He kept repeating that he did not believe Mr. Kim wanted to “interfere” in the 2020 American elections, presumably a reference to how a return to missile launches and nuclear tests could create a confrontation just as Mr. Trump was running for re-election. By Sunday morning, Mr. Trump seemed to be hardening his tone with his Twitter message, which he put in a political context. “He does not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November.”  The president also claimed that Mr. Kim had committed himself to denuclearization when the two men first  met in Singapore, in June 2018. But that commitment called for working “toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,’’ wording that the North has used for decades to mean that it would dismantle its nuclear arsenal only if there was a complete pullback of American forces, including nuclear-capable ships, submarines and other weaponry.  The U.S. has never publicly discussed what it might be willing to give up, and has always suggested North Korean denuclearization must come first.  The mere announcement Sunday of the test was a sign the Singapore agreement was  unraveling. At a news conference in Singapore, Mr. Trump had said Mr. Kim had promised him he would dismantle the very site where the North conducted Saturday’s test. “Chairman Kim has told me that North Korea is already destroying a major missile engine testing site,” he said at the time. “That’s not in your signed document; we agreed to that after the agreement was signed. That’s a big thing — for the missiles that they were testing, the site is going to be destroyed very soon.” The test was carried out on Saturday at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground, also called the Tongchang-ri site near the North Korean border with China, a spokesman for the North’s Academy of National Defense Science said in a statement that was carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.  The brief statement provided no further details.  The site is also used to launch small satellites aboard North Korean rockets. But a rocket launch would have been instantly detected by American and other satellites. The academy reported “the results of the successful test of great significance” to the Central Committee of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party, the spokesman said. The spokesman said that the successful test “will have an important effect on changing the strategic position” of North Korea “once again in the near future.” While Mr. Trump falls back on his relationship with Mr. Kim — both their meetings and their exchange of what he has called “beautiful letters” — even top White House aides acknowledge that progress has been completely stalled. Subsequent meetings with Mr. Trump, in Hanoi and Korea, and continuing negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington have failed to resolve differences over how to implement the broadly worded Singapore deal.   Now Mr. Kim seems to be tiring of all the negotiating. In Hanoi early this year he offered to shutter the Yongbyon nuclear site, the country’s oldest and largest nuclear facility, in return for a lifting of the most onerous sanctions. But the Trump Administration has said that is insufficient because so much of his nuclear and missile capability is now outside the Yongbyon facility.   Mr. Kim, who has promised his long-suffering people economic recovery, is scheduled to convene his party’s Central Committee this month to “discuss and decide on crucial issues\u200b,” given “the changed situation at home and abroad\u200b,” according to the North Korean state media. In the meantime, analysts are searching for clues about the technical importance of Saturday’s test. Kim Dong-yub, a North Korea expert at the Seoul-based Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said it may have involved a new type of ICBM engine that uses solid fuel. North Korea’s existing ICBMs use liquid fuel. North Korea has been trying to convert its missiles from liquid fuel to solid, which is easier to transport. Solid fuel missiles are also faster to launch and easier to hide,\u200b thus making it harder for the United States military to find and target \u200bits missiles before they are launched. Although American intelligence agencies estimate North Korea has between 30 and 60 nuclear weapons, it remains unclear if the weapons — once loaded on a long-range missile — could withstand the heat and vibrations of re-entering the earth’s atmosphere.  “North Korea is avoiding violations of its long-range missile test moratorium for now, but it is still improving the propulsion and precision of its missiles so that it can claim a credible nuclear deterrent\u200b,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul\u200b. \u200b “The Kim regime knows that U.S. surveillance flights and satellites are watching. So with the activity at Sohae, Pyongyang is also trying to raise international concerns that it may intensify provocations and walk away from denuclearization talks next year. \u200b”  ']","The North said it conducted an “important test” at a missile-engine site ahead of a Dec. 31 deadline set by its leader, Kim Jong-un, for a new proposal from Washington on denuclearization."
"In Collecting Nobel Prize, Ethiopia’s Leader Plans to Sidestep Media",2019-12-09,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['[View the latest updates to the 2020 Nobel Prize winners list.] NAIROBI, Kenya — When the Norwegian Nobel Committee chose the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, for its peace prize this fall, it cited his efforts to free his country from years of political repression by releasing political prisoners, legalizing outlawed opposition groups and “discontinuing media censorship.” But when Mr. Abiy collects his prize in Oslo on Tuesday, he will not take questions from the news media, a move that breaks from tradition and has drawn criticism from the Nobel Committee.  Mr. Abiy won’t speak to reporters ahead of the awards ceremony or take questions after meeting with the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, Nobel officials said. He is also planning to skip an annual event where children perform for, and pose questions to, the peace prize laureate, hosted by Save the Children. Mr. Abiy’s minister of peace will attend on his behalf, the prime minister’s office said. A spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said that Mr. Abiy had more pressing priorities and that such events were not in keeping with “the humble disposition of the prime minister rooted in our cultural context.” But Mr. Abiy also has reasons to avoid scrutiny. Since winning the prestigious prize in October, he has faced criticism over his administration’s heavy-handed response to protests that grew after a prominent critic of Mr. Abiy accused the police of orchestrating an attack on him. On Monday, a United Nations report sounded an alarm over a proposed new hate speech law. David Kaye, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, issued the report after visiting Ethiopia, saying the bill could give government officials “unbounded discretion” to prosecute and arrest people. Mr. Abiy was awarded the peace prize for his initiative to resolve the decades-long border conflict with neighboring Eritrea, and for making significant political, economic, and social changes in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most-populous nation, since he came to power in mid-2018. Mr. Abiy, for example, named women to top governmental positions and engaged in efforts to bolster peace in nations including South Sudan, Somalia and Kenya. In awarding him the prize, the Nobel Committee said his actions gave “many citizens hope for a better life and a brighter future.” But the Nobel Committee has not hidden its disappointment with Mr. Abiy’s refusal to participate in its events. The committee’s chairman, Berit Reiss-Andersen, called it “regrettable” and “unfortunate,” according to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.  The director of the Nobel Institute, Olav Njolstad, traveled last week to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to try to change Mr. Abiy’s mind, but failed.  Mr. Abiy will give an acceptance speech and attend the Nobel banquet on Tuesday, as the guest of honor. The prize comes with about $1 million, a gold medal and a diploma.  Ms. Seyoum, Mr. Abiy’s press secretary, said of his decision to skip the media engagements, “It is quite challenging for a sitting head of state to dedicate that many days, particularly where domestic issues are pressing and warrant attention.”  The award comes during a fraught time for Ethiopia. Mr. Abiy faces a weak economy, regular outbreaks of deadly intercommunal violence and growing demands for statehood from numerous ethnic groups. He will be up for re-election next year. William Davison, senior Ethiopia analyst with the International Crisis Group, said that Mr. Abiy’s decision to avoid the news media in Oslo “may be due partly to the acute domestic challenges the prime minister is facing.” Even though Mr. Abiy “enjoys huge amounts of international good will that is not going to expire anytime soon,” Mr. Davison said, avoiding the media is “not a good look and should have been avoided.” Though his time as prime minister began with moves to ease media censorship, his administration has recently resorted to “old tactics,” including shutting down the internet and arresting journalists, said Muthoki Mumo, sub-Saharan Africa representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. Given these concerns, Mr. Abiy’s “refusal to answer media questions as he receives the Nobel Peace Prize reflects his government’s disregard for the role of the free press in keeping the public informed,” Ms. Mumo added. Simon Marks contributed reporting from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.']","Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is too busy and too humble for news conferences, his spokeswoman says, but observers say he’s avoiding scrutiny over trouble at home."
Trump Officials Block U.N. Meeting on Human Rights Abuses in North Korea,2019-12-09,By Edward Wong and Choe Sang-Hun,"['WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has refused to support a move by members of the United Nations Security Council to hold a discussion Tuesday on North Korea’s rampant human rights abuses, effectively blocking the meeting for the second year in a row. The American action appeared aimed at muting international criticism of Pyongyang’s human rights record in the hope of preserving a tenuous diplomatic opening between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the authoritarian leader of North Korea. Tensions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have broken out into the open in recent days. On Monday, North Korea called Mr. Trump a “heedless and erratic old man” after the American president warned that Mr. Kim could lose “everything” if he resumed military provocations like nuclear or long-range missile tests before the 2020 elections in the United States. A proposed meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday had been intended to put a spotlight on North Korea on Human Rights Day, which is held every Dec. 10 to mark the day in 1948 when the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Eight of the council’s 15 members had signed a letter to schedule the meeting but needed a ninth member — the minimum required. United Nations diplomats, confirming a report in Foreign Policy, said the United States had declined to sign. Asked on Monday about the administration’s blocking of the meeting, a State Department spokesman said any discussion of North Korea by the Security Council should cover recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, including missile launches by Pyongyang and a test at a satellite launch site. The council plans to discuss them on Wednesday. The absence of American support for a discussion of human rights in North Korea is a conspicuous change under the Trump administration. In 2014, after a United Nations commission released a report on widespread rights violations in North Korea, the Americans supported an annual meeting on the council devoted to the subject. The North Korean government was infuriated.  But last year, the Americans withdrew its support for such a meeting as Mr. Trump made diplomatic overtures to Mr. Kim, according to officials and diplomats, and no meeting was held. Mr. Trump’s critics say the action is consistent with what they regard as a transactional approach to foreign policy that diminishes concern for human rights. The president has embraced authoritarian leaders who oversee widespread abuses in their countries and rarely talks about rights violations. Mr. Trump has blocked sanctions on Chinese officials for running internment camps holding at least one million Muslims, for example, to try to reach a trade deal with China. “North Korea and other abusive governments that the United States is going easy on are undoubtedly elated that the days of U.S. criticism of their human rights records appear to be over for the time being,” said Louis Charbonneau, United Nations officer at Human Rights Watch.  Even with the derailment of the human rights meeting, the North Korean government has intensified its recent invective aimed at Mr. Trump. Kim Yong-chol, a hard-liner who speaks for the North Korean military, issued a statement criticizing Mr. Trump hours after the American leader warned on Twitter on Sunday that Kim Jong-un had “far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way.”  Mr. Trump also \u200bwarned that the North Korean leader should not “void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November” by resuming \u200bhostile acts. The messages came after North Korea announced on Sunday that it had carried out a “very important test” at its missile-engine test site. Analysts said the test probably involved a booster engine that could be used to propel a satellite-delivery rocket or an intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim Yong-chol, who is chairman of the North’s Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, said in response to the president’s comments that “Trump has too many things that he does not know about” North Korea, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. “We have nothing more to lose,” he said. The North Korean official also said\u200b that\u200b Mr. Trump’s latest Twitter messages showed that \u200bthe president was “an old man bereft of patience.” He accused Mr. Trump of \u200btrying to buy time before the Dec. 31 deadline set by Kim Jong-un for Washington to return to negotiations with concessions, including the lifting of sanctions. “As he is such a heedless and erratic old man, the time when we cannot but call him a ‘dotard’ again may come,” Kim Yong-chol said, referring to personal insults and threats of nuclear war that \u200bKim Jong-un and Mr. Trump exchanged two years ago. In 2017, amid escalating nuclear tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, Mr. Trump threatened to “totally destroy North Korea” if it threatened the United States, and called Kim Jong-un a “little rocket man” on a “suicide mission.” Mr. Kim retorted\u200b that Mr. Trump was “a mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” Relations between the American and North Korean leaders later warmed — but the new attack on Mr. Trump underscored the tensions. Kim Yong-chol visited Mr. Trump at the White House in June 2018 and again in January this year to deliver letters written to the president by Kim Jong-un. In the months after \u200bMr. Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit meeting in Singapore in June 2018 to discuss ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, \u200bthe American leader said he and the North Korean leader had fallen “in love.” Even as subsequent talks stalled, Mr. Trump continued to claim a “good relationship” with Mr. Kim.  But in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has also revived his old “rocket man” taunt. Last week, while urging North Korea to keep its promise to denuclearize, Mr. Trump warned that the United States would use military force if necessary. On Thursday, North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, said that Mr. Trump’s use of the “rocket man” insult was a sign of “the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.” On Saturday, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, issued a statement that suggested North Korea would no longer discuss denuclearization, Reuters reported. North Korean officials have warned that their government might end its self-imposed moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests if Washington does not meet Mr. Kim’s Dec. 31 deadline. A vice foreign minister of North Korea warned last week that it was up to Washington to decide what kind of “Christmas gift” it would receive from Pyongyang. On Monday, Kim Yong-chol, the North Korean official, warned that the United States should be ready to be “surprised.” Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, South Korea.

"‘I Have Told Everything,’ Says Whistle-Blower in China Crackdown",2019-12-07,"By Elian Peltier, Claire Moses and Edward Wong","['LONDON — A Uighur woman living in the Netherlands said on Saturday that she helped publicize secret Chinese government documents that shed light on how Beijing runs mass detention camps holding Muslim ethnic minorities.  She recounted how she lived in fear after she and her former husband received death threats and were contacted by Chinese security officers while journalists were preparing to report on the documents. Asiye Abdulaheb, 46, said in a telephone interview that she was involved in the release of 24 pages of documents published by Western news outlets last month, and was speaking out now to protect herself and her family from retaliation.  The documents, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and examined by journalists around the world, followed an earlier leak of 403 pages of internal papers to The New York Times that described how the authorities created, managed and justified the continuing crackdown on one million or more ethnic Uighurs and Kazakhs.  A Dutch newspaper, De Volkskrant, first reported on Ms. Abdulaheb’s role in the dissemination of that second set of documents, based on interviews with her and her ex-husband, Jasur Abibula. Both are Dutch citizens who have lived in the Netherlands since 2009, and they have a 6-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. Ms. Abdulaheb said in an hourlong interview in Mandarin Chinese with The Times that she had decided to speak out in the hopes that the publicity would dissuade the Chinese authorities from seeking to harm her or her family.  She said they already knew she had the documents, and she had told Dutch police officers about her situation. She added that the danger of her situation became evident after her husband returned from a trip to Dubai in mid-September during which Chinese security officers told him about the documents, interrogated him about Ms. Abdulaheb and tried to recruit him to spy on her. “I thought that this thing has to be made public,” she said. “The Chinese police would definitely find us. The people in Dubai had told my ex-husband, ‘We know about all your matters. We have a lot of people in the Netherlands.’” Ms. Abdulaheb said she had worked in government offices in Xinjiang, a vast northwestern region of China where the official crackdown on Muslims has taken place, but declined to go into detail.  In the interview Saturday, she confirmed that she received and helped leak the 24 pages, but she declined to explain who had sent her the documents. She said Chinese officers had told Mr. Abibula they wanted to find out who had passed her the material. The Times was part of the group coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, an independent nonprofit based in Washington, that reported on the second set of leaked documents on Xinjiang.  Ms. Abdulaheb said someone electronically sent her the 24 pages of internal Chinese documents in June.  “When I got the documents and looked at them, I concluded this was very important,” she said. “I thought the best thing to do was to put them out publicly.” After she posted a screenshot of one page of the documents on Twitter, hoping to draw attention, a German researcher on Xinjiang, Adrian Zenz, and another expert on the region reached out to her. They then put her in touch with a journalist, she said. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists later partnered with 17 other organizations, including The Times, to publish revelations on internment camps based on the 24-page set of documents.  That article came a week after The Times published a report based on 403 leaked pages that shed light on the origins and expansion of the crackdown in Xinjiang. The Times report said the source of its documents was a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity. In a statement Saturday, the consortium declined to say whether Ms. Abdulaheb was the source for its report. “ICIJ does not comment on its sources,” it said. It also reported that Mr. Zenz said Saturday that he did not give the documents to ICIJ. The two exposés sharpened international debate over the Chinese government’s intense crackdown across the region. Since 2017, the Chinese Communist Party has overseen a wave of mass detentions in Xinjiang, driving one million or more members of largely Muslim minority groups, especially Uighurs, into indoctrination camps intended to drastically weaken their Islamic beliefs and their attachment to the Uighur language, and make them loyal to the party. Initially, Chinese officials brushed away questions and reports about the detentions. But late last year, Beijing shifted its response: The Chinese authorities have since acknowledged the existence of the program, but defended the camps as job-training centers that teach the Mandarin Chinese language and practical skills, and that also warn people of the dangers of religious extremism.  In past decades, tensions between largely Muslim ethnic minorities and China’s Han ethnic majority in Xinjiang have occasionally erupted in violence. About half the region’s population is made up of minority groups, including 11.7 million Uighurs and 1.6 million Kazakhs. Both groups’ languages and cultures set them apart from Han people.  In 2009, the year Ms. Abdulaheb left China, ethnic rioting erupted in Urumqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang, and nearly 200 people were killed, most of them Han, according to government reports. China has cited that bloodshed and a succession of subsequent attacks on Han targets to defend its tough policies in Xinjiang. The leaks have challenged the official Chinese position by revealing the coercive underpinnings of the camps, and by hinting at dissent within the Chinese political system over the harsh policies in Xinjiang. Chinese government spokesmen and official media outlets have denounced the reports, calling them “fake news” and claiming they were part of a conspiracy to undermine stability in the region. In the Netherlands, Ms. Abdulaheb discovered that several of her social media accounts and a Hotmail account were hacked after she posted the tweet in June with the excerpt from the documents. She said she also got a message written in Uighur on Facebook Messenger that said, “If you don’t stop, you’ll end up cut into pieces in the black trash can in front of your doorway.” “That made me scared,” she said. Then in early September, an old friend of her ex-husband, someone who worked in a court in Xinjiang, contacted him after a long period of silence, Ms. Abdulaheb said. The friend invited Mr. Abibula to Dubai and offered to pay his expenses. He flew to Dubai on Sept. 9 and was met by his friend and several Chinese security officers who were ethnic Han, she said. After days of questioning Mr. Abibula, the officers handed him a USB stick and told him to put it into his ex-wife’s laptop, which would give them access to the computer’s contents, she said. Ms. Abdulaheb’s description of harassment and threats could not be independently verified. Still, her account fit a pattern that other Uighurs abroad have described. They have also recounted threats and pressure coming from China to remain silent or provide information to agents. Despite such threats, growing numbers of Uighurs and Kazakhs have spoken out, often using Twitter and Facebook to publicize family members in Xinjiang who have disappeared, possibly into re-education camps or prisons. A Uighur-American woman in the Washington area, Rushan Abbas, told The Times about family members who had gone missing after she had spoken publicly about the camps. In an interview Saturday, Mr. Zenz, the researcher, said that for Ms. Abdulaheb, “going public makes her safer” from potential retaliation. “So if something happens to her now, it will become a new story,” Mr. Zenz said. “Silence would have been so much worse.” Ms. Abdulaheb said she felt relieved to have revealed her identity.  “I have told everything,” she said. “My mind is calm now.” Elian Peltier and Claire Moses reported from London, and Edward Wong from Washington.']",Asiye Abdulaheb said she had helped spread documents exposing China’s detentions of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.
"French Strike Aims to Save an Envied, but Convoluted, Approach to Pensions",2019-12-07,By Liz Alderman,"['PARIS — Stéphane Vardon has worked as a conductor on France’s high-speed and suburban rail network for 20 years. It is hard work, he says, and he’d like to retire before he turns 58, a privilege he now fears President Emmanuel Macron is going to strip away. So this week, when nearly one million French citizens demonstrated nationwide to protect pension benefits that are the envy of much of the world, Mr. Vardon, 46, was among them, marching through the streets of Paris. “People will have to work longer and have less money for their retirement,” said Mr. Vardon, citing a common fear of Mr. Macron’s plans. “Macron isn’t close to the people. We know he won’t do anything for the workers.’’  While France’s official retirement age may be 62, the actual age varies widely across the country’s labyrinthine system. Train drivers can retire at 52, public electric and gas workers at 57, and members of the national ballet, who start dancing at a very young age, as early as age 42. That is to name just a few of the stark differences. It is this sheer complexity that Mr. Macron has vowed to untangle, aiming to standardize 42 different public and private pension schemes into one state-managed plan. At stake in the continuing standoff — much of France remained shutdown on Friday — is nothing less than the future of the country’s vaunted social safety net.  Elected in 2017, Mr. Macron has faced fierce strikes and street protests before as part of his attempts to add dynamism to France’s economy and make it more business friendly. But the pension overhaul is his biggest and most daunting test yet.  Unions are calling for another nationwide demonstration Tuesday, just before the government is scheduled to unveil fresh details of the pension overhaul. The transport strikes that incapacitated France this week have now been prolonged through early next week. As Mr. Macron moves to overhaul the pension system, it is precisely workers like Mr. Vardon — those with the most generous ‘‘special schemes’’ — that he would like to address. The country’s postwar retirement system was founded by Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who was intent on establishing a social safety net in 1946 following the liberation of France.  Amid the postwar tumult, he bowed to demands by France’s mainly Communist-led unions to let different professions control their pension plans.  Instead of a centralized system, railway workers oversaw their retirement system, as did sailors, lawyers, notaries, teachers and, eventually, even ballet dancers and actors. Because of the arduous nature of some professions, workers could retire early, a framework that persists today.  Mr. Macron has called the tangle outdated, unfair and unsustainable. France spends a whopping 14 percent of its gross domestic product on the pension system, more than almost any European country.  The system is staring at a potential deficit of 19 billion euros by 2025 if no action is taken, according to a landmark report issued by France’s pension czar, Jean-Paul Delevoye.  So Mr. Macron says he wants to merge the disparate systems, public and private, into one state-managed system by 2025.  He also wants to keep the deficit from growing, which Patrick Artus, chief economist of Paris-based Natixis bank, said could be achieved if every worker works at least another six months before retiring. Whether Mr. Macron can succeed in his plans is an open question. No French president has managed to achieve a radical overhaul of pensions. Mr. Macron says he isn’t seeking to reduce France’s pension spending — a point the government hopes will placate protesters.  Nonetheless, the changes he has proposed could alleviate the burden of some of the most generous pensions, which falls heavily on the government. To get there, Mr. Macron plans to pivot to a centrally managed points-based system similar to one used in Sweden, where workers accumulate points over the course of their careers and cash them in.  Mr. Macron says the system would be simpler and fairer, and would create better funding security for pensions as the population ages. Currently, the public pension fund is a pay as you go system that works like a group insurance, with workers and employers paying contributions from their income.  Pension benefits are currently calculated, in the private sector, based on a worker’s 25 highest earning years, and in the public sector on the last six months, when workers are likely to be at the height of their earning power.  Full pension benefits are earned after 41 to 43 years of contributions, depending on when workers were born, but workers can retire earlier, although those who do won’t get full benefits. All workers are also required to pay into supplementary pension schemes to complement public pensions, which pay retirees an average of around 75 percent of pretax earnings — among the most generous in Europe, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The state would remain the main guarantor of pensions, continuing to provide workers with a safety net that is unheard-of in the United States, where about half of Americans have no access to retirement savings plans, and have little or nothing saved for retirement. French unions say Mr. Macron’s plan is little more than smoke and mirrors and will benefit private-sector workers at the expense of teachers, railway workers, nurses, and other public-sector employees.  By valuing pensions on a lifetime of work, instead of the last six months, those in the public sector fear they will see their pensions slashed. Mr. Vardon, the conductor, is among those worried about taking a hit. His base salary of 1,800 euros a month is enough for a decent pension under the current scheme.  But under the points system, his retirement check calculation would include the lower salaries he earned when he started working 20 years ago, so he’ll get less. “It won’t be enough to have a retirement where I can live well,” he said. As things stand, Mr. Vardon would like to retire at age 57 and a half, the threshold permitted by the national railway scheme.  In reality, he said, he will probably need to work until age 62 to reap his full pension. Mr. Macron’s changes could force him to work even longer — a thought that fills him with dread. “We have difficult working conditions,” said Mr. Vardon, who assists passengers and manages work crews while maneuvering constantly on his feet as he crisscrosses the country at high speeds.  “We don’t eat at normal hours, we have short nights of sleep, which means that I am more tired and my body doesn’t have time to adapt,’’ he said. ‘‘I will age faster than someone who had a regular job Monday to Friday from nine to five.”  “Many of my colleagues died between the ages of 60 and 65,” he added, “So I’m worried I won’t make it.” Economists agree that the biggest winners are likely to be private-sector employees. Because pension payments under the point system would be indexed to France’s nominal gross domestic product, private-sector workers will have their pensions revalued and likely revised up, said Mr. Artus. “There will be winners and losers,” Mr. Artus said. While those losing out will face a painful transition, France’s overall pension system will be sounder in the long run, because a points system will make it easier to maintain balanced finances, he added. A recent poll by Elabe, a French polling agency, shows that over half of French people are concerned the current pensions system isn’t sustainable. Still, the political challenges to streamlining it remain enormous. The demonstrations are likely to go on as long as the French fear their pensions might suffer or they will have to work longer under any new system. French presidents have tended to back down from reform efforts in the past in the face of fierce public resistance. Mr. Vardon is among thousands who have vowed to continue the fight. While the demonstrations may look raucous to the outside world, “We want people to live without having to work longer to have a retirement,” he said. “Yes, we have a good system, but we think our system should be a model,” he added. “It allows people who have accidents, who are poor, who didn’t have any luck in life, to climb the social ladder and to continue — after a long career — to live, to feed themselves, to take a well deserved rest.”  “It’s a shame that other countries don’t have this,” he said.

"I.M.F., Endorsing Zelensky, Approves Loan for Ukraine",2019-12-08,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['KYIV, Ukraine — The International Monetary Fund has agreed to lend $5.5 billion to Ukraine, a move viewed as a stamp of approval for President Volodymyr Zelensky’s anticorruption and economic policies. An agreement with the fund, in Ukraine and elsewhere, is seen as important to wooing foreign investment. But for the Kyiv government, the deal brings another benefit in that it could help dispel talk of widespread Ukrainian corruption, which is an underlying issue in the impeachment proceedings in the United States Congress. “I commended the president for the impressive progress that he and his government have made in the past few months,” Kristalina Georgieva, the fund’s managing director, said in a statement announcing the agreement late Saturday. The agreement also comes at a critical time for the Kyiv government, two days before Mr. Zelensky is to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for peace talks in Paris.  Ukraine has turned to the fund to bail out its struggling economy, which has had a weak recovery after a deep recession in the wake of the country’s 2014 revolution and war with Russian-backed rebels. The European Union and United States have also propped up the pro-Western government in Kyiv. The United States has spent $3 billion on aid programs to Ukraine since 2014. But that aid was put in doubt over the summer when the Trump administration froze a portion, $391 million in security assistance, while asking Ukraine’s government to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family and spreading unfounded accusations that Ukraine, not Russia, had hacked the 2016 election in the United States. In the impeachment hearings, allies of President Trump said he had been justified in delaying the aid over worries about corruption but that the concerns were allayed by mid-September, after Mr. Zelensky had been in office for several months. The military assistance was released on Sept. 11. The fund’s statement praised Mr. Zelensky but also noted obliquely that releasing the aid would hinge on the president’s breaking with an oligarch and former business partner, Ihor Kolomoisky. Ties between the men have been seen as an impediment to reform. But the I.M.F. and the Ukrainian government had seemed to be talking past each other about what needed to be done. Mr. Zelensky said his government would not reverse the nationalization of Mr. Kolomoisky’s bank, Privat, a move that would cost the budget billions. The fund sought assurances that the government would recover money that banking regulators say Mr. Kolomoisky stole before the nationalization. He denies wrongdoing. In her statement, Ms. Georgieva suggested that in a phone call Mr. Zelensky had agreed to try to recover funds. The two agreed, she said, that “it is paramount to safeguard the gains made in cleaning up the banking system and recover the large costs to the taxpayers from bank resolutions.” The fund said the agreement was still awaiting board approval and that the money would not be released until the Kyiv government completes so-called prior actions, which are more stringent and hold more specific fund requirements than general benchmarks such as keeping a deficit within bounds.']","The International Monetary Fund, in conditionally agreeing to lend the country $5.5 billion over three years, cited “impressive progress” under President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"At Japan’s Most Elite University, Just 1 in 5 Students Is a Woman",2019-12-08,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — From a young age, Satomi Hayashi studied hard and excelled academically. It seemed only natural that she would follow in her father’s footsteps and attend the University of Tokyo, Japan’s most prestigious institution. As soon as she was admitted, her friends warned that she was spoiling her marriage prospects. Men, they said, would be intimidated by a diploma from Todai, as the university is known in Japan. Spooked, she searched Google for “Can Todai women get married?” and discovered it was a well-trod stereotype. The admonitions didn’t stop her. But Ms. Hayashi, 21, wondered if other women were scared off. When she arrived three years ago, fewer than one in five undergraduates at the university were women. The dearth of women at Todai is a byproduct of deep-seated gender inequality in Japan, where women are still not expected to achieve as much as men and sometimes hold themselves back from educational opportunities. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promoted an agenda of female empowerment, boasting that Japan’s labor force participation rate among women outranks even the United States. Yet few women make it to the executive suite or the highest levels of government. The disconnect starts at school. Although women make up nearly half the nation’s undergraduate population, the oldest and most elite universities reflect — and magnify — a lackluster record in elevating women to the most powerful reaches of society. For nearly two decades, enrollment of women at the University of Tokyo has hovered around 20 percent, an imparity that extends across many top colleges. Among seven publicly funded national institutions, women make up just over one quarter of undergraduates. At the exclusive private universities Keio and Waseda, women are a little over a third. They lag other selective institutions across Asia. Women are close to half of the student body at Peking University in China, 40 percent of Seoul National in South Korea and 51 percent of the National University of Singapore. At Todai, “you can see right away there is something completely out of balance,” said Ms. Hayashi, a literature major. “Because women are half of society, there is something strange about a university that is only 20 percent women.” In status-conscious Japan, a diploma from Todai is the ultimate pedigree — the equivalent of Harvard, Stanford and M.I.T. all rolled into one. It opens doors in politics, business, law and science. More prime ministers have graduated from Todai than any other universities, while more than half of the country’s Supreme Court justices are alumni. The university boasts the highest number of graduates to go on to Parliament or win Nobel Prizes. “We have the most powerful education that we can dangle” in front of anyone, said Nobuko Kobayashi, a 1996 Todai graduate and a partner at EY Japan, where less than 10 percent of partners are women. “We were branded with it,” she said. “We almost bask in its glory unconsciously.” Speaking this year to freshmen at Todai, Chizuko Ueno, a retired professor of gender studies, suggested the imbalance was a symptom of inequality that extended beyond higher education. “Even before students enter the university, there is already hidden sexism,” Ms. Ueno said. “Unfortunately,” she added, “the University of Tokyo is an example of this.” Her sentiments touched a nerve in the audience. On Twitter, male students complained of being harangued. “Why is she not celebrating us, the male students?” one wrote. Another called it “feminist propaganda.” In the speech, Ms. Ueno referred to a scandal exposing deliberate discrimination  at Tokyo Medical University, where officials acknowledged suppressing the entrance-exam scores of female applicants for years. Administrators wanted to limit the proportion of women to 30 percent, claiming that female doctors were likely to stop working after getting married or giving birth. A year after the scandal was revealed, women passed at a higher rate than men. There is no evidence that the University of Tokyo manipulates exam results. Rather, officials say, women’s admissions are consistent with the applicant pool. “We are just like stores that don’t have enough customers,” said Akiko Kumada, one of the few female engineering professors at Todai and a member of its gender equality committee. “Right now,” she said, “we are not getting enough female customers.” Ms. Kumada has a few theories. Young girls, she said, are repeatedly fed the idea that academic achievement is not feminine. She cited lyrics by AKB48, a female pop band, like “While I’m still in school/It’s O.K. to be stupid.” Some women, she said, might fear that a Todai degree inevitably leads to a high-powered career in a brutal working culture. One graduate committed suicide after telling friends she had endured harassment and grueling hours at an advertising agency. To recruit women, the university has mostly tried small-bore measures. Todai sends female students back to their high schools to encourage younger women to take the entrance exam. In a recruitment brochure, “we try to balance the photos we run,” said Ms. Kumada, “and make sure we have women in them.”  A more substantial policy provides dormitory subsidies to women from outside Greater Tokyo, an effort to mollify parents who might worry about safety in the big city. The university pays 30,000 yen a month — roughly $275 — for about 100 female students. Critics have attacked the policy as discriminatory against men. Outright quotas for women have been a nonstarter: Todai administrators reject affirmative action as inequitable. “Do we really want to create a special quota for female students whose academic achievement may be much lower?” Ms. Kumada said. Staunchly traditional, Todai draws from the same high schools year after year. More than a quarter of students who enrolled in 2019 came from just 10 high schools, seven of which are all male. Unconsciously or not, high school and college administrators say, parents are more likely to push sons to achieve. “With sons, parents really expect a lot and want their boys to perform to the maximum level and aim as high as they can go,” said Hiroshi Ono, principal of Tokyo Gakugei University High School, which sent 45 students to Todai this year, 11 of them women. Parents, Mr. Ono said, “feel bad about pushing girls to work that hard — they think it would be better for them to get married and be a housewife.” Even at Oin Girls School, which sends more women to Todai than any other high school, administrators said girls may feel ambivalent about pursuing an elite education. “A woman’s life is much more complicated,” said Yukiko Saito, Oin’s principal. “They have to decide who to marry, whether to marry, whether to have children or not.” For a vast majority of students, admission to Todai rests solely on one exam for which students spend years studying. High school grades and extracurriculars carry no weight. Zkai, a cram school for university entrance exams, has a high acceptance rate to Todai. Wataru Miyahara, a director, said fewer girls study for the exam. “It’s hard to tell which is the chicken and which is the egg,” he said. “But there are so few girls at Todai, so it’s hard for girls to look at Todai and say, ‘I want to go there.’” Whatever the reason, he said, “They are not as ambitious as boys.” Three years ago, Todai invited high schools to recommend one male and one female student who could forgo the exam in exchange for an essay or group interview. Fewer than 70 students a year are admitted this way, out of a freshman class of more than 3,000. Aine Adachi, 21, who came to Todai three years ago through this system, said expanding the criteria to evaluate strengths not captured by one high-stakes test could bring more women into the university. “Having one criteria to judge a person by doesn’t make it fair,” she said. On campus, Ms. Adachi, who is studying law, said she feels scrutinized as a minority. Gender discrimination, she said, comes in subtle forms. Once she and a male classmate were planning a club trip, huddled over laptops in a cafe near campus. Another male classmate walked up and observed their conversation. “It looks like the boss and his secretary!” he quipped. “Why do you assume I’m the secretary?” Ms. Adachi retorted. “Why can’t I be the boss?” Women at Todai often feel isolated. When a class gathered for a graduation photo, Kiri Sugimoto, 24, a law student, was the only woman. “What irritated me was that the men made remarks like having me in the picture would look great because it wouldn’t look like a boys prep school photo,” she said. “I was treated as the decorative rose among stones. That irritated me to be treated like that.” Male students don’t necessarily regard the campus demography as a problem. Hiroaki Kitamura, 19, an engineering major, said he didn’t think men would act differently with more women in class. “It’s not like we have sexual conversations just because there are so few women,” he said. Although, he added, classes might be “more fashionable” if more women enrolled. Some Todai men avoid socializing with female classmates, favoring activities where most of the women come from other universities. At a Todai ballroom-dancing club, Erica Nakayama, 24, a masters student, said she and her classmates were outnumbered by women from other universities. Todai men, she said, frequently typecast female peers as too serious. “They said we weren’t cute enough,” she said. “A boy once said, ‘Todai girls are a little scary,’” Ms. Nakayama recalled. “I just kind of laughed and let it go. But in a way it did kind of hurt my feelings.” Some clubs tacitly bar Todai women, although the university officially discourages outright exclusion. Of more than 30 social clubs focused on tennis, for example, only two actively recruit Todai women. Masato Sagisaka, a 21-year-old sophomore, said a friend told him intercollegiate groups were “more fun.” He joined a tennis club that has a longstanding partnership with a Catholic women’s college. No Todai women have joined. Inviting female classmates, he said, might upset the group’s harmony. “Todai women really don’t get along with women from other universities,” he said. “Todai women have pride.” Men have little incentive to change. Campus advocacy is minimal. Even an investigation by the student newspaper about clubs that exclude Todai women did not identify the exclusive groups. Women hesitate to speak out. Ms. Nakayama said she avoided activism that might be construed as feminist. “It might have some repercussions for me,” she said. People “might think I’m acting too manly or too strong.” In and outside class, Ms. Hayashi said, women tolerate a culture in which men make jokes filled with sexual innuendo or comment on women’s appearances. “You are expected to understand or communicate with these sexual jokes,” she said. “Otherwise you feel kind of left out.” “You just have to understand,” she said, “and accept the male view.”']",
‘There Were No Safety Features’: Outrage Follows New Delhi Fire,2019-12-09,By Kai Schultz and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — The phone calls started before dawn, frantic young men dialing relatives in faraway villages. As a fire engulfed the building where they worked and slept in New Delhi, blocking exits and filling rooms with smoke, the trapped men bid loved ones goodbye through sobs. “There is no escape route, no option at all,” one of the men, Muhammad Musharraf, told a friend on the phone, as others screamed in the background. “I can’t even breathe.” The blaze that killed at least 43 people and injured dozens more early Sunday in New Delhi was one of the worst on record in the country, and it highlighted chronic problems with slipshod city planning and lax enforcement of fire regulations in the Indian capital. The four-story residential building was one of several thousand in northern Delhi that had been illegally converted into a factory. Officials said the five or so businesses operating inside were unlicensed.  The building, in the neighborhood of Anaj Mandi, had no fire safety certification or emergency escape route. Windows were blocked with metal grills, flammable objects covered staircases and one of the building’s two exits was locked when the fire broke out, according to Atul Garg, the chief fire officer in New Delhi.  Many workers slept 10 to 15 in tiny, dimly lit rooms, where they spent their days making paper products, backpacks, plastic toys and clothing. Most were young Muslim men, some of them teenagers, who had come from distant villages in search of jobs that paid just a few dollars a day. “There were no safety features,” Mr. Garg said. The building’s owner, whom officials identified simply as Rehan, had also built at least one additional floor that did not meet minimum safety standards. He has been arrested and charged with crimes of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and “negligent conduct.” Varsha Joshi, a commissioner for the local municipal corporation, told reporters that officials tried to inspect the building last week, as part of a bigger project closing illegal manufacturing units, but that some of the floors had been locked.  According to city data, at least 2,800 businesses have been found to work from residential buildings without proper paperwork in northern Delhi, though officials said the true figure could easily surpass 10,000. Fires occur regularly in India’s cramped urban centers. New Delhi and its suburbs, a metropolis of more than 46 million, is full of dilapidated apartments squished into cubbyhole alleys.  Many businesses opt to rent floors in these buildings rather than spend more on factories in industrial areas. Even there, disaster often strikes. Last year, a blaze at a fireworks factory on the outskirts of New Delhi killed at least 17 people. The fire on Sunday started on the building’s second or third floor around 5 a.m., possibly from a short circuit.  Thirty minutes later, dozens of firefighters were at the scene, but they struggled to reach the entrance: A small lane leading to the building could not accommodate more than one truck, and the path was further blocked by parked motorcycles. As smoke billowed from the building, workers trapped inside screamed for help through the window grills. Firefighters broke down doors and carried unconscious men on their backs.  The streets, clogged with hundreds of people and convoys carrying politicians, became so chaotic that some victims were transported to hospitals in auto rickshaws. It took firefighters several hours to douse the flames. “If there was an unlocked exit on the top floor, many more people might have been saved,” said Mohammad Irfan, a resident who lives at the end of the alley. On Monday, relatives wound through the halls of Lok Nayak Hospital to identify the dead and tend to the injured. Among them was Alauddin Nadab, who rushed between the burn unit, where his brother was being treated, and the hospital’s mortuary, where the bodies of two cousins were stored. Early Sunday, a relative from the state of Bihar called Mr. Nadab, who also lives in Anaj Mandi, telling him that his brother and cousins were trapped in the building, where they each earned about $7 a day making hats and leather products. When Mr. Nadab reached the hospital, doctors told him that his cousins had already died and that his 22-year-old brother had little chance of surviving. Sixty percent of his body was covered in burns. “This is the life of poor men in this country,” Mr. Nadab said.

"Hong Kong Protest, Largest in Weeks, Stretches Several Miles",2019-12-08,"By Javier C. Hernández, Elaine Yu and Lam Yik Fei","['HONG KONG — Hundreds of thousands of protesters, basking in a recent election victory by Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp, poured onto the city’s streets on Sunday in one of the largest marches in weeks to pressure the government to meet demands for greater civil liberties. The huge turnout was a reminder to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, that the monthslong campaign against his authoritarian policies still had broad support in Hong Kong despite a weakening economy and increasingly violent clashes between protesters and the police. Tensions in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, had eased somewhat in recent days, after pro-democracy advocates won a stunning victory in local elections two weeks ago, giving new hope to the movement. On Sunday, demonstrators returned in force, packing city streets to denounce Mr. Xi’s government, rail against police brutality and reiterate demands for greater civil liberties, including universal suffrage. They beat drums, sang protest anthems and chanted, “Fight for freedom.” Though the march was largely peaceful, some demonstrators vandalized shops and restaurants and lit a fire outside the high court. “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong,” said Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher who stood among protesters gathered at Victoria Park. “We don’t want to become like China.” As many as 800,000 people attended the march, according to Civil Human Rights Front, an advocacy group that organized the gathering. The mood at the march was relaxed, with people taking selfies against a backdrop of the vast crowds. Children, some dressed in black, marched with their parents, holding hands as they shouted, “Stand with Hong Kong!”  A sea of protesters, spread across several miles, filled major thoroughfares as they moved between towering skyscrapers. In some areas, there were so many people that the crowds moved at a snail’s pace and spilled into adjacent alleys. Some small businesses encouraged the turnout by promising giveaways if more than one million people joined the march.  The protesters said they intended to remain peaceful on Sunday, but some vowed to use more aggressive tactics if the police cracked down. In the evening, the police readied canisters of tear gas as they stood opposite crowds of protesters who had barricaded a street downtown in a briefly tense moment.  The large turnout could further embolden the movement’s confrontational front-line protesters, who said they planned to disrupt the city’s roads and public transportation system on Monday. The call for further action seemed to resonate among some protesters on Sunday. “If the government still refuses to acknowledge our demands after today, we should and will escalate our protests,” said Tamara Wong, 33, an office worker who wore a black mask as she stood among the crowd gathered at Victoria Park.  The protesters have demanded amnesty for activists who were arrested and accused of rioting, as well as an independent investigation of police conduct during the demonstrations.  Despite the show of strength on Sunday, it is unlikely that the protesters will win further concessions from Beijing, which has worked to portray demonstrators as rioters colluding with foreign governments to topple the governing Communist Party.  Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University, said that even though Sunday’s march showed the protest movement remained strong and unified, Beijing was unlikely to listen to its demands. “Hong Kong is condemned to live in a permanent political crisis as long as China is ruled by the Communist Party,” Professor Cabestan said. Mr. Xi, who has cultivated an image as a hard-line leader, has demanded “unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities” in Hong Kong. He has publicly endorsed the city’s beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam, and her efforts to bring an end to the unrest. Chinese officials have suggested that the United States is responsible for helping fuel unrest in Hong Kong, pointing to statements by American officials in support of the protests. Last month, President Trump signed tough legislation that authorizes sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for rights abuses in Hong Kong. The move was welcomed by many protesters but also seen as exacerbating tensions between the two countries. In a possible sign of increased scrutiny of American citizens working in Hong Kong, two leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said on Saturday that they had been denied entry to Macau, a semiautonomous Chinese city. Mr. Xi is expected to visit Macau this month to mark the 20th anniversary of the former Portuguese colony’s return to China. Tara Joseph and Robert Grieves, the president and the chairman of the American business group, said they had planned to attend an annual ball put on by the chamber’s Macau branch. “We hope that this is just an overreaction to current events and that international business can constructively forge ahead,” Ms. Joseph said.  The protests, which began in June in opposition to a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, have hurt the tourism and retail sectors, pushing the city’s economy into recession.  In recent weeks, the violence has escalated, with protesters intensifying their efforts to vandalize businesses they associate with hostility to the movement. The police shot an antigovernment protester last month, inflaming tensions. Then, in some of the worst violence, universities became battlefields, with black-clad students hurling gasoline bombs, throwing bricks and aiming arrows at the riot police, who shot rubber bullets and fired tear gas in return. Many demonstrators acknowledge that a compromise with the government is unlikely, despite recent victories. Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, who is under pressure from Beijing to restore order without weakening the government’s position, has brushed aside their demands and has warned that the mayhem could “take Hong Kong to the road of ruin.” Government officials have cast the demonstrations as primarily centered on economic issues, arguing that vast inequality in Hong Kong has exacerbated anger among the city’s youth. They rolled out emergency measures recently to counter the effects of the turmoil on the economy, including providing electricity subsidies to businesses and expanding job training for young people. The authorities have justified their efforts to crack down on the movement by saying that protesters are endangering public safety. On Sunday, the police said they had found a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, five magazines, 105 bullets and two ballistic vests, as well as fireworks, among other items, during a series of early morning raids. Senior Superintendent Steve Li of the Hong Kong Police said early in the day that officers had received information that the firearm and fireworks would have been used on Sunday to create chaos.  The police have in recent months banned many protests and rallies in Hong Kong, citing safety concerns. But the government granted a rare approval for the march on Sunday, which was held to mark the United Nations’ Human Rights Day. Demonstrators said they believed that the turnout sent a strong message: The protest movement would not back down. “If the government thinks that we will give up,” said Adam Wong, 23, a university student who was waving a black flag, “today’s turnout will prove them delusional.” Katherine Li and Ezra Cheung contributed reporting.']",Throngs of people poured into major thoroughfares for a march marking Human Rights Day.
"With France in Uproar Over Pensions, Macron May Need One Early",2019-12-09,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — With his country in turmoil, more chaos looming and no resolution in sight, President Emmanuel Macron of France tried changing the subject. Last Thursday, nearly a million people had taken to the streets to protest his plan to remake France’s uniquely generous pension system. But a day later, Mr. Macron, instead of addressing what was on everyone’s minds — how to get out of the standoff, which has stranded thousands of commuters — delivered a lyrical tribute far from Paris to three rescue workers killed in a helicopter crash. That Olympian silence on the immediate issue of the day encapsulated Mr. Macron’s challenge as a reformer, past, present and future, in the view of some analysts. The French president sold himself to voters as a nonpolitician, but that credential has come back to haunt him. His own party criticizes what many call his maladroit communication on an anxiety-inducing subject. Now, some within the party are predicting a rough road ahead for the man who promised his country a “revolution” in a campaign manifesto of that name. His citizens turned out to have a revolution of their own in mind — one that, like so many in France’s past, is bubbling up from the streets. More strikes and demonstrations were planned for Tuesday, after the government met through the weekend to refine the details of the pension-streamlining plan. On Monday, commuters woke to more chaos, with 14 out of 16 metro lines shut down in Paris, most trains across the country canceled and traffic backed up for miles around Paris. The unions are preparing for a long fight. Mr. Macron may now may be running out of space and time to deliver his own cerebral version of the revolution. “The reform possibility of this government is weakened,” said Gérard Grunberg, a veteran political scientist at Sciences Po, the international research university. Mr. Macron has tried to nudge France toward a closer embrace of market forces — loosening up rules for hiring and firing, for example — and has reduced the unemployment rate from over 9 percent to around 8 percent. But this has not widened his circle of support: barely a third of the French approve of him. And his latest initiative may further erode his popularity. “He seems absolutely incapable of expanding his political and social base,” said Mr. Grunberg. “He’s only supported by the little quarter who support what he represents ideologically. I don’t see him regaining popularity. It’s a big weakness.” Mr. Macron insists that the new pension plan, which aims to simplify the country’s current 42 systems into one points-based system, will be fairer. “It’s to unite, in a single system,” Mr. Macron said at a town-hall meeting in October. “And whatever your field of work, each point you save, that you ‘buy,’ it will give you exactly the same rights when you reach retirement.”  On Wednesday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will present what is supposed to be the plan’s final draft. Apart from the huge cost, there is little doubt the current system works well for many. In France the poverty rate among those older than 65 is less than 5 percent, largely because of the pension system, while in the United States it approaches 20 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In France, life expectancy is increasing, while in the United States it is diminishing in significant sectors of the population. With public opinion behind the strikers, and the unions emboldened by their success, the margin for maneuvering by the government appears limited. Fifty-three percent backed the strikers in a poll published Sunday in Le Journal du Dimanche. Mr. Macron’s political learning on the job has not helped. Even some of his own supporters are starting to get anxious. “We absolutely must remove the uncertainties for the French, that this reform won’t have a negative impact on their pensions,” said Benoît Simian, a member of Parliament from Mr. Macron’s party who represents an area around Bordeaux. The standoff, he said, “hurts the reformist capacity of the government, which is a necessity for our future. Clearly, this could put a wrench in our ability to reform.”  The lack of clarity over who, if anybody, will win and lose in the new pension system has opened a door for Mr. Macron’s hitherto weak political opposition and for the unions. Some analysts say private-sector workers will come out ahead. That prediction has enraged the public sector. “They decided, all by themselves, to create a revolution in the pensions system,” the leftist opposition leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon told journalists in Marseille last week. “It’s a real provocation to our welfare state.” At a union demonstration this weekend in Paris against the pension changes, protesters made clear who their target was. “Stop Macron and his government and their reactionary program!” an organizer yelled through a microphone on a chilly plaza in front of the Montparnasse railway station, normally busy but now virtually emptied. “This movement goes way beyond just pensions,” said Fabrice Angei, an official with the leftist CGT union, shouting above the union anthems blaring from the loudspeakers. “Mr. Macron is the representative of the free-marketers, of Thatcher, and that is being contested all over the world,” Mr. Angei said. “And he is an anachronism in relation to this revolt against inequality and the authoritarian state.”   Olivier Thily, a railway worker at the demonstration, said: “We’re hoping that they will back down. Anyway, this is only the beginning.” The pension standoff may have highlighted Mr. Macron’s vulnerabilities as a reformer, but it has also shown his determination to proceed regardless of warnings from history. Nearly 25 years ago, the government of one of his mentors, Alain Juppé, was fatally weakened by a similar effort to streamline the pension systems. After a general transport strike lasting nearly a month, Mr. Juppé — often accused of the same kind of high-minded imperiousness as Mr. Macron — was forced to back down. A year-and-a-half later Mr. Juppé’s government collapsed. Mr. Macron already faced a near-death experience for his government because of protests last year by the Yellow Vest movement. They were tamed with a massive infusion of cash, fierce police repression and days of presidential palaver. “What we’re seeing is that, with considerable courage, Macron is attacking, like no one before, the systematic reform of the pensions system,” said Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist. He said, “Every time anybody has tried to do this, there’s been huge social mobilization, because the whole subject is so anxiety-provoking.” Mr. Macron’s advisers say he understands the risks. “He’s not losing his cool, and he’s totally prepared,” said Ismaël Emelien, a longtime aide to Mr. Macron who is now in the private sector but still counsels the president.  “He knows that this reform is complicated, and that reforming pensions is the hardest one of all,” Mr. Emelien said. “It revives lots of bad memories for the French.”  Public opinion appears to be on the other side. “I completely support the cause,” said Anais de Matos, a freelance videographer, who said the strike “doesn’t bother me at all — I think it’s great.” “We can’t go back,” Ms. de Matos said. “It isn’t that we need to take some privileges from some people, but that we need to extend those privileges to others.” Melissa Godin contributed reporting.']",A standoff over the president’s plan to simplify a generous retirement system raises doubts about his ability to change France. 
Protesters Killed and Cleric’s House Bombed in Deepening Iraqi Chaos,2019-12-07,By Falih Hassan and Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — Unknown assailants killed a dozen unarmed anti-government protesters in the Iraqi capital in an attack the president blamed on criminal gangs, and an unmanned drone bombed the home of a prominent Shiite cleric who has been a major supporter of the protest movement.  The bombing of the cleric Moktada al-Sadr’s home in the southern city of Najaf came a few hours after the overnight attack on the protesters, who were in a building where many supporters of Mr. al-Sadr have been gathering to stage demonstrations demanding a change in the system of government, the elimination of corruption and a curbing of Iran’s influence on the country. No one was injured in the Najaf bombing on Mr. al-Sadr’s home. Lethal assaults on protesters by unknown gunmen have been rare since the protests began more than two months ago. And the back-to-back attacks raised tensions between the Iraqi security forces and the protesters.  “The people of Iraq are at a boiling point,” said Sa’ad Maye al-Hilfi, a member of Parliament’s Defense and Security Committee, which planned to hold an emergency meeting on Sunday.  No one claimed responsibility for the violence, and with the country’s security forces pulled in different directions, it was not clear who, if anyone, could have ordered it. President Barham Salih has been acting temporarily as the head of state since the prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, resigned last month, and Parliament has yet to name a replacement. The prime minister is the commander in chief, and in the absence of his leadership, it is unclear who exactly is in charge or determining the security forces’ priorities.   Some of the forces are under the command of the Defense Ministry, others are under the command of the Interior Ministry, while others are controlled by the Popular Mobilization Forces, which technically report to the joint operations command.  Some of the Popular Mobilization Forces have close links to Iran and are among the 30 armed groups that are now being integrated into the security structure. But a few heavily armed groups close to Iran have remained outside that integration process.  Complicating the security landscape further, there are two or three armed extremist groups that oppose the government, as the protesters do. But these groups seem bent on disrupting the peaceful protests with armed attacks.  Their presence makes it possible for rogue elements within the various government security forces to operate with impunity and blame extremist groups for their activities.  President Salih said the shooting of the protesters was “a criminal, armed attack carried out by criminal and outlaw gangs.” He admonished the security forces, saying their responsibility was not only to protect “the peaceful demonstrators and public and private property” but also to “chase the outlaw criminals and arrest them and bring them to the judiciary for punishment.”  The protesters were shot near the Sinak Bridge, which spans the Tigris River — one of three bridges that have been taken over by protesters. In addition to the deaths, about 100 people were wounded in the shootings.  The assault started in a six-story parking garage that overlooks the bridge and the Tigris River. The garage is one of two buildings that have become protester strongholds.  “What happened was that at 8 p.m. yesterday, we were surprised when we heard a fight happen on the fourth floor and then suddenly there was shooting,” said Murtada Saad, 18, a tuk tuk driver who works around the bridge and had driven his three-wheeled vehicle into the building.  Soon after, there was shooting outside, as well as in a nearby square which the protesters have also occupied. Witnesses described a chaotic situation in which they said some gunmen appeared to be wearing the military uniforms of government forces. Some were wearing uniforms of the Popular Mobilization Forces and some were in civilian clothes.  The protesters called on the Iraqi military to intervene. But some soldiers were attacked when they arrived, adding to the confusion and forcing them to retreat.  Witnesses said at least some of the attackers, maybe all of them, sped away in white pickup trucks. Video footage showed at least seven vehicles. The sound of continuous shooting can be heard in the video as the trucks leave.  Over the past several weeks, followers of Mr. al-Sadr have occupied the parking garage near the Sinak Bridge. Mr. Saad, the tuk tuk driver, said Saturday that a couple of days ago, some people had come to the building saying they were from the south of Iraq and had set up tents on the fourth floor.  “None of our guys searched the two tents because, unfortunately, some of our guys take bribes and anyone can bring anything into the building,” he said. “So they brought weapons into the building.”  Mr. Saad continued: “In the beginning, we were attacked from inside the building by the infiltrators, and then we were surprised by heavy shooting and many vehicles. There was a literal massacre.” The Popular Mobilization Commission told its followers to obey the directives of the Iraqi defense forces and to stay away from the centers of protest.   Mr. al-Sadr told his followers on Twitter to go home for now or to stay in the heavily populated protest squares.  Some of the protesters who had manned the Sinak Bridge were there on Saturday to mourn their lost friends.  Karar Jabar, 25, said he had gotten to know Mustafa Kamal, 21, over the last month of protest. They visited each other — at their posts on different bridges.  “We were surprised by the heavy fire around 8 last night. I tried to speak to them, but they were completely evil killers,” Mr. Jabar said.  “My friend Mustafa, whom I came to see here at Sinak, got killed by sniper fire,” he said as he bent to light votive candles he had placed on the concrete around the dried blood where his friend had fallen. “They treated us brutally as if we are their enemies.”']",It remained unclear who killed a dozen protesters and bombed the home of the antigovernment cleric Moktada al-Sadr.
France’s Weekend of Discontent: Yellow Vest and Pension Protesters Gather,2019-12-07,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — One protest movement started a year ago in France and drew hundreds of thousands at its peak to roundabouts across the country in angry “Yellow Vest” demonstrations against planned increases in gas taxes.  Another — a nationwide strike expressing fury over President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul the pension system — began this past week. On Saturday, it continued to paralyze parts of the country. Even as the strength of the long-running Yellow Vest protests has dissipated over the year, the movement’s simmering anger at the president has run smack dab this weekend into the latest turmoil over his pension plans. Both events have harnessed broader discontent with the policies of Mr. Macron, who is viewed both by both Yellow Vests and labor activists as arrogant and disconnected from their daily struggles. At their most violent, the Yellow Vest protests saw people break shop windows, the police fire tear gas and rubber bullets and Mr. Macron consider a state of emergency. More Yellow Vest rallies were expected in Paris and other cities on Saturday, and so were traditional union demonstrations against unemployment. But the size and impact of both are uncertain. And though neither is directly tied to the pension demonstrations, both could get a boost from the latest social unrest.  On Saturday, about a thousand Yellow Vest protesters marched from the Economy Ministry to southern Paris. The demonstration was mostly calm, despite brief scuffles with the police, who fired tear gas. A separate union protest gathered in the Montparnasse neighborhood, while labor activists also demonstrated in cities like Marseille and Caen. There is little sign of any coordination among any of those causes: The Yellow Vests — named for the fluorescent emergency gear that all French drivers must have in their vehicles — are largely leaderless and the union rallies are held annually on the first Saturday of December.  But the pension fight has given new energy to both movements, and some Yellow Vests took part in this past week’s labor marches, a stark contrast to last year, when they rejected unions as inefficient and archaic. And the government was gearing up for more protests in the coming week. Labor unions have called for huge street demonstrations on Tuesday, the day before Prime Minister Édouard Philippe is expected to unveil fresh details of the pension plans.  Mr. Macron has promised to standardize 42 public and private pension schemes into one state-managed, point-based plan. But for many protesters, nothing less than the future of their vaunted social safety net is at stake. Many fear losing money and having to work longer before retiring. The protests have already unleashed days of public transportation chaos that halted trains and led to canceled flights. On Saturday, the impact of the continuing strike was limited, since weekday workers did not have to commute. But train traffic was still heavily disrupted across France, and some businesses have started expressing worries that the strike could affect Christmas shopping. “This new movement and the risk of continuing strikes are a further hard blow for shopkeepers who were already seriously affected by one year of the Yellow Vest movement,” said Yohann Petiot, the head of the Alliance du Commerce trade group, in a statement.  Only one in six scheduled high-speed trains was running, and in Paris, nine out of 16 metro lines remained shut down. Unrelated protests by truck drivers over fuel tax hikes worsened the disruptions, as trucks were used to block highways and tollbooths, slowing traffic to a crawl in places like Normandy and the Toulouse region.  France’s national railway company, S.N.C.F., warned residents of Paris and its suburbs that crowds at some regional express stations on Monday could be “dangerous” because there were expected to be five times fewer commuter trains.  “S.N.C.F. is asking those who can to cancel their trips,” the company said on Twitter.  Labor unions, expecting a protracted struggle against the government, have activated strike funds to mitigate the loss of income for striking workers. Some supporters of the protesters have also started fund-raising campaigns.  One was even started on Twitch, the video game streaming platform, where a collective of streamers and artists have vowed to keep broadcasting games, artwork and political discussions as long as the strike continued.  The stream  has raised more than 33,000 euros, nearly $36,500, so far.  “It is not always possible to take to the streets or to go on strike,” the collective said on the website for the project. It added that it was important to “invent new spaces for mobilization and other ways of accompanying the movement.” (The French government has had similar ideas.)  Mr. Philippe lamented in a televised address on Friday the spread of “fake news” about the pension overhaul. He specifically blamed a number of “simulators” that some unions have put online to show people how they would be affected by the changes, under which workers would accumulate points over the course of their careers and cash them in when they retire. Noting that the details of the plan had yet to be unveiled, he said that such simulators “correspond to nothing.”  But the lack of clarity from the government has left many people in France fearful that their pensions will be diminished.  Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, said on Saturday that the “real problem” for French workers was that they retired “too late” and “too poor.” “We have three days left to put the maximum amount of pressure so that it gives up on the idea of a point-based retirement system,” Mr. Mélenchon, speaking to reporters in Marseille, said of the government.']",Few trains were running and most Paris metro lines were closed in the face of a strike and the long-running protests.
Call It a Crime of Pasta,2019-12-07,By Jason Horowitz,"['BARI DISPATCH The famous pasta-making women of Bari, Italy, are worried that a crackdown on contraband orecchiette pasta could threaten their way of life. By Jason Horowitz BARI, Italy — The grandmothers set up shop early. Out of ground-floor kitchens that opened directly onto the street, they came out singing old songs, sweeping the stone floor and scattering their homemade orecchiette, the city’s renowned ear-shaped pasta, on the mesh screens of wooden trays. As the pasta dried in the sun along with the sweatpants, T-shirts and bath towels draped from the balconies above, Nunzia Caputo, 61, sat making more with her mother. A local man popped by to buy a kilo, which Ms. Caputo weighed out on an old-fashioned scale. “Here it’s always fresh,” she said, in a kitchen cluttered with simmering pots of sauce, sacks of semola flour and a muted television. “If nobody buys them, we eat all of them. And this happens,” she said, pointing at her belly. The scene — the grannies, the handmade pasta, the curved stone street — evoked the southern Italy of popular imagination.  The orecchiette makers of via dell’Arco Basso in the southern coastal town of Bari have drawn cruise ship tourists, and contributed to Lonely Planet naming Bari one of Europe’s top 10 destinations.  They also inspired Dolce & Gabbana to film a cosmetics ad (“Pasta, Amore e Emotioneyes”) in which Sylvester Stallone’s adult daughters strut down the street in black negligees, dance with the grandmas and sift orecchiette through their fingers. But local officials suspect that the pasta street, in the historical part of town known as Old Bari, is the scene of a crime that has prompted the orecchiette crackdown scare of 2019. According to the mayor’s office, in mid-October police inspectors busted a local restaurant for serving untraceable orecchiette, a violation of Italian and European Union regulations that require food in restaurants to be clearly sourced. The police fined the restaurateur and forced him to trash three kilos of pasta, or about seven pounds.  The November news reports  (“Strong hand against the handmade orecchiette in Old Bari” wrote La Repubblica) immediately worried the sharp-elbowed women of Bari, who are permitted to sell small plastic baggies of pasta for personal use, but who are not licensed to deliver large, unlabeled shipments to restaurants.  The women don’t earn much to begin with, and fear having to wear hairnets, issue receipts and pay taxes. People here are asking if the Italian zeal for regulations, however often ignored, will end up overpowering the local pride in a custom that has brought Bari — where many families have their go-to pasta lady — tourists and much-needed good press.  The mayor, Antonio Decaro, has promised to work something out. In the meantime, he has apparently advised the grannies to lay low. “Our first citizen told us not to say a word about this,” Ms. Caputo said, referring to Mr. Decaro. “No information. That it’s bad for us.”  Another nonna, an 82-year-old who spent a recent morning singing old songs (“This love had me in chains”) and would only be identified as Vittoria, said, “Here everyone is scared that the financial police is going to crack down on us.”  As the grandmother threatened a reporter for asking too many questions, the neighbor across the street blasted AC/DC’s rock anthem “Thunderstruck,” which he called “self-defense” against her constant singing and sharp tongue. “She’s nice if you are passing by for two minutes,” the neighbor said, but added that she was hard to live across from.  [Read: Departing: Two Shopkeepers, Their Cat and Part of Paris’s Soul.] On the opposite end of the street, Angela Lastella, 64, stood surrounded by clear plastic bags of orecchiette, taralli crackers and sun-dried tomatoes. She shooed away a carb-hungry pigeon and cooed at local nursery school children on a field trip to the street, but clammed up on the topic of orecchiette trafficking.  Asked about a possible proposal for the women to join together to more legally sell their goods, she shouted with exasperation, “Who’s going to make a cooperative?” Until 20 years ago, Old Bari was known as “Mugging-town,” a forbidden zone run by criminal clans. Theft has a long tradition here. In 1087, Barese sailors looking for a pilgrimage attraction stole from present-day Turkey the bones of St. Nicholas, the model for Santa Claus and now one of Bari’s patron saints. (And the patron saint of, among other things, thieves.) The relics are still in Bari’s San Nicola basilica. More recently, Vito Leccese, the mayor’s chief of staff, said his boss received a police bodyguard after taking on criminally linked street-food vendors and upset some traditionalists for prohibiting locals from selling raw mussels rinsed in seaport water. Before pasta, he said, many of the city’s older women sold contraband cigarettes from Montenegro. “We are trying to help them,” he said, adding that the administration was looking into the possibility of making the area a free-trade zone and that there was nothing wrong with them selling a couple of kilos to the occasional orecchiette user off the books. “It doesn’t hurt anyone,” he said. The law did not seem of primary concern to many around town. At l’Osteria delle Travi, waiters brought out heaping plates of orecchiette, which Nicola Fiore, a manager, said was not sourced to the women of l’Arco Basso, but to “another lady,” across town. Many locals argued that the regulations represented the real threat. “These women work 10, 15 hours a day, seven days a week to support their unemployed husbands and sons,” said Francesco Amoruso, 76, whose mother, one of the street’s venerable pasta makers, died last year at age 99. “And this is who they come down hard on?” Michele Fanelli, an advocate for local traditions who also offers classes in orecchiette making, has stepped forward to defend the women, arguing that they are last vestiges of a disappearing Bari. “Globalization is threatening the traditions,” he warned before walking into Ms. Caputo’s kitchen. He talked orecchiette and globalization with Ms. Caputo and her mother, Franca Fiore, 88. Ms. Fiore, when asked about the inspections, shrugged: “They’re right. Taxes and things like that. It’s all off the books.”  As the women pounded, sliced and nimbly molded the dough, Ms. Fiore said her own mother taught her how to make the pasta as a little girl to feed her father and seven brothers. Ms. Caputo said her mother’s mother had also “obligated” her to make orecchiette starting at age 6. (Ms. Lastella, the pasta-maker from down the street, had earlier said it was a prerequisite for marriage.) They meant this in a good way.  “We have to transmit these values to the next generation,” Ms. Caputo said. “Everything now is based on technology, all the kids with their technology.” “Globalization,” Mr. Fanelli concurred. “They should help us pass this tradition down, not exterminate it,” Ms. Caputo continued. “You should teach it at school. You have kids now who can speak two or three languages but can’t do this. If you give them a little ball of dough, their eyes light up.” “The Gospel according to Nunzia,” her son, Rino Caputo, 43, said dismissively as he walked by to stir a pot of peas. In the evening, as the women brought their trays of pasta into kitchens adorned with St. Nicholas shrines, Diego De Meo, 44, the owner of the restaurant Moderat, across from City Hall, waited for the evening rush.  He said he didn’t know which restaurant was caught serving contraband orecchiette but talked about how those little irregular, handmade pasta ears had “a little magic in them.” He suggested that trying to regulate Bari was like trying to straighten the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  “Sometimes the irregular is what makes things beautiful,” Mr. De Meo said. Pressed further for a hint on the identity of the offending restaurant, he paused awkwardly. “It was me,” he blurted out, adding that he alerted other restaurants, many of which he said bought orecchiette from the women. “Look, it’s correct, it’s the law,” he acknowledged, referring to the fine. But while his business was unaffected, he felt bad for the women of Bari who he said “are perplexed.” The pasta sting left him bewildered too.  As the cops rifled through his orecchiette stash and inquired about his dealer, he recalled looking at them with astonishment and asking, “Aren’t you guys from Bari?”']",
U.K. Halts Torture Case Against Ex-Wife of Liberia’s Charles Taylor,2019-12-07,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A British judge has dismissed torture charges against the ex-wife of a former Liberian president before her trial next month over accusations relating to the country’s civil war. Agnes Reeves Taylor, the ex-wife of former President Charles Taylor, was arrested in London in 2017 and charged with eight counts of torture and conspiracy to commit torture as part of her husband’s National Patriotic Front of Liberia, which in the 1990s participated in one of Africa’s bloodiest recent civil wars.  But a judge at the Old Bailey in London, the central criminal court for England and Wales, ruled on Friday that there was not enough evidence to prove that the group had governmental control in the areas where the atrocities were said to have taken place — a requirement for the case to be tried in Britain. The case had been viewed as an important test for those seeking to see torture in other countries punished in British courts. The country’s Supreme Court decided in a landmark ruling last month that members of nonstate groups that exercised “the functions of government” during armed conflicts could be prosecuted in Britain. More than 200,000 people died in clashes and atrocities as the National Patriotic Front of Liberia led an insurgency in the 1990s. Mr. Taylor was elected in 1997 but went into exile in 2003. At a trial in The Hague in 2012, he was sentenced to 50 years in prison after he was found guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Ms. Reeves Taylor had been accused of ordering soldiers to rape women and to beat a 13-year-old boy, among other crimes.  British court documents also said that she had ordered soldiers to tie up and torture a woman who refused to be raped by one of Mr. Taylor’s local commanders, and that she later shot and killed the woman’s two children, saying, “See, if you refuse an order, this will happen.” Ms. Reeves Taylor, 54, has denied the accusations, and said that she had never held any official position in the National Patriotic Front of Liberia. The Old Bailey judge, Mr. Justice Sweeney, said on Friday that a central question in prosecuting Ms. Reeves Taylor on torture charges was whether “at the time and location of each offense, the N.P.F.L. was exercising governmental function in the relevant area.” “In my view, the answer in each instance is clearly in the negative,” the judge said in a statement. Ms. Reeves Taylor watched the ruling by video link from a prison in Britain, according to the BBC and The Associated Press, and was set to be freed.  She claimed asylum in Britain in 2007, but her application to remain indefinitely was rejected in 2016 because of suspicions that she might have committed a crime against humanity or war crimes, according to court documents.  It was unclear whether Ms. Reeves Taylor could now stay in Britain. The decision on Friday was “heartbreaking for the victims who have waited more than 20 years for their stories to be heard by a court and for justice to be done,” said Emmanuelle Marchand, the head of legal analysis at Civitas Maxima, a group that seeks to provide legal representation for victims of international crimes.  Along with the Liberia-based Global Justice and Research Project, Civitas Maxima provided the British authorities with the initial information to conduct an investigation into Ms. Reeves Taylor. But Ms. Marchand and other representatives of rights groups said that despite the dismissal on Friday, the Supreme Court decision in November could still pave the way for further prosecutions of members of nonstate groups. “The Supreme Court has made clear that members of other armed groups that exercise sufficient control, such as ISIS and the Taliban, can be prosecuted for torture under U.K. law,” said Charlie Loudon, an international legal adviser at Redress, an anti-torture group based in Britain. A spokesman for Bark & Co, the legal firm that represents Ms. Reeves Taylor, welcomed the decision and said in a statement, “Agnes Reeves Taylor is now free to get on with her life and rejoin her loving family.” “She has been in prison since June 1, 2017, over two and a half years, for a crime she did not commit,” the statement said.

The Price of Recycling Old Laptops: Toxic Fumes in Thailand’s Lungs,2019-12-08,By Hannah Beech and Ryn Jirenuwat,"['KOH KHANUN, Thailand — Crouched on the ground in a dimly lit factory, the women picked through the discarded innards of the modern world: batteries, circuit boards and bundles of wires. They broke down the scrap — known as e-waste — with hammers and raw hands. Men, some with faces wrapped in rags to repel the fumes, shoveled the refuse into a clanking machine that salvages usable metal. As they toiled, smoke spewed over nearby villages and farms. Residents have no idea what is in the smoke: plastic, metal, who knows? All they know is that it stinks and they feel sick. The factory, New Sky Metal, is part of a thriving e-waste industry across Southeast Asia, born of China’s decision to stop accepting the world’s electronic refuse, which was poisoning its land and people. Thailand in particular has become a center of the industry even as activists push back and its government wrestles to balance competing interests of public safety with the profits to be made from the lucrative trade. Last year, Thailand banned the import of foreign e-waste. Yet new factories are opening across the country, and tons of e-waste are being processed, environmental monitors and industry experts say. “E-waste has to go somewhere,” said Jim Puckett, the executive director of the Basel Action Network, which campaigns against trash dumping in poor countries, “and the Chinese are simply moving their entire operations to Southeast Asia.” “The only way to make money is to get huge volume with cheap, illegal labor and pollute the hell out of the environment,” he added. Each year, 50 million tons of electronic waste are produced globally, according to the United Nations, as consumers grow accustomed to throwing away last year’s model and acquiring the next new thing. The notion of recycling these gadgets sounds virtuous: an infinite loop of technological utility.  But it is dirty and dangerous work to extract the tiny quantities of precious metals — like gold, silver and copper — from castoff phones, computers and televisions. For years, China took in much of the world’s electronic refuse. Then in 2018, Beijing closed its borders to foreign e-waste. Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia — with their lax enforcement of environmental laws, easily exploited labor force and cozy nexus between business and government — saw an opportunity. “Every circuit and every cable is very lucrative, especially if there is no concern for the environment or for workers,” said Penchom Saetang, the head of Ecological Alert and Recovery Thailand, an environmental watchdog. While Southeast Asian nations like Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have rejected individual shipments of waste from Western countries, Thailand was the first to push back more systematically against the electronic refuse deluging its ports. In June of last year, the Thai Ministry of Industry announced with great fanfare the ban on foreign e-waste. The police made a series of high-profile raids on at least 10 factories, including New Sky Metal. “New Sky is closed now, totally closed,” Yutthana Poolpipat, the head of the Laem Chabang Port customs bureau, said in September. “There is no electronic waste coming into Thailand, zero.” But a recent visit to the hamlet of Koh Khanun showed that the factory was still up and running, as are many others, a reflection of the weak regulatory system and corruption that has tainted the country.  Despite the headlines about the police raid, New Sky Metal was fined a maximum of only $650 for each of its licensing infractions.  Since the e-waste ban, 28 new recycling factories, most dealing with electronic refuse, began operations in one province east of Bangkok, Chachoengsao, where Koh Khanun is located, according to provincial statistics. This year, 14 businesses in that province were granted licenses to process electronic waste.  Most of the new factories are in central Thailand between Bangkok and Laem Chabang, the nation’s biggest port, but more provinces are allowing the businesses.  Thai officials say that some incinerators may still be burning because factories are working through old stockpiles. Plants may also be processing domestic rather than foreign refuse, they say. But neither explanation is likely, according to industry experts. Hoards of imported waste wouldn’t last this long. And the amount of electronic trash that Thailand produces is far outpaced by the number of new factories. Foreign e-waste might be smuggled into the country mislabeled as scrap, said Banjong Sukreeta, the deputy director general of the Department of Industrial Works. “Ask customs about falsified declarations,” he said. “Rules are not enough if the people who implement them are not up to it.” But Mr. Yutthana, of the customs bureau, said every box that landed at his port was inspected thoroughly. “We are 100 percent careful,” he said. In October of this year, the Thai legislature unveiled loosened labor and environmental regulations for all factories, a move that has benefited the e-waste industry. Under one provision, small companies are no longer subject to pollution monitoring.  At the same time, a draft bill that would ensure tighter control over Thailand’s electronic waste industry has languished in legislative purgatory.  “Thailand is welcoming environmental degradation with its own laws,” said Somnuck Jongmeewasin, a lecturer in environmental management at Silpakorn University International College. “There are so many loopholes and ways to escape punishment.” The consequences are frightening.  If some types of electronic waste aren’t incinerated at a high enough temperature, dioxins, which can cause cancer and developmental problems, infiltrate the food supply. Without proper safeguarding, toxic heavy metals seep into the soil and groundwater. Locals who fought against the deluge of trash have been attacked.  “Why don’t you in the West recycle your own waste?” said Phayao Jaroonwong, a farmer east of Bangkok, who said her crops had withered after an electronic waste factory moved in next door. “Thailand can’t take it anymore,” she said. “We shouldn’t be the world’s dumping ground.” Phra Chayaphat Kuntaweera, a Buddhist abbot, has watched as several waste-processing factories opened around his temple. Two more are under construction. First, the monks began to cough, he said. Then they vomited. When the incinerators burned, their headaches raged. “Monks are people, too,” he said. “We get sick from the fumes just like anyone else.” Earlier this year, the abbot put a sign in front of his temple in Khao Hin Sorn, east of Bangkok. “Cheap temple for sale,” the banner read, blaming “fumes from burning factories” for the desperate measure. At King Aibo Electronics Scrap Treatment Center, one of the factories near the temple, schedules written in Chinese note the dates that shipments will be arriving. The three workers in the office on a recent visit were all Chinese. “We know that Chinese people set up factories in Thailand,” said Mr. Banjong of the industrial works department. But he said that since the ban on electronic waste was instituted, “we are more strict.”  King Aibo is one of the factories that began operations this year.  Other factories never shut down, despite repeated infractions.  One, Set Metal, was ordered to shut in April 2018, officials said. It never had a license to import electronic waste, and locals complained about the stench.  But on a recent visit, a Thai-Chinese interpreter, speaking through a gate, said the company was open for business, even if some operations had moved to a nearby village. Behind him, containers overflowed with electronic waste. About 100 Burmese workers live on the factory’s grounds. Even in cases in which wrongdoing is acknowledged, follow-through is weak. This year, officials admitted that 2,900 tons of electronic waste seized in last year’s raids had gone missing.  The police had left the stockpile in the care of the Chinese manager, who later skipped the country. In September, Sumate Rianpongnam, an activist, campaigned against the e-waste industry’s polluting his hometown, Kabinburi. That night, men on motorcycles shot bullets into the air near his home and raced off. Shortly afterward, men in a pickup truck tossed small grenades, known as Ping-Pong bombs, at his friend’s house. The grenades exploded, but the friend was not injured. Others weren’t as fortunate.  In 2013, a village chief spoke out about the illegal dumping of toxic waste. He was shot four times in broad daylight. The man charged with ordering the killing, an official in the local Department of Industrial Works, was acquitted in September. Mr. Sumate and his friend were campaigning against a landfill that illegally mixes electronic waste and household rubbish. On a visit to private land adjacent to the landfill, muscled men packed in a pickup truck tried to block the path out. “I’ve chosen to do this work,” Mr. Sumate said. “I am not scared of death.” In the shadow of the corroded smokestack at New Sky Metal, Metta Maihala surveyed her eucalyptus plantation. The lake that waters the farm has clouded over, and the smell is nauseating. Suddenly, through the rows of trees, a pair of Burmese workers emerged. The man showed burns on his arms from his work at New Sky Metal but said he had no idea what liquid had caused his wounds. The woman, Ei Thazin, said she received $10 a day for sorting metal. “I didn’t know this was dangerous work,” she said. In Thailand, millions of undocumented workers from poorer countries like Myanmar and Cambodia are vulnerable to abuse, environmental watchdogs say, adding that the need for such laborers will only intensify.  Of the 14 factories granted licenses to process e-waste this year in Chachoengsao Province, six are in Koh Khanun. Five are linked to the man whose name is associated with New Sky Metal, or with his wife. “We can’t choose the air we breathe,” said Ms. Metta, the eucalyptus farmer. “Now there will be even more factories. We are all going to die a slow death.”']","The e-waste industry is booming in Southeast Asia, frightening residents worried for their health.

"Brexit Will Bring a Baby Boom, Boris Johnson Promises",2019-12-08,By Yonette Joseph,"['LONDON — Add this head-scratching prediction to the list of campaign-trail utterances made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Brexit is sure to inspire a baby boom if he remains in office. Mr. Johnson made the remarks in an interview published by The Sunday Times of London this weekend as Britain hurtles toward a pivotal election on Thursday.  He has characterized a vote for his Conservative Party as the only way “to get Brexit done.” But he’s now suggesting that the British, in a frenzy of celebration, would rush to procreate after the country left the European Union and the results would mirror a supposed baby boom in 2012, which he attributed to the London Olympics that year, when he was the city’s mayor.  “Cupid’s darts will fly once we get Brexit done,” he was quoted as saying. “Romance will bloom across the whole nation. There was one after the Olympics, as I correctly prophesied in a speech in 2012, it was quite amazing. There was a big baby boom.” The remarks — immediately derided by commentators and social media users — counter all evidence that the drawn-out Brexit process has traumatized the country and divided it into warring camps such as the Leavers, the Remainers, the Fed-up and the Get It Over With Already.  The comments occurred amid a feverish, last-minute dash across the country by politicians to persuade voters ahead of Election Day. They also came on the same day that Mr. Johnson promised to limit immigration if his party gained a majority, by making it harder for “unskilled workers” to enter Britain. The baby-boom prediction stood out in an election campaign that has been overshadowed by scandals and concerns, including fears of Russian interference in the vote; accusations that the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has failed to tackle the scourge of anti-Semitism in his Labour Party; claims about dirty tricks by Mr. Johnson’s party; and Labour’s unveiling of leaked documents purporting to show that the National Health Service would be up for discussion in a post-Brexit British-American trade deal, even though Mr. Johnson has vowed that it would not. [Read: Battered at the polls, pro-Europe Britons gird for the next fight.] But the Brexit babies comments were indicative of Mr. Johnson’s proclivity for making outlandish, often-dubious, claims that lead to howls of public ridicule or outrage but for which he suffers no real consequence. For instance, he said in a 2013 interview with “Voices From Oxford” when he was mayor of London that female suffrage happened only because men realized that women could “run them down” with cars.  “I think that women’s liberation, female suffrage, probably wouldn’t have happened, if it hadn’t been for the motorcar,” he opined. Mr. Johnson was also raked over the coals for a 1995 article in which he described the children of single mothers as “ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate,” and referred to single mothers as “uppity and irresponsible women.” In this latest case, a senior reporter at the newspaper that published Mr. Johnson’s prediction, Rosamund Urwin, promptly called it “nonsense” during on a segment on the BBC on Sunday. Others called it “silly.” There’s one very clear reason to doubt the idea of an Olympic baby boom, as commentators on social media were quick to point out. While 2012 was indeed a big year for British babies — there were 729,674 live births in England and Wales, according to Britain’s Office for National Statistics, the most in over four decades — the London Games were a summer event, too late to affect that total.  Any Olympics-inspired babies would have arrived in 2013, when births declined by more than 30,000.  What’s more, the high in 2012 was not a one-off boom but the culmination of a yearslong trend. “It’s just been gradually building up,” Paul Vickers, a statistician at the O.N.S., told The Guardian at the time.  The uplift was linked to a number of factors, including migration, greater fertility among older women and shifting social attitudes about parenthood, as well as to grandchildren of those born in the post-World War II baby boom reaching childbearing age.  And though its effects are still rippling through British schools, the trend has since gone firmly into reverse. Last year, live births in England and Wales were nearly 10 percent down on the 2012 peak, and the total fertility rate had fallen to 1.7 children per woman, down from 1.94 in 2012. In 2018, the country’s population stood at more than 66 million. The Sunday Times also disputed the Olympic angle on the number of babies born in 2012: It said, apparently tongue in cheek, that the cause was linked to the release of the erotic novel “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Peter Robins contributed reporting.']",Another dubious claim has drawn attention on the campaign trail in the lead-up to British elections on Thursday.
At Least 43 Dead in New Delhi Building Fire,2019-12-08,By Sameer Yasir and Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — At least 43 people were killed Sunday morning when one of the worst fires in recent memory in New Delhi broke out in a cramped, commercial neighborhood, officials said. The blaze erupted around 5:30 a.m. in a multistory building used for making paper products and purses. Atul Garg, New Delhi’s chief fire officer, said firefighters initially struggled to douse the flames because narrow lanes blocked access to the area, which is full of dilapidated buildings.  “This is the second-biggest fire in Delhi’s history,” he said. The building in the Anaj Mandi neighborhood of northeastern New Delhi was packed with sleeping laborers when the fire broke out. Most of the victims were Muslim migrant workers from impoverished Bihar State in eastern India, The Associated Press reported. They earned as little as 150 rupees (about $2.10) per day making handbags, caps and other garments, it said.  Investigators blamed an electrical short-circuit for the fire, The A.P. reported. Safety standards are poorly enforced in India and are linked to many deaths.  Kishore Kumar, an official at Lok Nayak Hospital, where victims were taken, said most of the dead appeared to have suffocated as they slept. He said at least 20 other people were being treated for injuries. “Their only fault was they were poor,” a man named Babar Ali, 32, told the AP. “Why else would someone work and sleep in such a congested place?” Mr. Ali, who used to work in the same building, called the workers’ difficult lives “a bigger tragedy than their death.” In Anaj Mandi, residents climbed to the roofs of their buildings to watch the tragedy unfold as rescuers struggled to evacuate the injured. It took firefighters nearly an hour to control the fire because only one vehicle could reach the building. Inside, rescuers found at least 50 people unconscious. When they broke gates obstructing access to the top floor, they discovered more workers sleeping. “It was very dark inside,” said Sunil Choudhary, a fire department officer.  The chief minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, announced compensation of about $14,000 to relatives of each person who died. The government has opened a seven-day investigation into the disaster.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the blaze “extremely horrific” in a post on Twitter. “My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones,” he said.  Fires occur regularly in India, largely because of faulty electrical wiring and lax fire and building regulations. Last year, a fire at an industrial building on the outskirts of New Delhi left at least 17 dead. And in February, at least 17 people were killed when a blaze broke out in a hotel. Even deadlier was a blaze at a theater in June 1997, when 59 people were killed at Uphaar Cinema in one of the city’s most upscale areas. Hari Kumar contributed reporting.']","Firefighters were stymied by narrow alleys near where the blaze erupted, in a building used for making paper products and purses."
‘We Are Fleeing the Law’: Hong Kong Protesters Escape to Taiwan,2019-12-08,,"['Video by Cora Engelbrecht, Caroline Kim, Vivien Wong and Orlando de Guzman Text by Cora Engelbrecht TAIPEI, Taiwan — Sporting T-shirts, tousled hair and backpacks, the trio slumped around a cafeteria table in the Taipei airport looked more like stranded students than a group of protesters on the run. A few nights before, they were hurling Molotov cocktails on the front lines of the anti-government protests that have roiled Hong Kong for months. But after the police arrested two of their friends, they feared they would be next. Desperate, they sent a cry for help to a private online group known for helping people escape to Taiwan. Within hours, they were on a plane to Taipei, the capital. “We are fleeing the law,” said one of the protesters, her eyes darting across the food court. “We didn’t have much time to figure out what is happening.” Leaving the airport, the group hopped into a black van and sped away, headed for an uncertain future. They are among the more than 200 young protesters who have fled to Taiwan since the start of this year’s Hong Kong democracy movement, according to lawyers, pastors and other supporters who have helped them leave. The lawyers said dozens of protesters had arrived in recent weeks, after getting trapped on university campuses besieged by the police. Their flight is being fueled by fear, as the street clashes between demonstrators and the authorities have grown more violent.  Demonstrators regularly face tear gas, batons and water cannons at the hands of the police. Embittered that the movement’s peaceful tactics didn’t work, some protesters have turned more aggressive, vandalizing buildings and throwing bricks at the police. Since the protests started in June, more than 5,000 people have been arrested, and hundreds have been charged and may face harsh sentences.  While many vow to fight indefinitely, a mounting climate of mistrust is prompting some demonstrators to leave Hong Kong.  They worry they won’t be treated fairly in court. Or they fear abuse in detention, citing allegations of sexual assault and rumors of torture. Others are seeking medical treatment in Taiwan, after learning of arrests taking place in Hong Kong’s hospitals. The protesters and organizers aiding the escapes stressed that certain details and identities must be kept secret, so as not to endanger the operation.  “They know that throwing a brick can land them up to 10 years in prison,” said Chris Ng, a lawyer who has been defending arrested protesters. “They have lost faith in the judicial system of Hong Kong.” Mr. Ng said he had been in court hearings where protesters didn’t appear and probably had fled Hong Kong. “Even if they are willing to accept the legal consequences, they do not trust — and with good reason — that they will be dealt with in a fair system, or receive a punishment proportionate to their crime,” Mr. Ng said. Along the pipeline from Hong Kong to Taiwan, a clandestine network of sympathizers has sprung into action, quietly operating safe houses and orchestrating exits. Wealthy donors and aid groups are paying for airplane tickets. Volunteers are ferrying protesters to and from airports. Fishermen are selling boat rides for as much as $10,000 per person. Pastors are fixing smuggling routes for arrested protesters whose passports have been taken away.  “I am getting used to unexpected congregations,” joked Chun Sen Huang, an energetic 54-year-old pastor of the Chi Nan Presbyterian Church in Taipei who has emerged as a prominent player in the network. The pastor works as a liaison, coordinating travel plans with organizers in Hong Kong, arranging accommodation at properties owned by churches and connecting protesters with lawyers, doctors, aid groups and schools throughout Taiwan. These days, he said, he is constantly on his phone fielding requests, even during sermons and between prayers.  Mr. Huang said he recently learned of a protester who said she had been raped by the Hong Kong police and needed a boat to smuggle her to Taiwan so that she could receive an abortion.  At least 10 students arrived by plane after escaping from the campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where the police and protesters were in a standoff for days. Mr. Huang connected them with a lawyer who helped them get temporary student visas through a Taiwan university.  A mother called, looking for a new guardian for her 14-year-old son, who had thrown Molotov cocktails. Taiwan, a self-governing island, is a convenient and welcoming refuge. Like Hong Kong, it has a history of receiving dissidents from the mainland. While Beijing views Taiwan as part of China, Taiwanese leaders assert their sovereignty.  Many Taiwanese have supported the protests, concerned about the Chinese government’s encroachment on Hong Kong and what it means for the future of their own democratic island.  The protests were initially set off by outrage over an extradition bill, since withdrawn, that would have allowed Hong Kong’s leaders to send a fugitive to Taiwan to face murder charges, though the two entities have no extradition treaty. Protesters in Hong Kong said the legal change could have been used to send dissidents for trial in mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Even though Taiwan is welcoming protesters, the government is treading cautiously. It is wary of provoking Beijing by passing more permissive asylum laws. Many who arrive seeking refuge find themselves in a legal limbo, with only temporary visas. During his 22 years as a pastor in Taiwan, Mr. Huang said, he has helped several dissidents flee persecution from the Chinese government, but has never seen an operation of this scale. He said it was reminiscent of “Operation Yellowbird,” a secret network that smuggled hundreds of dissidents out of China and into Hong Kong after the massacre in Beijing around Tiananmen Square in 1989. At the time, Hong Kong was still a British colony.  “Darkness can never defeat light,” said Mr. Huang, as he ushered five arrivals into the church. “I believe democracy and freedom will certainly defeat totalitarianism.” For protesters considering whether to flee, the decision isn’t easy. Ali, a senior at Hang Seng University, has been arrested twice, on charges that could carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The second time, she said, she was held in a parking lot for 48 hours with 70 other protesters. “There was no privacy,” Ali said. She recalled how male officers entered bathroom facilities unannounced, and how she could overhear other protesters being interrogated. “They charged me with rioting without giving any explanation,” she added.  While detained, she missed her first day of work as an associate teacher at a primary school and was fired. As she awaits trial, her dream of becoming a teacher is slipping away. “It’s like imagining a past life,” she said.  “My future is ruined,” Ali said from her grandmother’s living room, where she lives. “It makes me wonder what is left for me.” Since her passport has been confiscated, she would have to rely on smugglers to take her by boat to Taiwan. Even then, she worries about leaving behind her 80-year-old grandmother. “She cannot take care of herself,” she said. “And I don’t know if I would be able to ever return.” Groups of volunteers provide a financial lifeline for protesters looking to escape.  One social worker in her 40s said she had paid for 11 protesters to get to Taiwan. With no children of her own, she said she feels a responsibility to help the young people. “If I get arrested, at least I can be proud that I tried to help these youngsters against totalitarianism,” said the social worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of legal repercussions. She started raising money for fleeing protesters in July, after a group of them stormed Hong Kong’s legislative building. She helped one 17-year-old whose parents had thrown him out of their home for joining the protests.  She mostly accepts donations in cash and in person — in order to avoid undercover police officers who sometimes pose as enthusiastic supporters. Almost every transaction begins with an encrypted private message to her phone and ends with a clandestine handoff.  “My mother always told me to repay old debts,” one donor wrote her one afternoon. She arranged to meet the stranger at a cafe. He handed her a cup of coffee with the equivalent of several thousand dollars coiled under its lid.  “The majority of Hong Kong people are unhappy,” she said.  “It’s not a small group of radical youngsters controlled and manipulated by the U.S.A.,” she added, citing one of Beijing’s claims that the West is provoking the protests. “The support is coming from all walks of life.” When protesters arrive through regular channels, the government in Taiwan generally grants monthly visas, which are usually renewable. A group of Taiwanese lawyers called HK_TW Support is helping some protesters apply for asylum, which would allow them to stay indefinitely. But none of the applications have been approved yet, according to Jacob Lin, one of the lawyers who represents the group. Daniel, a 22-year-old protester, has been living in Taiwan since July on an extended tourist visa. He describes his role in the early days of the movement as “fairly radical.”  After he stormed Hong Kong’s legislative building, his face was captured on surveillance footage. Two police officers stopped him on the sidewalk the next day and told him they recognized him. “At that moment I realized I could no longer deceive myself,” Daniel said. “I really had to leave home.” While he avoided arrest, he does not feel secure. He says he believes that his phone has been hacked and that he is being followed. His living costs are covered by a monthly stipend from an aid group in Hong Kong, but he fears the money won’t last. The stress has led him to see a psychologist, who diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder.  The hardest part, Daniel said, is the ache he feels for everything he left behind. Just before he fled, he said, he found himself in tears, standing at the bottom of the steps to his house. It’s a moment he replays in his head again and again. “I knew I might never come back to Hong Kong, and see home or my mother again,” he said.

"Facing Criticism Over Muslim Camps, China Says: What’s the Problem?",2019-12-09,By Chris Buckley and Austin Ramzy,"['BEIJING — On Twitter and YouTube, with slick videos and strident editorials, the Chinese government has gone on the offensive to reject mounting evidence that it is detaining Muslims in droves, depicting its critics as players in a Western conspiracy.  China’s aggressive media campaign comes after exposés published by The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists about the government’s drive to detain a million or more members of largely Muslim minority groups in indoctrination camps. The reports, which used leaked official documents to reveal the coercive workings of the camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, sharpened international criticism of China’s ruling Communist Party.  The pushback from China has escalated in recent days after the United States House of Representatives last week overwhelmingly supported a bill that could impose sanctions on Chinese officials overseeing the internment drive.  Chinese officials have accused Western lawmakers, experts and news outlets of maligning the government’s policies and stirring ethnic discord in Xinjiang. At a news conference in Beijing on Monday, Shohrat Zakir, the chairman of the Xinjiang government, dismissed the congressional bill as “crude meddling in China’s internal affairs.” He sought to foil the criticism by saying that the facilities — which Beijing calls vocational training centers — were now holding only people who were there voluntarily. Others who were previously in the facilities had “graduated,” he said, providing no specifics and declining to say whether they had been released.  He would not say how many people were currently or previously held. Uighurs and Kazakhs abroad have said they have seen no evidence of large-scale releases. Beijing’s case appears unlikely to win over experts who include officials from the United Nations. An abundance of evidence shows that the authorities have pursued a sweeping campaign to detain Uighurs and Kazakhs in camps designed to turn them into loyal supporters of the Communist Party.  Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch who has closely studied Xinjiang, said the party’s claims lacked credibility. “This comes from a government that pretty much lies about most reports coming from the region,” she said. “If the Chinese government has indeed released people from the camps,” she added, “then it should allow independent observers, including from the United Nations, to enter the region without any kind of restrictions to see for themselves.”  Beijing has said that its policies in Xinjiang are aimed at curbing extremism and have pulled the region back from bloody anarchy. The latest media campaign reflects the government’s confidence that its narrative could undermine independent Western analysis and news reports on the region, and perhaps blunt the push in some countries to censure China over the hard-line policies. On Twitter and in Chinese newspapers, Chinese commentators have accused prominent Western scholars of serving as tools of American intelligence agencies regarding Xinjiang. Twitter is banned within China, but that does not stop the government and its supporters from using the platform to make their case that the camps have stamped out attacks in Xinjiang. The Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Chinese Communist Party, published an interview with a regional government spokesman who said that two prominent foreign experts on Xinjiang, Adrian Zenz and Darren Byler, were cooperating with “anti-China forces in the U.S. to smear China’s Xinjiang policies.”  Mr. Byler, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, and Mr. Zenz, a senior fellow in China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, said the attack on them seemed to reflect growing anxiety among Chinese officials that they were losing the international argument over the camps. “Painting me and Darren Byler as intelligence agents is a very poorly done, crude, smearing counterattack,” Mr. Zenz said. “I think it’s very unconvincing. People are not believing them anymore.” Not all of China’s media offensive has dwelled on the claims of success in Xinjiang. China’s state-run international broadcaster, CGTN, posted several English-language videos on YouTube featuring footage of what it said were earlier attacks by Uighurs swept up in extremism and separatist movements.  The government showed one of the videos to journalists on Monday that included gruesome scenes from a 2014 attack by Uighur militants at a railway station in Kunming, in southwestern China, that killed 31 people and injured 141 others. “The horrific images and alarming number of violent crimes reveal the seriousness of the security situation in China’s western frontier,” the English-language voice-over says. “Chinese police have identified Xinjiang as a key battlefield.” Mr. Byler said the videos could help deflect criticism of the detentions by playing on exaggerated fears that Uighurs are susceptible to becoming terrorists. But the videos avoid fundamental questions about whether the scale of the government’s response is appropriate, he said. “They are missing that point where they go from ‘This handful of people did bad things’ to ‘We need to lock up 1.8 million or however many people are estimated in camps,’” Mr. Byler said. Former camp detainees who have left China have described numbing, harsh and even brutal treatment inside the facilities. Detainees are subject to constant indoctrination that warns them to renounce religious fervor and support the Communist Party. They are forced to study Chinese, memorize laws, practice marching and learn skills for factory work. Legal experts have said that even under China’s sweeping powers of detention, there is no sound backing for the camps, which subject inmates to months or years of detention without trial or effective means of appeal. Last month, six experts and officials on United Nations human rights panels also criticized the regulations that China has cited to justify the mass detentions, saying that the rules were “incompatible with China’s obligations under international human rights law.” China has also continued to put tremendous pressure on former detainees and other Uighurs who have spoken out about the campaign from abroad. Asiye Abdulaheb, a Uighur woman in the Netherlands who said she was involved in the release of the 24 pages of documents published by news outlets last month, has described being harassed and threatened.  “The Chinese police would definitely find us,” she said in an interview on Saturday. She described Chinese security officers as telling her ex-husband: “We know about all your matters. We have a lot of people in the Netherlands.” Zoe Mou contributed research.']","Chinese officials have released social media videos, blistering editorials and attacks on researchers in a push to counter evidence of its Muslim internment drive."
Violence Drives a Swell in Mexican Migration,2019-12-07,By Kirk Semple,"['CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — A crackdown on illegal immigration has sharply curbed the number of Central Americans and others trying to enter the United States. But Mexicans, who have not been bound by some of the same restrictions, have been showing up at the border in greater numbers, in many cases fleeing the escalating violence in their country.   Thousands have been stuck for weeks here in Ciudad Juárez and other border cities, waiting for permission to cross into the United States to apply for asylum. Human rights advocates say the bottleneck violates American and international law by forcing migrants to remain in a country where they feel their lives are at risk. “We’re fearful here because you never know whether at any moment someone’s going to come and kill someone,” said Juan, 55, a farm laborer from the state of Zacatecas who fled with 10 members of his family after his son escaped a criminal group that was pressuring him to join their ranks. “Wherever we are in Mexico, the gangs can find us,” said Juan, who, like many asylum seekers interviewed for this story, asked to be identified by his first name only out of fear for his safety. The Trump administration has aggressively sought to reduce immigration — legal and illegal — by implementing more restrictive measures. Those measures include returning migrants from various countries to Mexico while their immigration cases play out in American courts, and forcing migrants to first apply for asylum in countries they traveled through on their way to the United States. The Trump administration has also pressured the Mexican government to get tougher on illegal migration, leading to the deployment of thousands of Mexican security forces to help detain undocumented migrants as they travel north. Those strategies have led to a sharp drop in the number of migrants trying to cross into the United States, officials say. But the policies have had little impact on Mexican migration because Mexicans cannot be prevented from traveling through their own country to the northern border. And Mexican asylum seekers who have entered the United States, once they apply for protection, cannot be returned home unless their petitions are denied. While the overall number of migrants arrested along the southwest border has plunged, the number of Mexicans apprehended has risen: About 17,000 Mexicans were caught crossing between ports of entry in October, a 34 percent increase since July, according to the United States Customs and Border Protection. The number of Mexicans seeking American asylum has also shot up in recent months, advocates and Mexican officials say.  As the numbers have increased, American border guards have mostly turned away the asylum seekers at the official border entrances, saying they have no capacity to receive new applicants, migrants and their advocates say.  The practice has forced thousands of Mexicans to wait along the border for a chance to make their case in the United States. Here in Ciudad Juárez, they have been sleeping under plastic tarps in squalid encampments near the three main border bridges, enduring falling temperatures and bitterly cold rains. The Mexicans have joined many thousands of asylum seekers from other countries who have also been compelled to wait in Mexico after the United States began to severely restrict the number of cases it takes in a day, a system known as “metering.”  Migrants’ advocates say the bureaucratic backup is particularly dangerous for Mexicans, who are being forced to wait in the country they are trying to flee. The Trump administration “is focused on bringing immigration basically down to nothing and in doing so they’re again destroying a system set up by Congress to protect the most vulnerable arriving at our borders,” said Shaw Drake, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union Border Rights Center in El Paso. The A.C.L.U. filed a complaint last month with the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security calling for an investigation into the metering practice, with a special focus on the policy’s impact on Mexican migrants. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has quietly launched a pilot program in El Paso designed to expedite the adjudications of Mexican migrants seeking asylum — and speed the return of rejected applicants. The initiative comes as Homeland Security officials say they have been frustrated by the recent surge of Mexican migrants crossing the border. The Department of Homeland Security did not answer questions regarding the backup of Mexican asylum seekers along the border. On a recent morning, more than 1,500 Mexican asylum seekers were waiting in Ciudad Juárez. Some had been stuck there for as long as two months. Nearly all were from the states of Michoacán, Zacatecas or Guerrero — regions where organized crime groups flourish. A chilly wind was whistling through the encampment at the foot of the Córdova-Las Américas International Bridge, where Juan, the farm laborer, had settled with his family in September. Their shelter was a tent of plastic tarps where they bathed with water stored in five-gallon paint buckets, ate food distributed by charities and slept under donated blankets. The whole family was sick with colds, he said.  “For those of us who haven’t made it across, we have to shiver for a bit,” he said. “I hope the United States government softens its heart so that more people can cross before the freeze comes.”  Juan’s son Manuel, 24, said the family had continued to receive threats from the criminal gang that kidnapped him. Manuel’s sister pulled out her phone and displayed a series of menacing messages. One read, in part: “Hand over your brother to us because we already know where you are.” “These things aren’t easy,” Juan said. Waiting lists managed by the migrants themselves and handwritten in well-worn notebooks govern the order in which families cross. On some days a few are allowed in. On others, none.  The wait in the makeshift encampments has been grueling, but many migrants say they chose it over staying in one of the city’s migrant shelters because they feared that if they were not present, they would lose their place in line and miss their opportunity to cross. “When you leave your home, you leave with energy to deal with whatever you have to, because it’s better than what you have to deal with there,” said Martín, 37, a firefighter who fled his home in the state of Michoacan with his wife and three children because of violent persecution. He declined to provide further details to protect his identity and avoid jeopardizing his case.  Officials from the state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juárez is, say they have nothing to do with the Mexican lists because they do not want to be associated with something that might be against asylum law. American officials have attributed the timing of the surge in numbers of Mexicans trying to cross the border to a change in strategy by migrant smugglers who have seen their businesses collapse as migration from Central America has diminished. “They go to Mexico and they start taking out social media ads and going to Mexican nationals and telling them, ‘If you grab a kid, that’s your passport to the United States,’” Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in October. But some two dozen migrants interviewed in the Ciudad Juárez encampments said their decision had nothing to do with a smuggler’s marketing appeal. All said they were fleeing violence.  Some said that there had been a shift in the nature of violence in their home regions. Others said that while they had suffered violent persecution for months if not years, they only just learned about asylum and their possible eligibility. “Before, if you were pursued by the criminals, you just suffered it and suffered it until they killed you,” said Jacobo, 42, an agricultural laborer who fled his home in Zacatecas with his wife and two children. “But now we know about political exile.” Still others were motivated by rumors that the American authorities were allowing more Mexicans into the United States even while they were restricting access to Central Americans and others. Regardless of the timing, advocates say, the sheer numbers — and a failure in American border policy — have generated a crisis that deserves immediate attention. “These systems for considering and processing refugee claims exist for a reason,” said Mr. Drake of the A.C.L.U. The Trump administration “is not following the process that Congress requires them to and is thereby exposing thousands of people to potential harms that they should never have been exposed to.” Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting from Washington, and Caitlin Dickerson from New York.

"Days After New Zealand Eruption, Loved Ones Still Wait for News",2019-12-10,By Livia Albeck-Ripka and Daniel Victor,"['About 47 people were visiting White Island, an active volcano in New Zealand, when it erupted on Monday. Days later, many of their loved ones are still searching for information about them.  Eight deaths have been officially confirmed, including two who succumbed to their wounds at the hospital, and dozens of victims suffered injuries. On Wednesday, the New Zealand police released a list, which they said was incomplete, of nine missing people, of whom seven were from Australia and two from New Zealand. Family members of four people on the list confirmed that they were dead.  The toll was almost sure to rise. “We can never say 100 percent, but I would strongly suggest that there is no one who has survived on the island,” John Tims, the deputy commissioner of the New Zealand Police, said on Tuesday. Many of the hospitalized people had suffered severe burns, and the police said Tuesday that they were still trying to identify both the dead and the injured. Rescuers could not go to the island on Wednesday to retrieve victims’ bodies for fear that the volcano might erupt again. Mr. Tims said the 47 people, some of whom had gone to White Island on an excursion from a cruise ship, came from seven countries: 24 from Australia, nine from the United States, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two from Britain, two from China and one from Malaysia.  Here’s what we know so far about those who were there.  The New Zealand police told family members that Julie Richards, 47, and her daughter Jessica Richards, 20, of Brisbane, Australia, were among the dead, according to John Mickel, a family friend. Jessica was a student at the University of Queensland and an aspiring Australian rules football player, Mr. Mickel said. At a recent family gathering to celebrate the 85th birthday of Julie Richards’s mother, the pair discussed how excited they were about the cruise that would take them to White Island.  “If there was an adventure that offered itself, then they would be the ones to do it,” he told reporters.  In the minutes before the volcano erupted, Hayden Marshall-Inman, from Whakatane, New Zealand, was most likely guiding visitors carefully toward its crater, as he had done dozens of times before.  Friends and relatives said on Tuesday that Mr. Marshall-Inman, a guide and boat captain at White Island Tours, was among the dead. The police declared him officially missing on Wednesday. His brother, Mark Inman, wrote on Facebook that he had died “doing the one thing he loved.” Mr. Marshall-Inman, 40, was well loved by friends and colleagues, who described him as a gregarious, experienced and risk-averse guide.  “He would never enter that island or take people if he didn’t feel it was safe,” said Dawn Cobb, a close friend.  “There wasn’t a bad bone in that man’s body,” she added, describing him as “a simple New Zealand guy” who rarely wore shoes, traveled only with carry-on luggage and inspired the hundreds of international tourists who had participated in his tours. Mr. Marshall-Inman grew up in Ohope, a beach town on New Zealand’s northeast coast. He worked as a tour guide for several years before becoming a captain with White Island Tours, which is thought to have been guiding many visitors around the volcano on Monday. “A lot of the locals, they’ll be hurting,” said Stefen Leach, the manager of Ohope Chartered, a sports and recreation club where Mr. Marshall-Inman had previously worked. “It’s a tragedy.” Family members of Gavin Dallow, 53, said the New Zealand police had notified them of his death. Zoe Hosking, 15, his stepdaughter, is also presumed to have been killed, the family said.  “Gavin was a wonderful son and brother,” the family said in a statement. “We’ll miss him at the cricket and we’ll miss him at the football.” Lisa Dallow, 48, Ms. Hosking’s mother and Mr. Dallow’s wife, was recovering in a hospital with burns to 60 percent of her body, said Kym Loechel, a cousin of Mr. Dallow. “We don’t know if it’s survivable or not,” he said in an interview.  Mr. Loechel said Mr. Dallow loved to travel, but that he was conservative and “the last person I would have expected to be on White Island.” He described Mr. Dallow as dedicated to his local church and a linesman at the Australian Open tennis tournament.  He was “a very caring, very wonderful, happy bloke,” he said. Ms. Hosking was “very outgoing” and loved at her school, he said.  The New Zealand police said Tipene Maangi, 24, was missing as of Wednesday afternoon. A guide at White Island Tours, he had been “really enjoying” his job, Anihera Paku, a cousin of Mr. Maangi, told Newshub. Ms. Paku said Mr. Maangi had not been scheduled to work on Monday but was called in.  “He’s a really good people person, sociable, you could be having a really bad day and here comes Tipene and his cheeky remarks, just to brighten your day,” she said. “He’s just the laugh of the crowd.” Richard Elzer and Karla Matthews, both 32, were high school sweethearts who went to the island on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Mr. Elzer’s father, Peter Elzer, said they had not been heard from since Monday and were “presumed to be deceased.”  He said the couple was traveling with friends, who had provided him with more information than the authorities had. “We are frustrated by the lack of information provided to us from the Australian authorities up until now,” he told ABC. Matthew and Lauren Urey, of Richmond, Va., were on their honeymoon after getting married in October. Both survived the eruption but were sent to the hospital with extensive burns. “This isn’t a joke; the volcano actually erupted while we were on the island,” Mr. Urey said in a voice mail message to his mother, obtained by Inside Edition. “Lauren and I got pretty badly burned, so we’re at the hospital in New Zealand. My hands are burned so I can’t use my phone.” His mother, Janet Urey, told Inside Edition that her son had been “severely burned” on his arms, legs and back.  Lauren Urey’s mother, Barbara Barham, told The Washington Post that Lauren had excitedly called her on Monday after their cruise ship had docked in nearby Tauranga.  “My husband was joking around and said, ‘I hope it’s not a live volcano,’” she said.  Two Sydney teenagers, Berend Hollander, 16 and Matthew Hollander, 13, were confirmed dead by the private boys’ school in Sydney that they attended. Their parents, Martin and Barbara Hollander, remain missing, the school said. The family of four were aboard the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, and are believed to have been on White Island at the time of the eruption, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.  “It is with the greatest sadness that I can confirm that Matthew Hollander (Year 8) and Berend (known as ‘Ben’) Hollander (Year 10) have passed away in hospital as a result of injuries sustained in the White Island volcano eruption,” Scott James, the headmaster of Knox Grammar School, wrote in a letter sent to parents on Wednesday.  Mr. James described both boys as “enthusiastic” teenagers who had been involved in campus life and were popular among their peers. Berend, Mr. James added, was passionate about Australian rules football, cadets and baseball, and his brother had represented the school in basketball, squash and debating.

"Israel Heads to Record Third Election, Extending Deadlock",2019-12-11,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Having failed to form a government after two elections, Israel barreled toward a record third on Wednesday, extending the political deadlock that has paralyzed the country for nearly a year and assuring at least three more months of bitter, divisive campaigning and government dysfunction. And with the country hopelessly divided over the fate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been indicted on three counts of corruption, there is little indication that the third election will be any more decisive than the first two. Israel’s inability to break the logjam has raised questions about the political system its citizens often boast is the only democracy in the Middle East. A democracy often compared to that of Britain or the United States is now evoking comparisons to the less stable governments of Greece and Italy. “What used to be a celebration of democracy has become a moment of shame for this building,” Yair Lapid, a former finance minister and political rival of the prime minister, said on the floor of Parliament Wednesday night. The Parliament had until midnight Wednesday to form a majority government. But the hour passed with the two leading candidates for prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu and the former army chief Benny Gantz, unable to negotiate a power-sharing agreement.  Until a new government is created, Mr. Netanyahu remains prime minister of a caretaker government. By clinging to office, analysts say, Mr. Netanyahu would at least leave himself in better position to negotiate a plea bargain with state prosecutors, and could perhaps avoid trial altogether in exchange for retiring from public life. In the next election, expected to be in March, he will have to campaign as a defendant in three criminal cases: He was indicted on Nov. 21 on bribery and other corruption charges, accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls for lavish gifts and extravagantly positive press.  It is unclear whether the indictment itself will hurt his chances, though, since the outlines of the cases against him have been known for months. Israeli opinion polls show that another contest between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz would result in the same stalemate: Mr. Gantz’s Blue and White party nearly always comes out slightly ahead, but falls short of enough partners to form a majority coalition. A poll on Tuesday by Israel’s Channel 13, however, showed Blue and White opening up a four-seat lead over Likud, and the anti-Netanyahu parties combined reaching 60 seats, compared with 52 seats for the prime minister’s party and its allies. A 61-seat majority is needed to form a government. The circumstances have shifted in other unhappy ways for Mr. Netanyahu: He is now contending with a noisy rebellion in the ranks of his own conservative Likud party from a growing contingent of local officials and activists who fear that his refusal to step aside could hand power to Israel’s center-left coalition. Likud on Wednesday tentatively called a primary contest for the party’s leadership on Dec. 26.  So far, Mr. Netanyahu has managed to keep the rebels largely at bay by encouraging his political base to rage against the criminal justice system, fulminating against the news media and political rivals to his left, and dangling promises to the right that if he keeps job, he can capitalize on his close ties to the Trump administration to deliver historic achievements, including annexing territory in the occupied West Bank. Mr. Gantz’s chances in a third round of elections also may have improved after his No. 2, Mr. Lapid, agreed Monday to give up his longstanding insistence on eventually succeeding Mr. Gantz as party leader, and potentially as prime minister. Polls have shown that Mr. Lapid’s rotation agreement with Mr. Gantz was costing Blue and White two to four seats in Parliament. Most Israelis are fed up with the contest and resent the idea of having a third election. It will cost this small country some $500 million at a time when it is running a deficit, will prevent critical problems like overcrowded hospitals and failing schools from being addressed, and will make the military wait for approval of a new five-year spending plan despite growing threats in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Still, Yohanan Plesner, president of the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute, said Israel’s governing institutions remained robust, particularly the law-enforcement authorities that had just indicted a sitting prime minister for the first time. Despite inherent flaws in the electoral system and some legal ambiguities in how to deal with a prime minister under indictment, he said, “I don’t think there is cause for long term alarm.” Mr. Plesner also noted that Israel was in good company. Since the mid-1990s it has held elections an average of every 2.3 years, but it now looks more like Greece, which held three elections within 10 months. “This instability is not something to be proud of,” he said, “but it is our lot and at the same time Israeli democracy is solid.”  Israelis may be heading back to the polls in a fog of unprecedented and unresolved legal problems. While the law allows an indicted prime minister to remain in office, it says nothing about whether a candidate charged with serious offenses should be allowed to form a new government. Israel’s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, has so far avoided issuing an opinion on that question, saying it was still only theoretical. But on Monday, the Supreme Court asked him to say by next week if or when he would clarify his views. The brewing revolt within Likud adds to the challenges facing Mr. Netanyahu. Gideon Saar, a popular former government minister, has drawn a growing number of local officials into open opposition to Mr. Netanyahu. The only contender so far who has pledged to challenge Mr. Netanyahu in the party’s primary contest, Mr. Saar has argued that a third election with Mr. Netanyahu in charge could cost the right its hold on power. Mr. Saar’s campaign has unfurled a growing list of endorsements by Likud mayors, party leaders and officials in West Bank settlements.  “There’s been no proper government in Israel for more than a year and there’s no end in sight,” said Shimon Lankri, the Likud mayor of Acre, explaining why he switched to support Mr. Saar. As the calls for Mr. Netanyahu to step aside have grown louder, he has fashioned an elaborate argument for why he should be allowed to continue as prime minister, at least for the first six months of a rotation agreement with Mr. Gantz.  Given the Trump administration’s favorable disposition toward Mr. Netanyahu, he has argued, Israel’s right wing has a window of opportunity — which could close as the 2020 presidential election heats up, let alone if Mr. Trump is defeated — to press Mr. Trump for important new favors. Chief among them is approval for Israel’s annexation of the Jordan Valley, a loosely populated agricultural region where Mr. Netanyahu insists Israel must maintain a military presence under any settlement with the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu announced that he had spoken of the idea with Mr. Trump in a phone call on Dec. 1, and then with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a meeting in Lisbon on Dec. 4. But David Schenker, the assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, told reporters on Friday that Mr. Netanyahu had presented Mr. Pompeo no formal plan for annexing the area, and reaffirmed the administration’s view that “the ultimate disposition of territory is to be determined between the parties,” not through unilateral moves. Mr. Netanyahu is also talking up a defense treaty with the United States, although Israeli military leaders have long played down the wisdom of such an agreement, saying that Israel can already count on American support whenever it is needed and that a formal pact could tie Israel’s hands in a regional conflict. Polls show that most Israelis hold Mr. Netanyahu responsible for the return to the ballot box. But on the right, some of Mr. Netanyahu’s defenders have pinned the continued political impasse on Mr. Gantz for refusing to enter a unity government led by Mr. Netanyahu, if only for a few months, or on Avigdor Liberman, the leader of the ultranationalist, secular Yisrael Beiteinu party and a former Netanyahu ally who broke ranks with the right-wing, religious alliance. About the only thing the parties seemed ready to agree on was a new election date — though not without some Talmudic debate and another round of 11th-hour brinkmanship. The political calendar dictated Tuesday, March 10, but that is Purim, a Jewish feast when revelers often drink themselves into oblivion, not conducive to performing a sober civic duty. The prior Tuesday is a memorial day for fallen soldiers. The third Tuesday in March coincides with the anniversary of the death of an obscure Hasidic rabbi. Ultra-Orthodox parties were concerned that too many of their voters would be out of the country that day, making pilgrimages to the rabbi’s grave in Poland. Giving up on Tuesdays, the lawmakers tentatively agreed on Monday, March 2 — though that falls smack in the middle of the policy conference of Aipac, the pro-Israel lobbying group, a destination for a yearly pilgrimage to Washington by major Israeli politicians. But even a vote on that agreement was held up by haggling between Likud and Blue and White and was unlikely to be decided until Thursday morning. No matter the date, a third election may not be the charm. If that vote also fails to produce a government, Israeli law would mandate a fourth.']","Unable to form a government after two elections, the deeply polarized country will return to the polls for a third time in less than a year."
Why Were Tourists Allowed to Visit an Active New Zealand Volcano?,2019-12-10,By Jamie Tarabay and Damien Cave,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — Above the noise of the boat engine, there was quiet, Geoff Hopkins remembered. There was no rumble, no roar to signal that the White Island volcano had awakened.  The crater he’d just circled with his 22-year-old daughter, Lilani, erupted as they sat in a catamaran several hundred meters from shore, watching with other passengers as the island disappeared under ash. “A rolling rumbling mass of ash tumbled over the cliff face, in all directions, and it completely engulfed the island,” said Mr. Hopkins, a 50-year-old pastor. “It cut out the sun, it went dark. You couldn’t see that there was an island there. It was completely covered in ash."" That Mr. Hopkins, his daughter and dozens of others were allowed to go near the island — let alone scale the crater at its center — when geologists had repeatedly warned of increased volcanic activity is now the subject of an investigation, with the death toll from the eruption Monday having risen to six. As of Tuesday afternoon, eight others were also believed to have died, with emergency workers still unable to reach the island to retrieve them. And the question heard over and over in the long hours since, heard as the injured were carried to the docks, is: “Why?” Why was anyone — from retirees to children — allowed to tour the crater of an active volcano, despite warnings about bursts of gas and steam in recent weeks? Why would tour operators and cruise lines tout an adventure ride, with prices starting at $260 per child, at such risk?  And why, as of Tuesday, were there no clear answers to who is ultimately accountable for ensuring visitors’ safety: the family that owns the remote island, or the government charged with enforcing health and safety regulations? “There has to be more respect for nature. We can’t assume we can access anything we want,” said Jozua van Otterloo, a volcanologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who visited White Island — also known by its Maori name of Whakaari — in 2012. “This is something policymakers and the public need to consider. Even though this is such a great place, should we be allowing people to go in such large numbers?” The volcano is the island’s main draw. The town of Whakatane calls itself the “Gateway to White Island,” and much of the local economy is driven by tourist visits. Already, locals are concerned about the effect the eruption will have on the community as questions of disclosure and negligence swirl.  White Island has long been promoted as New Zealand’s most active volcano, appearing in “Lord of the Rings” and other blockbusters, when it is in fact little more than its dangerous apex. Around 70 percent of the volcano sits under the water, and tourists walk into its crater and up to the lip of its crater lake, peering into its cavity to see its endlessly boiling core. “You’re walking into this enclosed amphitheater, onto the floor of a very active volcano where there are steaming gas vents, where there are crater lakes filled with hot water close to boiling temperatures,” said Ray Cas, a volcanologist at Monash University who visited the crater twice, and on both visits believed it was a disaster waiting to happen. “That tells you there’s a source of heat under the volcano that is constantly supplying hot gasses and heating up fluids under the molten rock or magma,” he added. “Basically you have this hot cooker system at constant high temperature and high pressure that could explode at any time.” But New Zealand has long prided itself as a place where tourists could dance with danger. It was the first place in the world where you could bungee jump, and jet boating and blackwater rafting in caves are among its other attractions. That allure of adventure — natural beauty with a dash of risk — framed the excursion for visitors to the island on Monday.  Aboard the Ovation of the Seas, the Royal Caribbean cruise ship where most of the victims traveled from, the online promotion for the tour promised “a scenic boat ride along the picturesque Bay of Plenty to White Island for an unforgettable guided tour of New Zealand’s most active volcano.” “Get close to the drama,” it read. “Gas masks help you get near roaring steam vents, bubbling pits of mud, hot volcanic streams and the amazing lake of steaming acid. And the vivid hues of yellow and orange resulting from all sulfur on the island make for remarkable photos, so have your camera ready.” GeoNet, the agency that monitors geological activity in New Zealand, had reported increased activity at the volcano for several weeks, raising the warning level to 2 out of 5, while maintaining that the island was still safe for visitors. Now, more than 27 of the 47 people who were on the volcano when it erupted are suffering burns on at least 30 percent of their bodies, officials said. Mr. Hopkins, the pastor from the nearby town of Hamilton, watched with other passengers as the catamaran turned back to the island after the volcano erupted, and tour operators took rubber dinghies to the shore to seek out people who were still there. The crew came back with 23 survivors. All of them, he said, were “horrifically burned. Skin hanging off people, off their faces, off their arms.”  Mr. Hopkins and his daughter, both trained first-aid responders, along with other passengers who were doctors, tended to the victims, who ranged in age from students to retirees. His focus: Lauren and Matt Urey, American newlyweds from Richmond, Va. He worked to keep them conscious for the 90-minute boat ride back to the mainland. Ms. Urey’s mother is one of many who have asked, in anger, how such a tour could even exist.  The tours have been running for decades, under a deal between a handful of operators and the family that has passed down ownership of the land through several generations.  They fall under the jurisdiction of the 2016 Health and Safety at Work (Adventure Activities) Regulations, which require a safety audit for companies that “deliberately expose the participant to a serious risk to his or her health and safety that must be managed by the provider of the activity.”  White Island Tours, which was responsible for bringing most or all of the people to the island Monday, is a registered and approved tour provider. A little over a year ago, it won an award as one of the safest places in New Zealand to work.  But it’s not clear whether the company or government officials did enough to protect visitors to a location so remote that it can be hard to get a substantial number of people off the island and to safety quickly. Nor is it clear that the government will actively seek to hold anyone accountable. The New Zealand police said Tuesday that a criminal investigation had been opened. But later in the day they corrected that statement, saying it was “too early to confirm” whether there would be one. Employees at the office of White Island Tours declined to comment, as did New Zealand’s tourism minister and the area’s member of Parliament. Volcanologists with GeoNet, the agency that monitors geological activity in New Zealand, also declined to answer questions on Tuesday. And local residents hadn’t seemed to think twice about the risk. “I was going to buy one of those tours for my in-laws for Christmas,” said Karla Lyford, 24, who had been having lunch at the White Island Tours cafe when the eruption occurred at 2:10 p.m. local time. “White Island is so big here. It’s part of us. I was 14 when I went for a school trip, so it’s considered very safe. I’ve never — nor has anyone — considered it would be life-threatening.” Now, she said, she has no plans to go back, and many are wondering if tighter restrictions will put White Island off limits. After a violent eruption in 2002 on the Sicilian island of Stromboli, another active volcano where tourists often gather, visitor access was banned for months. In Hawaii as well, volcano tours have been restricted in the aftermath of eruptions — and many of those volcanoes are not considered as active or as dangerous as White Island.  “It’s a fair question to ask whether anyone should be allowed in an active crater at any given time,” said Mr. van Otterloo, referring to White Island. “In hindsight, it was an accident waiting to happen.” Jamie Tarabay reported from Whakatane and Damien Cave from Sydney, Australia. Sasha Borissenko contributed reporting from Whakatane and Alexander Bisley from Wellington, New Zealand.']",Visitors were allowed to tour the mouth of the White Island volcano despite recent warnings about bursts of gas and steam.
Sweden Charges Ex-Ambassador to China Over Secret Meetings,2019-12-09,By Iliana Magra and Chris Buckley,"['Sweden’s former ambassador to China has been charged with “arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power,” after she held what Swedish prosecutors said on Monday were unauthorized meetings with two men representing Chinese state interests. The announcement of the charges was the latest twist in a four-year-old case, in which a Swedish citizen was spirited to China from Thailand, the ambassador held what the authorities say were secret meetings in a Stockholm hotel, and ties between China and Sweden have been strained. The former ambassador, Anna Lindstedt, was accused earlier this year of arranging the talks between Angela Gui, the daughter of Gui Minhai, a Swedish bookseller detained in China, and two Chinese men who had offered to help free Mr. Gui in January. Instead of talks about freeing her father, Ms. Gui said, she was pressured to keep silent. After the talks at a Stockholm hotel, Ms. Gui accused Ms. Lindstedt, the ambassador at the time, of arranging the talks without authorization from the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The ministry opened an internal investigation into Ms. Lindstedt in mid-February.   “In this specific consular matter, she has exceeded her mandate and has therefore rendered herself criminally liable,” Hans Ihrman, the deputy chief public prosecutor for Sweden’s National Security Unit, said in a statement on Monday. Mr. Ihrman said the charge of arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power was “unprecedented.”  “We have looked way back to find any kind of indictment for this, but in modern times we have no trail of an investigation,” he said in a telephone interview. Mr. Ihrman described the meeting as an attempt by Chinese officials to stop Ms. Gui’s criticism of the Chinese government because of the treatment of her father.  “It’s about this daughter’s right to freedom of speech, which they have tried to act upon,” he said.  Nevertheless, he said, Ms. Lindstedt acted on her own without the necessary support or permission from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  The charge can bring a maximum prison sentence of two years under the Swedish Penal Code. A trial date for Ms. Lindstedt has not been set, Mr. Ihrman said. The Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported Monday that prosecutors chose a milder charge than what the government’s security service had sought, “disloyalty when negotiating with a foreign power,” which carries up to a 10-year sentence. A lawyer for Ms. Lindstedt, Conny Cedermark, said Monday in an email  that no crime had been committed. “Arbitrary conduct in negotiation with a foreign power has a series of prerequisites,” he said, and none of them had been met in the case. Mr. Gui was one of five Hong Kong-based publishers who were abducted and taken to China in 2015 after publishing books that were critical of the Communist Party elite, setting off international condemnation.  After being taken from Thailand to China in 2015, he was formally released two years later but was not  allowed to leave the country.  Mr. Gui was again detained early last year, when two Swedish diplomats tried to accompany him on a train from Shanghai to Beijing, where they planned to take him into the Swedish Embassy. But Chinese police officers boarded the train and took him into custody.  They said later that Mr. Gui was suspected of illegally providing state secrets, but gave no details or evidence. Soon after, the Chinese authorities brought Mr. Gui before a group of reporters, and he told them that the Swedish diplomats had wanted to spirit him back to Sweden. Mr. Ihrman, the Swedish prosecutor, said on Monday that Mr. Gui was in a Chinese prison.  Relations between Sweden and China have been strained since Gui Minhai was kidnapped in 2015, and tensions increased last month when the Swedish office of the writers’ group PEN said that it was awarding a literary prize to Mr. Gui. The prize is given annually to an author or publisher who is persecuted, threatened or living in exile. Three days later, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm called the prize a “farce” and threatened consequences if members of the Swedish government were to attend the award ceremony. A week later, Amanda Lind, Sweden’s minister of culture, not only attended the ceremony but also awarded the prize, despite warnings from the Chinese ambassador that Ms. Lind and other government officials working in the area of culture would no longer be welcome in China. Late last month, China appeared to follow through on its warning, with  SVT reporting that two Swedish films had been banned from screenings in China. Last week, after a seminar in Gothenburg, Sweden, on Swedish-Chinese relations, the Chinese ambassador to Sweden, Gui Congyou, told the newspaper Goteborgs-Posten that China would limit trade with Sweden because of its handling of the Gui Minhai case. “No one can think that they can harm China’s interests and at the same time draw great profits in the country,” the ambassador told the newspaper on Wednesday. “We must of course take countermeasures.”  In an interview with Goteborgs-Posten, Gui Congyou was reticent and cryptic but said that reprisals would not  be limited to cultural exchanges. Asked what areas other than culture could be affected, he said, “we will inform your colleagues at your Foreign Ministry.” Jesper Bengtsson, the chairman of Swedish PEN, said the organization was surprised by the “amazingly” strong response from China to this year’s award. “Governments and regimes have often reacted but never with threats, and threatening to block ministers from visiting China, Mr. Bengtsson said in a telephone interview, adding that the Swedish culture minister always attends the award ceremony. Previous prize recipients include Nasrin Sotoudeh, the Iranian human rights lawyer who is serving a 38-year prison sentence after being convicted of crimes against national security, and Dawit Isaak, a Swedish-Eritrean journalist who was arrested in Eritrea in 2001 on  security charges and has been imprisoned without a trial ever since.

Bougainville Votes for Independence From Papua New Guinea,2019-12-11,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The region of Bougainville, a collection of islands in the South Pacific, has voted overwhelmingly to become independent from Papua New Guinea, aiming to become the world’s newest nation. In a referendum linked to a peace agreement that ended a civil war between separatists and Papua New Guinea security forces nearly 20 years ago, nearly 98 percent of those who voted supported becoming an independent nation.  Excited voters gathered in Buka to hear the results — and they cheered when the sheer scale of the victory became apparent.  The nearly unanimous results exceeded what regional analysts had expected and could accelerate the independence movement, complicating diplomatic relations across the region.  With such a resounding vote for self-determination, Bougainville has become a visible inspiration for other independence movements in the Pacific, from West Papua, which is seeking to secede from Indonesia, to New Caledonia, which will hold a referendum next year about possibly breaking away from France.  For Bougainville — an area with huge mineral wealth and 250,000 people — the vote also makes it much harder for Papua New Guinea to move slowly through the consultation period required under the 2001 peace agreement that provided a pathway to independence.  “It puts the P.N.G. government in a pretty hard position,” said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. “If there were to be a smaller majority, say 55 or 65 percent, the P.N.G. government could have found a way to justify really stretching this out and having a period of negotiation that could last years or decades. “Now with such a phenomenal majority, it’s much harder for them to do that,” he added. Countries like Australia and New Zealand will also now find themselves squeezed — likely facing pleas for assistance from Bougainville to develop its institutions, and resistance from Papua New Guinea, which has never been eager to give up Bougainville’s bounty.  The islands have struggled against Papua New Guinea’s rule since the 1970s. At the time, Bougainville’s Panguna mine provided nearly half the entire country’s export income through gold and copper mining. But little tax revenue seemed to make it back to Bougainville.  Its economic grievances led the region to declare independence, or try to, in 1975. But Papua New Guinea ignored that push, and over the ensuing decades, tensions simmered and then exploded. Violence shut down the mine in 1989 and a nine-year war claimed the lives of 20,000 people. The Bougainville Peace Agreement granted the region more autonomy, and those who opposed secession hoped the pact’s lengthy timeline — allowing for a nonbinding referendum on independence within 20 years — would also prompt Papua New Guinea’s government to develop an equitable revenue-sharing deal for the mine, along with other services that might build loyalty to the central government. But that never happened.  “The P.N.G. government has squandered its opportunity,” said Wesley Morgan, a fellow at Griffith University’s Asia Institute in Queensland, Australia. Now, Bougainville has the potential to become the world’s newest nation, defining its own destiny and opening itself up to diplomatic and economic partnerships with nations that have shown increased interest in the Pacific as of late — including the United States and China.  “If the process plays out to a point where Bougainville is ceded its independence by the P.N.G. Parliament, then I imagine China would be very quick to offer its support in many ways, with aid, trade and investment,” said Mr. Pryke. “I can imagine they’d be very proactive.” ']",The nearly unanimous results in the Pacific islands chain exceeded expectations and could both accelerate independence and complicate relations across the region. 
U.K. Elections Explained: What to Know as Britain Votes,2019-12-11,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — For the second time since Britain voted to withdraw from the European Union, and with the country still deeply divided over the outcome, voters will head to the polls on Thursday for a general election.  With the future of Britain’s status in Europe still undecided after years of haggling, Brexit has inevitably been high on the agenda, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s vow to “get Brexit done” at the core of his Conservative Party’s campaign.  But the opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, has put health care at the center of its pitch to voters, framing itself as the defender of Britain’s revered National Health Service. Labour pledges to increase spending. It’s also arguing that Mr. Johnson could further privatize the service, or accept a trade deal with the United States that might lead to a steep increase in drug prices, claims that Mr. Johnson disputes.  With very different visions for the future of Britain laid out by the leaders of the country’s two main political parties, and several smaller parties also playing potentially decisive roles, here’s what to know ahead of the election.  Voters will be choosing a representative for their local district, or constituency, in Parliament. In total, 650 lawmakers — one for each district — will be chosen as members of the House of Commons, which decides the country’s laws and policies.  Any British citizen or citizen of the Commonwealth or Ireland who is 18 or over and lives in Britain could register to vote. (It’s too late now, though: The deadline was Nov. 26.) Elections are typically held every four or five years, but Parliament can vote to hold a new election whenever it wishes, and this will be the third since 2015. The polls open at 7 a.m. local time and close at 10 p.m., with the results of a usually reliable exit poll announced almost immediately after that. For the official results, all the ballot papers are counted by hand — some districts manage to declare a winner barely an hour after polls close, but most do so overnight. While the Conservative and Labour parties are Britain’s largest, several smaller parties are running candidates.  If one party wins more than half of the parliamentary seats, it will form the government, and its leader will become the prime minister.  For decades, such majority governments were by far the most common result. But that has happened only once in the past three elections. The other two produced “hung Parliaments,” with no party strong enough to govern on its own. In that case, the largest party usually has the first chance to assemble a parliamentary majority and form a government.  It can do so by agreeing to a formal coalition with one or more smaller parties and governing on a joint program, as the Conservatives did with the centrist Liberal Democrats after the 2010 election.  Or it can form a minority government, and seek a looser deal for smaller-party support on critical votes — known as a “confidence and supply” arrangement. The Conservatives struck one of these with a Northern Ireland party, the Democratic Unionists, after the 2017 election. When the results are known — and if a party clearly comes out on top — the head of that party visits Buckingham Palace to ask the queen for permission to form a new government and become the prime minister.  Britons do not vote directly on the prime minister but rather on a politician to represent their district, or constituency. Unlike the proportional systems used in several other European countries, where seats are apportioned according to the share each party receives of the overall vote, British elections are “first past the post”: Each voter has one vote, and the single candidate who gets the most votes in each constituency wins.  That means the winning candidate in any given constituency doesn’t need a majority of the votes,\xa0just more than the next person. And votes for a party nationwide don’t necessarily translate into seats: What counts is how many constituencies a party comes first in. It’s a system both praised and criticized for its ability to turn a plurality of the votes into a single-party government with a majority of parliamentary seats — sometimes, when opposition votes are badly split, a landslide majority. When Prime Minister Theresa May called a surprise early general election in 2017, the opinion polls gave her Conservative Party a lead of at least 20 percentage points on the Labour opposition. Mrs. May set out to expand the narrow parliamentary majority her party had won in 2015, to assure a smooth exit from the European Union.  But things didn’t go quite as planned. Mrs. May suffered a humiliating setback, with her Conservative Party losing its overall majority and instead forced to rely on the 10 votes of the Democratic Unionist Party to retain control in a minority government. The opposition Labour Party saw its support grow substantially, gaining 32 seats, driven in part by a spike in the youth vote. The Conservative Party has established a clear but potentially narrowing lead over the Labour Party in national polls, with Labour appearing to consolidate its support as the country headed into the final stage of the campaign.  On Tuesday, a highly regarded prediction model run by the polling company YouGov suggested the Conservatives were on course for a majority of 28. But analysts, including the ones behind that model, warn that predictions are perilous: 11 seats were decided by less than 100 votes at the last election, and dozens more by a few hundred votes, so a small shift in the right places could change the picture drastically. A recent study from the U.K. Political Studies Association found experts confident that the Conservatives would remain the largest party, but more skeptical of the polling that suggests they will regain an outright majority.  “This cautious prediction of no majority or a very small majority for the Conservatives by the experts may reflect lessons learnt from 2017, when the hung parliament surprised many,”  Joe Greenwood, a fellow at the London School of Economics, wrote of the study. “If the experts are right then 2019 may be a slightly less dramatic, but surprising nonetheless, rerun of 2017, and we are now only a matter of days from finding out.” Tactical voting sees individuals cast a ballot for a candidate they wouldn’t normally support to block another candidate from winning. It’s been a major discussion topic in this election campaign because Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system presents a puzzle for voters who see Brexit as the most important issue.  Those seeking to remain in the European Union are split between several parties. Pro-remain groups have attempted to unite voters behind the most promising pro-European candidate in each constituency — in England, usually from Labour or the Liberal Democrats — amid furious disputes about who has the best chance in certain seats. Pro-Brexit voters, however, appear to have largely united behind the Conservatives. The more radical Brexit Party decided not to stand candidates in Conservative-held constituencies to avoid splitting voters in favor of leaving the European Union between the two parties. ']",British voters will choose their next government on Thursday. But the country’s parliamentary system has a way of throwing up surprises. Here’s what to watch for.
Aung San Suu Kyi Defends Myanmar Against Rohingya Genocide Accusations,2019-12-11,By Marlise Simons and Hannah Beech,"['THE HAGUE — “Intercommunal violence.” Action against “insurgents or terrorists.” Possible — only possible — use of “disproportionate force.” But not genocide. A day after Daw Aung San Suu Kyi listened impassively to searing testimony about the horrors inflicted upon the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar, she took the podium on Wednesday at the United Nations’ highest court to defend her homeland against accusations of genocide, arguing that there had been no orchestrated campaign of persecution. Her statement at the International Court of Justice in The Hague capped a jarring turnabout, decades in the making, for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, from champion of human rights and democracy to apparent apologist for brutality. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her ramrod resistance to the former military dictatorship that held her under house arrest for 15 years. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not directly address the atrocities by Myanmar’s military and associated mobs that were described the day before — summary killings, babies thrown to their deaths, mass rapes, whole villages burned to cinders — all amply documented by the United Nations and human rights groups. Thousands of Rohingya have been killed and three quarters of a million driven into a squalid exile in neighboring Bangladesh. Instead, she insisted that what foreign observers have called an organized, years-long campaign of atrocities against the Rohingya has been exaggerated and misconstrued, whether out of malice or just ignorance. She did not even use the word “Rohingya,” adhering to her government’s stance that no such ethnic group exists. “Genocidal intent cannot be the only hypothesis,” she said on the second day of a three-day hearing, before launching into a litany of ways in which she said her government was trying to lift up the Rohingya from dire poverty.  The defense offered by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, her nation’s de facto civilian leader, was, by any measure, underwhelming, and it seemed unlikely to raise her much-diminished international reputation.  Instead, she went on the offensive against the outside world.  Presenting what many human rights experts have called some of the worst pogroms of this century as part of “cycles of inter-communal violence going back to the 1940s,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi chided foreigners for not having an adequate understanding of Myanmar’s complex ethnic and social history. While saying that it could “not be ruled out” that the Myanmar military may have used “disproportionate force,” or did not “distinguish clearly enough” between rebels and civilians, she criticized “impatient international actors.” “It would not be helpful for the international legal order if the impression takes hold that only resource-rich countries can conduct adequate domestic investigations and prosecutions,” she said. The global community has come to describe the forcible expulsion of Rohingya from Myanmar since 2017 as ethnic cleansing, even genocide. United Nations officials have said the nation’s military generals should be tried for the gravest crimes against humanity. In a landmark lawsuit filed by the West African nation Gambia on behalf of a group of 57 Islamic countries, Myanmar stands accused of genocide. Gambia’s case, which it began presenting to the court on Tuesday, relies on testimony from numerous witnesses and human-rights experts, along with reporting from a United Nations fact-finding mission on Myanmar.  On Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi — who could have left the task to others — presented her country’s rebuttal, giving a spirited defense of the same military brass who had locked her up. She has consistently declined to criticize the generals with whom she has shared power since her party won elections in 2015, although she has allowed that armed forces can be hard-pressed to admit to their own failings.  The violence that began on Aug. 25, 2017, she said, was set off by coordinated attacks on police and army posts by a Rohingya Muslim militant organization and amounted to operations used to “clear a locality of insurgents or terrorists.” “If war crimes have been committed,” she said, “they will be prosecuted within our military justice system.” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, personally, is not a defendant at the International Court of Justice, which rules on disputes between nations over questions of international law. Hours before she began speaking, U Myo Nyunt, the spokesman for her party, the National League for Democracy, dismissed the testimony presented to the court Tuesday as “he said, she said.”  “We have already prepared to rebut these accusations,” Mr. Myo Nyunt said. The United Nations report, he said, “is not complete because of a lack of evidence.”  Myanmar’s government prevented United Nations investigators from going to northern Rakhine, the center of the violence — a fact that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not acknowledge on Wednesday. She said a fact-finding group that she had assembled had collected the most comprehensive record of witness testimony.  Her aides have characterized as fake news various crimes against the Rohingya. Only two isolated cases of killings have been the subject of legal inquiries within Myanmar. Diplomats who have tried to bring up the situation in Rakhine with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi say she cut them off; two of them say she even refused any further one-on-one meetings.  Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations who was asked by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to participate in one of several commissions on Rakhine that she put together, quit in disgust last year after he said she “exploded” in anger at his criticism. “She might have hit me, she was so furious,” he recalled then. The great hall of the International Court of Justice, a polished space of chandeliers and stained glass windows, has been packed with diplomats, activists, lawyers and reporters vying for a glimpse of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. She did not react on Tuesday as Justice Minister Abubacarr M. Tambadou of Gambia opened his country’s case by urging the court to tell Myanmar “to stop this genocide of its own people.” “It is indeed sad for our generation that 75 years after humankind committed itself to the words ‘never again,’ another genocide is unfolding right before our eyes,” he said. “Yet we do nothing to stop it.” Paul Reichler, an American who is the lead lawyer for Gambia’s legal team, addressed the question of whether Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi bore personal responsibility for the deaths of thousands of Rohingya. Her defenders say she is constrained by the military’s continuing grip on some of the most important levers of power in Myanmar.  But Mr. Reichler showed the court a picture of large billboards that have appeared in Myanmar in recent days, showing her superimposed in front of three smiling generals with the caption: “We stand with you.” Mr. Myo Nyunt, the National League for Democracy spokesman, said that the billboards did not mean Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and the military were united. “It just means they are in the same cabinet,” he said. “This case is very delicate and we need to handle the problem gently.”  Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party is facing elections next year, and her attitude toward the Rohingya has broad support in Myanmar. “Unfortunately she has totally taken sides, and she is now whipping up nationalism simply to become more popular,” said U Maung Tun Khin, a Rohingya who traveled to The Hague from London to witness the hearings. Ma Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a youth activist in Myanmar, said support for the National League for Democracy had been flagging in the face of ethnic strife and a struggling economy, but people have rallied around the party over the genocide case. “We can see that the divided political forces inside Myanmar have united to face a lawsuit from a foreign country that is seen as a common enemy,” she  said. Rohingya Muslims have been persecuted for decades in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, gradually losing rights to education, health care and even citizenship. Half a million Rohingya still live in Rakhine, but they have been herded into internment camps or prevented from leaving their villages, even to farm or collect firewood.  Those who have fled to Bangladesh are crowded into the world’s largest refugee camp.  The purpose of this week’s hearing is for the court to decide whether to order measures to protect the Rohingya who remain in Myanmar. A United Nations rapporteur recently warned that “crimes with genocidal intent” were continuing and intensifying in Rakhine.  A ruling on the underlying allegation of genocide could take years. Another case against Myanmar, formerly called Burma, is working its way through another international court. Abdul Malik Mujahid, who heads Burma Task Force U.S.A., part of a coalition of Muslim groups, said he believed that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s presence at the court would backfire by giving renewed exposure to the continuing plight of the Rohingya.  “I’m sure she is doing a disservice to her government and her cause by showing up,” said Mr. Mujahid, an imam who traveled from Chicago to attend the hearing. “The world will pay attention to her, and also to the facts in a legal case that might otherwise get little attention. She is providing infamous star power to the case.” Marlise Simons reported from The Hague, and Hannah Beech from Bangkok.

Sanna Marin of Finland to Become World’s Youngest Prime Minister,2019-12-09,By Johanna Lemola and Megan Specia,"['HELSINKI, Finland — Sanna Marin, 34, is set to become the world’s youngest sitting prime minister when she is sworn in this week in Finland, after being elected to the position by her party late Sunday.  The country’s coalition government consists of five parties, four of which are led by women, with Ms. Marin now at the helm. Four of the women are under the age of 35, which Finnish political experts say is more significant, symbolic of the rise of a new generation of politicians in the Nordic nation, which has had strong female representation for decades. “The past week has been extraordinary,” she told reporters, according to Helsingin Sanomat, a leading Finnish newspaper. “Now is the time to look ahead. What is needed now is action beyond words to build trust from all government parties.” Formerly the country’s transportation minister, Ms. Marin was voted in by fellow lawmakers in her Social Democratic Party after a turbulent week in which Prime Minister Antti Rinne resigned over his handling of a postal workers strike.  Although Mr. Rinne will continue as head of the party, Parliament is expected to confirm Ms. Marin as prime minister as soon as Tuesday, depending on how quickly the other coalition parties name their ministers. Once sworn in, she will be Finland’s youngest prime minister to date and its third female prime minister.  Ms. Marin, a left-leaning liberal, has been a member of Parliament since 2015. She began her political career in 2012, when she was elected to the local council in the southern city of Tampere. Most recently she was minister of transportation and communications in Mr. Rinne’s government.  Serving as Mr. Rinne’s deputy when he took an extended sick leave earlier this year, she helped lead their party to a narrow win in national elections.  Alexander Stubb, who was Finland’s prime minister from 2014 to 2015, posted on Twitter that having a government led by women “shows that #Finland is a modern and progressive country.” “One day, gender will not matter in government,” he wrote. “Meanwhile pioneers.” Of the five women in leading ministerial positions in the coalition, four are under 35. Asked about her age after it was announced that she would be prime minister, Ms. Marin reiterated what she has said numerous times: Age doesn’t matter. “I have not actually ever thought about my age or my gender,” she said, according to the national news outlet YLE. “I think of the reasons I got into politics and those things for which we have won the trust of the electorate.”  She outlined her political ethos in a letter to fellow party members ahead of the decision on Sunday, asking for their support. She noted that she had benefited from the welfare state throughout her life, especially during “difficult times” and said that ensuring its strength was a priority for her. “I got to live a safe childhood, have an education and pursue my dreams,” she wrote. “Enabling it for everyone has driven me into politics.” While Ms. Marin’s new role has drawn attention globally, Anne Holli, a political science professor at the University of Helsinki, said it was unsurprising, in Finland where women’s representation in Parliament has been strong for decades. In the 1983 election, women held 30 percent of the seats. By the 2007 election, they made up more than 40 percent of lawmakers, and they make up 47 percent in the parliamentary term that began this year. “We have actually a very broad base of women in politics, and we have had a pretty equal situation in the political sphere for more than 35 years,” Ms. Holli said. “I think one can kind of expect this sooner or later.” She said the sudden attention to the young female lawmakers has been jarring. “Nobody has been calling me when there are young male party leaders,” she said.  Ms. Holli said it was the youth of Ms. Marin and her fellow government leaders that was unusual, rather than their gender. “It’s kind of a change of generations,” she said. Ms. Marin won the leadership vote by a small margin, and her skills will be put to the test immediately as the country heads into a season of labor negotiations with the potential for strikes. Her predecessor, Mr. Rinne, was ultimately forced out of office after he made comments about a plan to cut wages for postal workers and his coalition partner, the Center Party, said it had lost confidence in him. Despite his resignation, the coalition’s parties will remain unaltered: Ms. Marin’s Social Democratic Party as Finland’s biggest, the Center Party, the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s Party of Finland.  The Social Democratic Party will vote at its convention next June to determine whether Mr. Rinne will continue to lead the party or whether Ms. Marin or someone else will formally take over. Many analysts say Ms. Marin is likely to win the contest for party leadership.  The coalition government under Ms. Marin is expected to continue prioritizing job creation and ambitious climate goals, seeking to render Finland carbon neutral by 2035. Tuomas Yla-Anttila, an associate professor of political science at the University of Helsinki said that Ms. Marin’s appointment as prime minister has symbolic value in the country, but is also a reflection of strides in gender equality.  “For a long time we had the situation in Finland where there were only men, now there are women, sometimes it goes the other way round,” he said, pointing to the all-female government leadership.  He said Ms. Marin’s youth likely helped her win the support of the troubled Social Democratic Party as it looks to reform and move away from the politics of Mr. Rinne. In Finland, he added, her age was a more important political factor than her sex. “The party surely wanted a younger prime minister,” he said. “Her young age is more important than being a woman. She represents a new generation of politicians.” Jenni Karimaki, a senior researcher at the Center for Parliamentary Studies at the University of Turku, said that in many ways Ms. Marin was a natural choice. She is the first deputy of the party and has served as a government minister, positions that traditionally have been springboards to the prime minister’s office.  “There is demand at the moment for young women in key positions,” Ms. Karimaki said, and pointed to the fact that many other young, female politicians won office in April’s national election. Ms. Karimaki said Ms. Marin also symbolized the new start that the Social Democrats have been looking for and represented “a strengthening of representative democracy.” “Now the picture is changing of what kind of people can bear high-level political responsibility,” she said. Johanna Lemola reported from Helsinki, and Megan Specia from London. ']","At 34, Ms. Marin will head a coalition made up of five parties, in a government led by women. "
India Steps Toward Making Naturalization Harder for Muslims,2019-12-09,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj,"['HYDERABAD, India — India took a major step toward the official marginalization of Muslims on Tuesday as one house of Parliament passed a bill that would establish a religious test for migrants who want to become citizens, solidifying Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist agenda.  The measure would give migrants of all of South Asia’s major religions a clear path to Indian citizenship — except Islam. It is the most significant move yet to profoundly alter India’s secular nature enshrined by its founding leaders when the country gained independence in 1947.  The bill passed in the lower house, the Lok Sabha, a few minutes after midnight, following a few hours of debate. The vote was 311 to 80. The measure now moves to the upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where Mr. Modi seems to have enough allies that most analysts predict it will soon become law.  Muslim Indians are deeply unsettled. They see the new measure, called the Citizenship Amendment Bill, as the first step by the governing party to make second-class citizens of India’s 200 million Muslims, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, and render many of them stateless. [Update: Protests spread across India over divisive citizenship law.] “We are heading toward totalitarianism, a fascist state,” said Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim lawmaker, who on Monday dramatically tore up a copy of the bill while giving a speech in Parliament. “We are making India a theocratic country.” The legislation goes hand in hand with a contentious program that began in the northeastern state of Assam this year, in which all 33 million residents of the state had to prove, with documentary evidence, that they or their ancestors were Indian citizens. Approximately two million people — many of them Muslims, and many of them lifelong residents of India — were left off the state’s citizenship rolls after that exercise.  Now, Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., is hoping to expand that kind of citizenship test to other states. And the new legislation would become a guiding principle for who could hope to call themselves Indians. Mr. Modi and his party are deeply rooted in an ideology that sees India as a Hindu nation. And since the B.J.P.’s landslide re-election win in May, Mr. Modi’s administration has celebrated one Hindu nationalist victory after another, each a demoralizing drumbeat for Muslims.  First came the Assam citizenship tests. Then Mr. Modi stripped away autonomy and statehood for Kashmir, which used to be India’s only Muslim-majority state. And last month, Hindu fundamentalists scored a big court victory allowing them to build a new temple over the ruins of a demolished mosque in the flash point city of Ayodhya.  With the new citizenship bill, Mr. Modi’s party says it is simply trying to protect persecuted Hindus, Buddhists and Christians (and members of a few smaller religions) who migrate from predominantly Muslim countries such as Pakistan or Afghanistan. But the legislation would also make it easier to incarcerate and deport Muslim residents, even those whose families have been in India for generations, if they cannot produce proof of citizenship.  Under Mr. Modi’s leadership, anti-Muslim sentiment has become blatantly more mainstream and public. Intimidation and attacks against Muslim communities have increased in recent years. And overt displays of Hindu piety and nationalism have become central in pop culture and politics. Mr. Modi’s fellow lawmakers in the B.J.P. are unapologetic about their pro-Hindu position.  “There are Muslim countries, there are Jew countries, everybody has their own identity. And we are a billion-plus, right? We must have one identity,” said Ravi Kishan, a famous action-film hero and member of Parliament who is a central supporter of the citizenship legislation.  When asked if he was trying to turn India into a Hindu nation, he laughed. “India has always been a Hindu nation,” he said. “The Muslims also are Hindus.” (This is a common Hindu nationalist belief: that India’s Muslims are relatively recent converts, even though Islam arrived in India hundreds of years ago.) Even before lawmakers in the Lok Sabha voted,  protests were breaking out.  In Assam, where the citizenship program began last summer, thousands of people have marched in the streets, hoisting placards and torches and shouting out their opposition to the bill.  People are talking of mass fasts and boycotts of schools and markets. On Monday, some hanged effigies of Mr. Modi and his right-hand man, Amit Shah, the home minister.  The leaders of the opposition Indian National Congress party are trying to paint the bill as a danger to India’s democracy. After India won its independence, its founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru among them, made a clear decision: Even though the country was 80 percent Hindu, it would not be an officially Hindu nation. Minorities, especially Muslims, would be treated equally. Rahul Gandhi, a party leader and great-grandson of Mr. Nehru, said, “India belongs to everybody — all communities, all religions, all cultures.” Shashi Tharoor, the party’s intellectual heavyweight, called the bill an “all-out assault on the very idea of India.” But the Congress party is at a low point in its 100-year-plus history. And Mr. Modi’s party has the numbers: With allies, it controls nearly two-thirds of the seats in the lower house.  Some of Mr. Modi’s critics believe the bill is serving to distract the public from another pressing issue: the economy. For the first time in decades, India’s economy is slowing significantly. It is still huge, but several big industries, like car and motorcycle manufacturing, have seen sales plummet like never before.  “The economy is in tatters,” said Aman Wadud, a human rights lawyer in Assam. The bill, he said, was “the only issue left to polarize the country and distract people.” But forging India into an overtly Hindu nation has been a core goal of Mr. Modi’s party and of the R.S.S., a right-wing volunteer group whose ranks Mr. Modi rose up through and which provides him a backbone of support. And India’s recent moves in Kashmir, along with the Ayodhya temple ruling and the Assam citizenship tests, have been hugely popular with the prime minister’s base. Earlier this year, Mr. Modi’s government tried to push similar citizenship legislation. The bill sailed through the lower house but stalled after many politicians in Assam said they did not like the religious dimension the B.J.P. was injecting — or the possibility that a large number of Hindu Bengalis would be made citizens and would be able to legally acquire land in Assam. The bill gathered new momentum this fall, after the citizenship test in Assam. Assam has witnessed waves of migration over the years, and many of those people whose citizenship was being questioned were migrants, both Hindus and Muslims, from neighboring Bangladesh.  Mr. Shah, the home minister and architect of the B.J.P.’s recent political victories, promised to protect the Hindus and other non-Muslims. He has called illegal migrants from Bangladesh “termites,” and along with his other statements made clear that Muslims were his target. Mr. Shah has also promised to impose the citizenship test from Assam on the entire country.  The citizenship bill is a piece of the campaign to identify and deport Muslims who have been living in India for years, critics of the bill say. It lays out a path to Indian citizenship for migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan if they can prove they have been in India for at least five years and ascribe to the specified religions.  To overcome the resistance from politicians in Assam, who do not want Hindu or Muslim migrants taking their land, the new version of the bill carves out special protections for areas predominated by indigenous people. Mr. Modi’s supporters employ a certain logic when defending the bill’s exclusion of Muslims. They say Muslims are not persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan, which is mostly true. They also say that when India and Pakistan were granted independence in 1947, the British carved out Pakistan as a haven for Muslims, while India remained predominantly Hindu. To them, the extension of that process is to ask illegal Muslims migrants to leave India and seek refuge in neighboring, mainly Muslim nations. Article 25 of the Indian Constitution says, “All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.” Given that, many opponents of the bill say the citizenship legislation is patently unconstitutional. But the Hindu nationalists have an answer for that, as well. “We are not talking about citizens,” said Ramesh Shinde, a spokesman for the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, a Hindu organization that is considered a far-right group. “We are talking about migrants.” Both sides agree on one thing: The bill could have far-reaching consequences.  The Indian government is already racing to build an enormous network of prisons to house thousands of migrants. If immigration law is applied selectively, Hindu migrants who are swept up in raids may be released and allowed to apply for citizenship, while Muslim migrants could instead be sent to detention camps, opponents say. “In every state, Muslims are running around for papers,” said Mr. Wadud, the human rights lawyer in Assam. “An environment of fear has been created.” Mr. Kishan, the action hero turned politician, said he would next push to change India’s name to Bharat, the traditional Hindi word for India. But he said that he was not anti-Muslim, and that Muslims living in India legally had nothing to fear.  “How can I be anti-Muslim? My staff in Mumbai is Muslim,” he said.  “Hindus and Muslims in India are like this,” he said, interlacing his fingers. “But,” he added with a big smile, “I love Hindus.” Jeffrey Gettleman reported from Hyderabad, India, and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.

"After Eruption in New Zealand, 5 Dead, 8 Missing and ‘No Signs of Life’",2019-12-09,By Jamie Tarabay and Damien Cave,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — They had taken boats to a desolate island to get a glimpse of a natural wonder, but when the White Island volcano erupted on Monday,  a scene of stunning beauty suddenly turned into a deadly trap.  At least five people were killed when the volcano erupted on the island  off the eastern coast of New Zealand, eight were still missing and 31 remained hospitalized with burns and other injuries. Three more people had been hospitalized and released.  Reconnaissance flights over the area have found no signs of life. “To those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your unfathomable grief at this moment in time and in your sorrow,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a news conference in Whakatane, a coastal community near the volcano. “Our duty,” she added, “is to return loved ones.” The New Zealand authorities said a criminal investigation had been opened in the aftermath of the eruption, in addition to a formal inquiry by the country’s work safety commission. A New Zealand deputy police commissioner, John Tims, said emergency personnel were still trying to gain access to the island, but were being held up by the risk of further eruptions and rough wind conditions that had grounded an attempt to get drones above the island for reconnaissance. “We understand the desire from the locals and the loved ones to remove their family from the island but we are working round the clock, we are working hard, and we understand what we need to do for friends and family,” he said. The challenge of  recovery and the scale of the disaster caused by the volcano — which has been promoted for decades as live and active but relatively safe to visit — played out overnight and into Tuesday morning as officials described dangerous helicopter flights to look for survivors and attempts to treat the wounded.  Among the missing or injured were tourists from Australia, China, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States, along with tour operators from New Zealand.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said in a statement that 24 Australians had been on White Island,  13 of whom are hospitalized. As many as three of the five confirmed dead are Australian, as are many of the missing. There were also nine Americans on the island on Monday. On Tuesday morning, relatives gathered at the Port of Tauranga where two large cruise ships sat docked, as officials interviewed people aboard.  On the Ovation of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean ship from which several groups of tourists went to the volcano just before it erupted, no one was being allowed to disembark.  Officials said 47 people were on White Island when it erupted. Dozens more were cruising the area in smaller boats. “It looked like a nuclear bomb going off,” said one witness who spoke to Radio New Zealand.  Others described a slowly emerging cloud of smoke and ash, seen from the water, and the suddenly horrifying realization that some people were still there.  “This is so hard to believe,” said Michael Schade, a visitor from San Francisco, who posted photos and video of his group’s departure from White Island moments after the eruption. “Our whole tour group were literally standing at the edge of the main crater not 30 minutes before.”  Twenty-three people, including the five dead, were evacuated on Monday, said Mr. Tims,  the deputy police commissioner.  Among the missing are people who were seen on a webcam exploring the upper reaches of the volcano’s crater just before the eruption at 2:11 p.m. local time, Reuters reported.  Ms. Ardern said that the tourists on White Island seemed to have had little time to seek shelter before the “very significant” eruption occurred.  The island, also known as Whakaari, is privately owned and is typically visited by thousands of tourists every year, many of them drawn by promotions for “New Zealand’s most active volcano.” For Whakatane, a town of about 20,000 that’s a hub for White Island tours, the volcano’s appeal to visitors is an important part of the local economy. “The whole tourist industry revolves around the island,” said Phil van Dusschoten, a retired police officer who now runs a company that operates dive and fishing trips.  “It’s a somber atmosphere,” he said in a telephone interview on Tuesday morning, adding that the smell of sulfur was still wafting in the air. Mr. van Dusschoten said he was working on his boat when he saw the 12,000-foot tall ash clouds billowing from White Island. He said he later saw a busload of people, all of whom were shirtless, who had likely been rescued from the island. “For the last 30 plus years, we’ve operated without incident, allowing tens of thousands of tourists to visit the volcano,” he said. “It’s very sad.” On Monday, enveloped in the searing ash, White Island was too dangerous for emergency workers to reach. Mr. Tims told an afternoon news conference there had been no communication with anyone still on the island. Ash and smoke made it difficult for cameras pointed toward the volcano to see anyone on the island. “We know the urgency to go back to the island,” he told reporters. Ms. Ardern traveled Monday to Whakatane. “I know that there will be a huge amount of anxiety for those who had loved ones on the island at the time,” she said.  Tourists from the Royal Caribbean cruise ship were among those who visited the island on Monday, the company said, but the company did not say how many went or address their fate. Mr. Tims, the police commissioner, said the police were scheduled to receive a list of those who had gone to the island. A Royal Caribbean spokesman, Jonathon Fishman, said the company was “working together with local authorities, and providing all the help and care we can to our guests and their families, including offering medical resources and counseling.”  The eruption was reported to have occurred at 2:11 p.m. local time.  Directly after the eruption, GeoNet, the agency that monitors geological activity in New Zealand, raised its volcanic alert level to four. By about 4.30 p.m., it was decreased to Level 3, with the agency noting there was no further escalation in volcanic activity. The police have established a no-fly zone around the island and warned people living near areas that might be affected by falling ash to remain indoors and listen to the radio or television for news updates. Ash fall can contain jagged particles of abrasive rock or natural glass, and anyone exposed to it was advised to wear a dust mask or use a cloth handkerchief to cover their noses and mouths and wear goggles to protect their eyes.  Ken Gledhill, from the research institute GNS Science, likened the eruption to the volcano “clearing its throat,” and said that while it looked like it had quietened down, the authorities could not be certain there would not be another eruption within the next 24 hours. The volcano is New Zealand’s most active.  People were allowed to visit the island even after GeoNet had earlier issued bulletins warning of “moderate volcanic unrest” with “substantial gas, steam and mud bursts” observed at the crater lake.  “We’ve issued two or three bulletins in the last few weeks about the increase in activity,” Brad Scott, a GeoNet volcanologist, said in an interview.  He said that even though the volcano has been erupting since 2011, tourists have been undeterred, with visits to the island dating to the late 1800s. He said the agency passed its information on the volcano’s activity to tour operators and the police, but tourists make their own decisions about whether to visit the island. “The weather has traditionally been the only thing that has stopped visitors,” he said, noting that the volcano sits in the open ocean and people wanting to reach it have to contend with rough waters to make the journey. Royal Caribbean Cruises did not say whether it had known of the warnings about the volcanic activity.  The last time there was a large number of fatalities on White Island had nothing to do with a volcanic eruption. In 1914, part of a crater wall collapsed, causing a landslide and killing 10 men mining sulfur. Sasha Borissenko contributed reporting from Mount Maunganui, New Zealand. Emily S.

A Sick U.K. Boy’s Story Was True. But False Posts Followed.,2019-12-10,By Adam Satariano,"['LONDON — The photo of a sick 4-year-old boy lying on the floor of an overcrowded hospital in Yorkshire because there were no beds available for him sent a jolt through the British election.  A local newspaper, the Yorkshire Evening Post, had published a story about the episode on Sunday after the boy’s mother reached out to share her outrage about the experience. The hospital, Leeds General Infirmary, confirmed that the incident had indeed happened, and issued an official apology.  Then on Monday, three days before Britain’s general election, the story was splashed on the front page of The Daily Mirror, a left-leaning tabloid, to criticize the health care policies of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party. Later on Monday, Mr. Johnson was shown the photo in an awkward television interview with ITV that went viral online.  It all seemed like a fairly normal cycle of political outrage.  But since Monday evening, journalists and researchers have tracked what appears to be a social media campaign to discredit the boy’s family. A message was shared widely on Facebook and Twitter from somebody claiming to know a nurse at the hospital who said the mother had staged the photo. “Very interesting,” the message reads. “A good friend of mine is a senior nursing sister at Leeds Hospital.” It then goes on to say that the mother had deliberately put the boy on the floor.  It is not clear how widely the false claims were seen, especially because Facebook does not provide a way to track messages posted inside private accounts and groups. Many people posted the message as a screen shot, which also cannot be discovered through a word search. Among those sharing the message were public figures including Allison Pearson, a columnist for The Telegraph, and Kevin Pietersen, a retired cricket star.  The origins of the false information about the boy are murky. According to First Draft, a London-based group that tracks disinformation, the first known post was made on Facebook.  When The Guardian newspaper reached the woman thought to have written the post, she said her account had been hacked.  She offered a different account when contacted by the BBC, however, saying the account had not been hacked and that she had copied a post written by somebody else.  Efforts to reach the woman at what is believed to be her office were unsuccessful.  “It is clearly an attempt to disrupt and mislead the electoral process in the days before polling,” said Alastair Reid, digital editor at First Draft. “This is, without evidence, casting aspersions on a photo to cause further discord and distrust and division among social media users and voters.”  The episode highlights how questionable material can spread at the speed of a click, raising further concerns about the role of social media in elections. In this cycle of British campaigning, internet manipulation tactics have gone mainstream, adopted even by the political parties and candidates themselves, particularly the Conservative Party and Mr. Johnson.  At the Yorkshire Evening Post, the experience has been deflating. The reporter who wrote the initial story, Daniel Sheridan, followed standard journalistic techniques to confirm the accuracy of the information, including getting the statement from the hospital.  By Monday night, James Mitchinson, the editor who oversees the newsroom, said he had started to get messages from readers questioning the authenticity of the story, based on what they had read online. One woman wrote to him to say that she would no longer read the newspaper even though she had been a subscriber for many years.  He wrote back to the woman, who he said had been “unfairly manipulated and discombobulated by cynical social media messaging driven by dark forces,” and posted his response on social media.  In an interview, Mr. Mitchinson said, “I’ve never experienced anything quite like this where there is a coordinated, relentless attacking of the message.”  “We’re living in strange times,” he added, “where for whatever reason people are drawn to social media messages and come to trust them more than they trust their local newspaper who they have had a trusted relationship with probably all their lives.” By Tuesday night, the paper had published its own response, with a blazing headline on the front page: “Don’t Be Fooled By Fake News.” ']",An accurate story about an overcrowded hospital quickly became an election issue in Britain. Then came disinformation on social media. 
Duterte Says Martial Law in Southern Philippines Will End This Month,2019-12-10,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte announced on Tuesday that military rule in the southern Philippines would soon end, two and a half years after he imposed it in response to a rebellion by Islamic State militants in the city of Marawi. The Philippine military and police recommended the move last week, saying that the security situation on the southern island of Mindanao, which includes Marawi, had improved. Salvador Panelo, Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, said martial law on the island — which empowers the military to carry out warrantless arrests and set up checkpoints, among other powers — would expire on Dec. 31. Mr. Panelo said the president was confident in “the capability of our security forces in maintaining the peace and security of Mindanao without extending martial law.” He added, “The people of Mindanao are assured that any incipient major threat in the region would be nipped in the bud.” Hundreds of Islamist fighters from Southeast Asia and the Middle East took over Marawi in May 2017, with the goal of turning that city of 200,000 people into the center of an Islamic caliphate. The Philippines is mostly Catholic, but Mindanao has a substantial Muslim population. Intense battles raged in Marawi for months, with the American and Australian militaries providing intelligence support to Philippine forces. More than 1,000 people were killed, including Isnilon Hapilon — who was considered the Islamic State’s leader in Southeast Asia — and his key lieutenants.  The government declared victory in October, but it extended martial law at the end of 2017 and again a year later, saying that militants still posed a threat. A number of foreign militants are believed to have escaped the fighting in Marawi and fled to other restive parts of the southern Philippines, including Jolo island. Two Indonesian suicide bombers killed 23 people at a Catholic church on Jolo in January. On Saturday, a soldier and four Filipino militants linked to the Islamic State were killed in a gun battle on Jolo. The military said troops had been hunting a faction of the Abu Sayyaf militant group led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who intelligence officials believe succeeded Mr. Hapilon as the Islamic State’s leader in the Philippines. Various armed groups have been active in the southern Philippines for decades.  Rights groups had objected to the continuing use of martial law, warning that it eroded constitutional values and noting that Mr. Duterte had raised the possibility of imposing it throughout the country. Drieza Abato Lininding, who became a rights activist after losing his home in the Marawi fighting, welcomed the presidential announcement on Tuesday. “We’ve been consistent in our appeals in the past that martial law is not necessary in the fight against extremist groups,” he said. He said he hoped the military would immediately lift a curfew imposed in Marawi and nearby areas, saying it would help to spur economic recovery by safeguarding the freedom of movement. “Marawi under martial law is like living in an internment camp, where people are forced to obey even if what they do is against their will,” Mr. Lininding said.']","The president imposed military rule on the island of Mindanao two and a half years ago, after an Islamist rebellion in the city of Marawi."
Czech Hospital Shooting Leaves at Least 6 Dead,2019-12-10,By Elian Peltier,"['A gunman killed six people on Tuesday after opening fire at close range in a hospital waiting room in the eastern Czech city of Ostrava, and a man who was believed to be responsible for the relatively rare instance of gun violence in the country killed himself hours later as the police closed in, the authorities said. The police said on Twitter that several hours after the shooting at University Hospital in Ostrava, a 42-year-old man who had been driving a silver-gray Renault Laguna shot himself in the head after officers fired at his vehicle.  The shooting was the deadliest in the country since 2015, when a gunman killed eight people at a restaurant in Uhersky Brod, about 180 miles southeast of Prague.  Prime Minister Andrej Babis called the attack in Ostrava, near the border with Poland, a “great tragedy,” though much remained unclear, including the identity of the gunman and his motive.  The attacker walked into the hospital Tuesday morning and stayed for a while in the waiting room before he started shooting, according to Czech media. Four men and two women were killed, the hospital director, Jiri Havrlant, told reporters. At least two people were seriously wounded in the shooting, the authorities said.  The Associated Press reported that the clinic in Ostrava, about 220 miles east of Prague, was evacuated. The police also tightened security across the country. Gun-related deaths are rare in Czech Republic, and gun ownership is comparatively low among European countries, but the nation has been an outlier on the Continent because of its efforts to loosen gun laws. The European Union introduced tighter controls on firearms two years after a series of coordinated assaults by Islamist extremists in Paris in 2015 left 131 people dead, including restrictions on the private use of semiautomatic rifles — a move the Czech Republic fought in court.  The Czech Republic filed a lawsuit, arguing that legally held weapons had no connection with the fight against terrorism, and that the controls would discriminate against hunters. The Czech Parliament later approved legislation that put gun owners’ rights in the national Constitution. The Czech Republic lost the legal battle last week, when the European Union’s top court dismissed its challenge. It was unclear what type of firearm the attacker used on Tuesday, but the head of the regional police department said that the weapon was illegally held and that the suspect had a record for minor crimes. The suspect was a construction technician, according to his employer, Ales Zygula, who told the Czech public radio broadcaster that the man had “convinced himself that he was seriously ill and that nobody wanted to treat him.”  Mr. Zygula added that his employee had not been to work for the past month and that he had taken a sick leave in recent weeks. The suspect died about half an hour after he shot himself, the interior minister, Jan Hamacek, said. He added that a manhunt for the suspect had included two helicopters. “I’d like to assure the public that there’s no danger anymore,” Mr. Hamacek said.

"In Myanmar Army’s Corner, Aung San Suu Kyi Will Defend It in Rohingya Genocide Case",2019-12-10,By Hannah Beech and Saw Nang,"['BANGKOK — She could have stayed home. Nobody is forcing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi — she of the Nobel Peace Prize and fragrant flowers in her hair — to stride into the International Court of Justice on Tuesday at The Hague, where she will lead Myanmar’s defense against accusations of genocide. After all, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi spent decades battling the same military generals accused of perpetrating mass atrocities against Myanmar’s minority Rohingya Muslims. Just a few years ago, the onetime democracy activist, who serves as Myanmar’s foreign minister and de facto civilian leader, visited the halls of power in Western Europe to preach the virtues of nonviolent resistance against a military dictatorship. This time, her mission is very different. From Tuesday to Thursday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi will represent Myanmar in public hearings at the International Court of Justice, where the country is being accused of trying to “destroy the Rohingya as a group, in whole or in part, by the use of mass murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as the systematic destruction by fire of their villages, often with inhabitants locked inside burning houses.” The three days of public hearings at The Hague, which opened on Tuesday, will not address the merits of the case, which was brought by Gambia on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation.  Instead, the court proceedings are focused on whether the court should issue urgent orders to protect the half a million Rohingya still living in Myanmar. The court could issue such “provisional measures” in a matter of days, long before the international legal system rules on the charge of genocide, a process that could take years. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, dressed in black, sat motionless in the front row on Tuesday, facing 17 judges of the United Nations’ highest court, as lawyers for Gambia began making their case that hundreds of thousands of Rohingya still in Myanmar urgently needed protection.  Philippe Sands, a specialist in international law who is a member of Gambia’s legal team, told the judges that the Rohingya remained the targets of “ongoing genocide” and were vulnerable to more atrocities to come.  “You are called upon to act now,” he said. “This court is the ultimate guardian of the Genocide Convention,” he told the court. “It is on you that the eyes of the world are turned.” For many outside Myanmar, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s evolution from imprisoned opposition leader to apologist for some of this century’s worst ethnic pogroms is a cautionary tale of how power corrupts. But her turn as the generals’ protector has only cemented her popularity at home, where her party, the National League for Democracy, faces elections next year. “Daw Aung San Suu Kyi always handles problems with love,” said U Saw Phoe Kwar, a well-known reggae singer and peace activist in Myanmar. “Everyone should be united as she faces the problem at The Hague.” For days, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s fans have gathered across Myanmar for rallies of support.  To them, the expulsion of Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine State in far western Myanmar, a campaign so vicious that United Nations officials have said that it had genocidal intent, simply did not happen. “Western opinion seems to be against Myanmar in the Rakhine case because the information they get from the international news has led to a misunderstanding,” said U Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy. “They need to know more about the real situation on the ground and the history of the country.” Mr. Myo Nyunt said no mass atrocities had taken place against the Rohingya, apart from isolated bouts of killings in two villages. Instead, he said that the international community has ignored the deaths of dozens of Hindus in Rakhine State at the hands of what the Myanmar authorities say were Rohingya insurgents. International human rights groups estimate that thousands of Rohingya have been massacred by the military and mobs of Buddhist villagers since 2017.  “We are trying our best not to harm anyone in the country just because of their religion,” Mr. Myo Nyunt said. In Myanmar, the international effort to punish those responsible is viewed by many as a plot by oil-rich sheikhs to upend a peaceful Buddhist nation. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s supporters hope that she, with her Oxford University pedigree and crisp English, can clear up any confusion and persuade the judges at the International Court of Justice to reject the case against Myanmar, just as she once rallied foreign resistance to the country’s repressive military junta. “There is no one better than Aung San Suu Kyi in terms of wisdom and experience,” said U So Bhi Ta, a Buddhist monk in the city of Mandalay. “I believe that she will bring the real news to overcome the fake news from the Western media,” he added. Since becoming the de facto civilian leader of Myanmar after the 2015 elections, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has avoided criticizing the generals for an orchestrated campaign of violence that has compelled more than three quarters of a million Rohingya to flee for neighboring Bangladesh since 2017. She has blamed Muslim “terrorists” and a “huge iceberg of misinformation” for the Rohingya crisis. Her office’s social media feeds have labeled the military’s sexual violence against Rohingya women as “fake rape.” The Rohingya are considered illegal immigrants by most people in Myanmar, formerly called Burma. Most have been rendered stateless, even though their homes are in Rakhine. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s surprise announcement last month that she would lead the team of lawyers presenting Myanmar’s case at The Hague unleashed a frenzy of public displays of support back home: billboards urging her luck in Europe, contemporary art exhibits dedicated to her heroism, blessings from Buddhist monks who see her as a defender of a faith besieged by Islam. Her boost in popularity is well timed for the National League for Democracy, facing its first re-election campaign since its landslide victory four years ago. Economic overhauls have stalled. Fighting with various ethnic groups has flared in the nation’s borderlands. Representatives of the Shan ethnic group, which is battling Myanmar’s military in the north, released a statement on Monday saying that they “strongly support the international legal cases being brought against Burma’s military leaders, who have authorized atrocities against the country’s ethnic peoples for decades with impunity.” “Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s trip to The Hague is definitely related to the 2020 election,” said Khun Gamani, a social researcher. “I think she is desperate to get the Burmese Army’s recognition and deference.” “This aggressive populism will render sustainable peace and reconciliation inside Myanmar even more impossible,” said Sawangwongse Yawnghwe, an artist and activist whose grandfather was the country’s first president. “It’s all for short-term gain and winning next year’s election, but the impact of what her government is doing now will be felt for generations to come.” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s supporters said that she was not necessarily walking in lock step with the nation’s military, known as the Tatmadaw. Myanmar’s delicate power-sharing structure means that any contrary move by the pro-democracy camp could push the military further out of the barracks, they said. “She is not going to The Hague because she is on the same side as the Tatmadaw,” said Mr. Myo Nyunt, the National League for Democracy spokesman. “It’s more like a parent taking responsibility for his or her kid’s problems.” But critics said that had Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi used her moral eloquence to defend persecuted ethnic minorities, virulent hatred of the Rohingya in Myanmar would not have become as acceptable as it now is. “The military and Aung San Suu Kyi’s denials are not only crude attempts to cover up atrocities but the ugly rhetoric does harm to survivors,” said Matthew Smith, a co-founder of Fortify Rights, an advocacy group. “It contributes to the destruction as a group. This is all by design.” Most Rohingya remaining in Myanmar are interned in camps or confined to their villages, without access to basic services. In its court submissions, Gambia said this population faced “grave danger of further genocidal acts.” Elsewhere, the Rohingya who now live in the largest refugee settlement in the world, a sprawl of mud and shacks in Bangladesh, have been told that their encampments will soon be enclosed by barbed-wire fencing. Internet access has slowed since local telecommunications firms were ordered by the Bangladeshi government not to provide coverage to those without proper papers. In their flimsy shelters, the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh can do little but depend on judicial deliberations a continent away. “We are quite sure that Aung San Suu Kyi will not tell the truth at the court and will try to protect herself and the military,” said Alam Shah, a Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh. “We trust the international lawyers and we hope they will not join hands with the perpetrators.” Hannah Beech reported from Bangkok, and Saw Nang from Mandalay, Myanmar.

"With Many Dents to Its Image, Nobel Peace Prize Is Hit With a Few More",2019-12-11,By Rick Gladstone,"['[View the latest updates to the 2020 Nobel Prize winners list.] The Nobel Peace Prize has long been contentious, beginning with its origins in the will of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century inventor of dynamite. But it is extraordinary that two winners are almost simultaneously battling accusations of behavior that is widely regarded as antithetical to the spirit and purpose of the award, first given in 1901.  On Wednesday, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar leader who won the prize in 1991, appeared before the International Court of Justice and denied accusations that her government had committed genocide against the Rohingya minority. Her defense of Myanmar at the court was a jarring contrast to her onetime identity as an intrepid  champion of human rights and democracy. And on Tuesday, the 2019 winner, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia, facing accusations of a heavy-handed crackdown on political protests, skipped a news conference after his acceptance speech. In some years, critics have questioned the worthiness of winners without marquee accomplishments — like the 2012 award to the European Union, for example, or the 2009 award to President Barack Obama, just months into his first term.  In other instances — perhaps most famously the 1973 award to Henry A. Kissinger and his North Vietnamese counterpart, Le Duc Tho, as the Vietnam War was still raging — the track records of winners have been ridiculed. (The singer Tom Lehrer famously said that the choice of Mr. Kissinger had rendered political satire obsolete.) In the case of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, some critics have suggested that the criteria for selecting winners should be reassessed — including the possibility that the honor could be rescinded. Such questions are inherent to the prize regardless who is chosen, said Dr. Richard B. Gunderman, a professor  at Indiana University who has written about the prize’s history.  “The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize has always been fraught with peril, subject to the current drift of public opinion and political and nationalistic motives and prejudices,” Dr. Gunderman said.  “Like all human judgments, the Nobel committee’s decisions are prone to error,” he said. “It should do the best it can and then live with the consequences.”  Here are some other notably contentious Nobel Peace Prize nominees and winners: Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939 by a member of Sweden’s Parliament, E.G.C. Brandt, who apparently meant it as a satire against the leader of Nazi Germany, and never intended the choice to be seriously considered. But the nomination created such outrage that it was quickly withdrawn.  Joseph Stalin, Hitler’s nemesis and the leader of the Soviet Communist Party, was nominated twice — in 1945 and 1948 — for his efforts to end World War II. Despite Stalin’s murderous purges and pogroms, those nominations were taken in earnest.  The American statesmen Cordell Hull won in 1945 for his role in establishing the United Nations. Six years earlier, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s secretary of state, he took steps that led Roosevelt to deny permission for 950 Jewish refugees aboard the liner St. Louis, fleeing Nazi persecution, to seek asylum in the United States.  Many of the passengers on the trip, known as the Voyage of the Damned, later died in the Holocaust. The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization shared the 1994 prize with the Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for the Oslo Accords, still widely regarded as the basis for a peace process. But many critics assailed the choice of Mr. Arafat because of his role in acts of terrorism against Israelis. The 1973 prize was awarded to Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnam statesman Le Duc Tho for having negotiated a cease-fire in the Vietnam War.  Many critics of the war — which would not be over for two more years — ridiculed the choice of Mr. Kissinger, and his Vietnamese counterpart refused to accept the award on grounds that the United States had violated the cease-fire.  An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s Nobel Peace Prize. She received it in 1991, not 1994.']","Myanmar’s onetime champion of democracy and Ethiopia’s prime minister join a roster of figures who, one way or another, have given the Nobel Peace Prize a contentious image.

"Who Keeps Europe’s Farm Billions Flowing? Often, Those Who Benefit",2019-12-11,By Matt Apuzzo and Selam Gebrekidan,"['BRUSSELS — One morning this spring, lawmakers crowded into a committee room filled with staffers, lobbyists and environmentalists to vote on a flurry of bills that would set the course for the European Union’s $65-billion-a-year farm policy. For critics of the subsidy system, one item was of special interest. It was known as the “Babis Amendment,” after Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist and prime minister of the Czech Republic. It was designed to prohibit politicians who hand out European Union farm subsidies from receiving the funds themselves. Mr. Babis is Exhibit A of how the system benefits the wealthy and connected. His government shapes agricultural subsidy policies in the Czech Republic. It also gave $42 million in European subsidies last year to his domestic companies, according to a New York Times analysis. His holdings in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia received another $7 million. “The vote is open,” the agricultural committee chairman declared.  Eleven seconds passed.  Then the chairman simply said: “Rejected.” Nobody read the proposal aloud. There was no debate. And nobody mentioned one relevant fact: that half of the 46 committee members had ties to the farm industry. Several lawmakers received thousands of dollars in subsidies. The Babis Amendment could have jeopardized their money, too.  The European Union’s farm program is one of the largest subsidy schemes in the world. It represents 40 percent of the European budget — money that is meant to support farmers and sustain rural communities. Yet it is opaque in key areas, with gaping shortcomings in accountability. In November, a New York Times investigation revealed that the subsidies underwrite oligarchs, mobsters and far-right populists. The Times also showed that some national leaders use the money to enrich friends, political allies and family members. Such abuses succeed in part because of a system in Brussels that favors those who earn the most from the subsidies. Not only do they play an outsized role in setting policies, they also benefit from murky conflict-of-interest rules, weak lobbying-disclosure laws and a haphazard accountability system in which cases can drag on for years even when outright fraud is discovered. Agricultural lobbyists, among the most influential in Europe, have exclusive, closed-door access to government leaders. Conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the ministers who vote on legislation. And members of the European Parliament are not prohibited from writing the laws for the very subsidies they receive. “The powerful people who have land and the powerful people in government work together,” said Maria Noichl, a German member of the European Parliament who sponsored the Babis Amendment. “They both benefit from the program, and most people don’t know how it works.” Renewing the seven-year farm bill is one of the top priorities on the European agenda. Debate will intensify next year when the European Parliament and council consider whether to grant national leaders like Mr. Babis greater flexibility over how the money is spent. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, only to face lambasting in the Parliament. For years, European leaders have been warned that the subsidies encourage corruption, harm the environment and underwrite land-grabbing. Yet major change remains difficult when so many lobbyists, lawmakers and farm officials want to keep the system intact. Andrej Babis became prime minister of the Czech Republic promising to run the state like a business. But he is often accused of running the state as if it were his business. After the end of the Cold War, Mr. Babis was among the former communists who bought up what remained of the old order. He built his empire through a relentless acquisition of farms, fertilizer companies, tractor suppliers and silos. In an industry dominated by big players, his company, Agrofert, is the biggest.  “I made it from nothing,” Mr. Babis said in an interview in New York. But his companies also have benefited from policies approved by governments that he has led or served in, prompting years of investigations over conflicts of interest, even as Agrofert continued to collect subsidies. When Mr. Babis was finance minister and deputy prime minister from 2014 to 2017, small farmers complained that they lost influence on a board that monitors and helps guide national policies for handing out farm subsidies. “So you can imagine what kind of a decision process takes place there,” said Jan Stefl, a 59-year-old Czech farmer. “It always favors the big farmers.”  Journalists then revealed that Mr. Babis had created a shell company that collected $2 million in European agricultural grants intended for small businesses. In 2017, European investigators and the Czech police recommended that he be prosecuted for fraud. But soon after that recommendation, Mr. Babis was elected prime minister. Prosecutors said they would review the investigative file. Two years later, they dropped the case. Last week, they reopened it. That is common because European fraud investigators must work with local authorities to conduct most investigations. They can recommend charges but cannot file those charges themselves. And national prosecutors act on those recommendations only 36 percent of the time, officials said this year. “We are doing everything from our part,” a European Union spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said. “We’re not here to replace every single government in the E.U.” A European prosecutor’s office is being created next year to take up such cases, though some countries opted not to participate. That includes Hungary, where the prime minister’s family and friends have reaped millions in farm subsidies. In the Czech Republic, Mr. Babis has benefited from national laws that channel more European money to his companies. One rule that purports to limit runaway subsidy spending has instead created clear advantages for his company. The rule limits farmers to one grant application a year. But a company like Agrofert, which has at least 100 domestic subsidiaries, can apply many times. Mr. Babis said in the interview that he had nothing to do with those rule changes. He said the Czech government, regardless of political party, had for years supported large-scale farming. The European Union introduced stricter conflict-of-interest rules last year, but it is still unclear whether they cover heads of government like Mr. Babis. When a Czech politician asked for clarification last year, Europe’s top budget official replied that the answer required “a case-by-case analysis.” Using a Czech conflict-of-interest law, though, European investigators audited grants paid to Mr. Babis’s business this year. They found that even though Mr. Babis had put Agrofert into two trusts, he still controlled the company and therefore violated Czech law. The auditors ordered the Czech government to return all the money paid to Agrofert from European regional development and social funds, according to a leaked report obtained by the Czech news organization Denik N and shared with The Times. Mr. Babis said that he intended to return to Agrofert once he is out of office. So, if Agrofert benefits from his government’s policies, he ultimately stands to profit. But he assailed the audits, calling them “an attack on the Czech Republic” and labeling their authors incompetent. The appeals process is expected to take months. In the meantime, Mr. Babis is scheduled to join other elected national leaders on the European Council, which will meet in secret to set the European Union budget in the coming months. Czech opposition leaders have called for Mr. Babis to be excluded from that vote. One senator, Lukas Wagenknecht, urged European officials to stop paying “an East-European oligarch to establish a nondemocratic autocracy.” Mr. Babis is confident that he will be exonerated. “Nobody can corrupt me,” he said. “I’m quite a rich guy.” The defeat of the Babis Amendment barely registered with the most important lobbyists in the room. They had their eyes on the bigger picture: keeping the subsidy system intact, with as much money as possible. As long as there has been farm money, Copa-Cogeca, Europe’s largest organization for farmers, has swayed where it goes. European leaders have historically treated the group not as mere recipients of government money, but as partners in policymaking. Much has changed in recent decades: Environmental concerns have become a priority and farming has shrunk to 1 percent of Europe’s economy. Yet even today, Copa-Cogeca enjoys special access that would make others swoon. “On the subsidies, they are more powerful than anyone,” said Gérard Choplin, an agricultural policy expert and former lobbyist. Before meetings of European farm ministers, for example, the council president grants a private audience to Copa-Cogeca. That lets farm lobbyists — and only farm lobbyists — make their views heard before key decisions are made.  When environmental groups requested similar access last year, they were rebuffed. A council representative told them that Copa’s meeting was a matter of tradition, “to facilitate an exchange of information.” Lobbyists are not required to register in Brussels and the capital is filled with events bringing them together with policymakers. Staff members from Copa-Cogeca, the agricultural company Bayer and the European Commission formed a group called the Young Food Policy Network, which hosts happy hours for government and business officials. This is not lobbying, staffers said, just people having drinks. Copa-Cogeca draws its influence largely from the national farm unions, which can cause political headaches. This year in France, farmers blockaded roads and dumped tons of manure outside the office of a member of Parliament in a protest over a trade deal. Copa-Cogeca officials make no apologies for being advocates for their industry. They say farmers are expected to hold down food prices, keep quality high and fight climate change — all while dealing with a panoply of regulations and a shrinking farm budget. They say they have accepted years of reforms but will not accept anything that hurts the industry’s bottom line. “We cannot be green if we are in the red,” Pekka Pesonen, the group’s secretary general, said this year. Lawmakers hear that message often. Lobbyists in Brussels are free to roam the committee room floor, and Ms. Noichl of Germany said she hesitated to talk to her colleagues there. “There’s too many people listening,” she said. Soon after defeating the Babis Amendment, the committee prepared to vote on the full subsidy bill. It gave leaders like Mr. Babis new spending flexibility. Most important, it declared that the subsidy budget should not be cut. Before opening the vote, the committee chairman, Czeslaw Siekierski of Poland, paused for a reminder. “European farmers are watching us very closely,” he told his colleagues. “And we must make sure that we can deliver.” The vote passed. To many, Mr. Babis has become a symbol of conflict-of-interest in the subsidy system. But lesser-known government officials also have a stake in the policies they vote on. Among the lawmakers who killed the Babis Amendment were Mairead McGuinness of Ireland, whose family received $28,000 in subsidies last year; Peter Jahr of Germany, who received $15,600; and John Stuart Agnew of Britain, who disclosed receiving between $13,000 and $66,000 from a company that is paid subsidies. Lawmakers said they saw no problem with their vote. Ms. McGuinness said the bill would have unfairly punished farmers whose family members entered politics. Mr. Jahr noted that all lawmakers are affected by some laws, like taxes. “To a certain extent, it is inherent to the system,” he said. If the European Parliament disagrees, nobody is saying so. Its conflict-of-interest rule is vague and leaders have taken no position on whether members can vote on and receive subsidies. The responsibility for identifying conflicts, a Parliament spokeswoman said, “lies primarily with the member.” So reports about lawmakers receiving subsidies become background noise. “They vote on the money, and they and their families get the money,” Ms. Noichl said. And the members of another governing body, the Council of the European Union, are not subject to a conflict-of-interest policy at all. It comprises ministers from all 28 countries, who vote on legislation. Members of the Council are presumed to be representing their national governments, not themselves.   This means that Mr. Babis’ farm minister, Miroslav Toman, can vote on subsidy policy even though his brother and father run an agricultural company that was among the biggest Czech subsidy recipients last year. “Everyone has a stake in keeping the status quo,” said Alan Matthews, a  farm policy expert at Trinity College Dublin. Experts agree that one way to curtail abuses and address inequities would be to limit how much each person receives. Another would be to reconsider a formula that pays farmers based on how much land they hold. Franz Fischler, a former European agricultural commissioner, said he had tried more than 15 years ago to accomplish both. But Britain, where aristocrats own huge tracts of land, opposed the idea, Mr. Fischler said. So did Germany, home to large Soviet-style farms in what was once East Germany.  When his proposal died, Mr. Fischler warned that as the European Union expanded, the subsidies would widen the gap between rich and poor. “This is exactly where we are now,” he said. Even today, 23 of the 28 agricultural ministers who will vote on the farm bill have said they oppose a cap. “There is no real change,” said Ms. Noichl, the German lawmaker. “Not in Europe. In Europe it’s always the same.” The European Union can and does claw back misspent money. But veteran investigators ruefully joke that often the only penalty for stealing is having to return the money. For example, European investigators say they unraveled a scheme involving a Brussels-based company that received millions of dollars to promote Bulgarian agricultural products. The firm colluded with Bulgarian companies, inflated invoices and laundered money through shell companies, according to documents and current and former officials. The authorities identified a European official, Georgios Malliaris, who received cash from the scheme, according to the officials. Mr. Malliaris did not respond to repeated messages. Investigators recommended charges two years ago against the companies and Mr. Malliaris. European officials are working to recover the money from Bulgaria, but the authorities have not prosecuted any of the companies. A sealed criminal case against Mr. Malliaris and others is winding through the Belgian judicial system, current and former officials said. Until that case is resolved, European Union officials cannot take action against Mr. Malliaris. So he remains employed and has been moved to an archiving job.

Architect of Mexico’s War on Cartels Is Accused of Taking Bribes From One,2019-12-10,By Alan Feuer,"['A retired Mexican police official who once led his country’s equivalent of the F.B.I. was indicted in New York on Tuesday on charges of taking bribes while in office to protect the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of Mexico’s most powerful criminal mafias. The official, Genaro García Luna, served as the head of Mexico’s Federal Investigation Agency from 2001 to 2005, and for the next six years was Mexico’s secretary of public security, a cabinet-level position. In that role he was tasked with helping the president at the time, Felipe Calderón, craft his strategy to battle their country’s drug cartels. But according to prosecutors in Brooklyn, even while Mr. García Luna presented himself as the public face of the war against the drug trade in Mexico, he was quietly receiving millions of dollars from the Sinaloa cartel, which was run at the time by the drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera, better known as El Chapo.  Mr. García Luna is now in custody in Dallas.  An indictment unsealed on Tuesday in Brooklyn, where Mr. Guzmán was himself convicted on drug charges in February, also accused Mr. García Luna of lying to American investigators and taking part in a conspiracy to traffic cocaine. The arrest of Mr. García Luna, on Monday, was a signal event in the history of the drug war in Mexico — something akin to the director of the F.B.I. being taken into custody for receiving bribes from the head of the Gambino crime family. The charges against him, prosecutors said, were a direct result of testimony at Mr. Guzmán’s trial in New York.  At the trial, Jesús Zambada García, the brother of Mr. Guzmán’s chief partner, Ismael Zambada García, told the jury that he had twice personally given Mr. García Luna briefcases filled with at least $3 million in cash. Mr. Zambada also testified that a syndicate of Mexican traffickers was putting together a separate package of as much as $50 million in bribes for Mr. García Luna, although those payoffs seem not to have been made. In statements to reporters at the time, Mr. García Luna denied the allegations made during the trial.  In court papers, prosecutors said that they had obtained financial records showing that Mr. García Luna had amassed a vast personal fortune that was “inconsistent with a civil servant’s salary in Mexico.”  In 2012, after his public service ended, Mr. García Luna moved to Miami. The financial records indicated that Mr. García Luna continued to live in the United States “off the millions of dollars in bribes that the Sinaloa Cartel paid him,” the court papers said. Prosecutors also said that when Mr. García Luna submitted an application to become a naturalized United States citizen in 2018, he “affirmatively lied about his past criminal conduct on behalf of the Sinaloa cartel.” Mr. García Luna was expected in Federal District Court in Dallas on Tuesday afternoon for an initial appearance. His lawyer, Rose Romero, was not immediately available for comment.  Mexico’s attorney general’s office said Tuesday afternoon that it had been investigating Mr. García Luna for a range of possible crimes, including conspiracy to traffic cocaine, organized crime, making false statements and bribery. In a statement, the office said it planned to request the extradition of Mr. García Luna to Mexico. Politically astute and well-liked in Washington, where he often met with senators and White House aides, Mr. García Luna was, at least in public, a vocal critic of corruption in Mexico. He spent much of his time in office trying to reform the Mexican federal police, increasing their salaries and firing hundreds of police commanders he did not trust. He is considered the main architect of Mr. Calderón’s militarized approach to battling drug traffickers, which began in 2006 with the deployment of the armed forces against organized crime and the president’s official declaration of “war” on them. A cornerstone of the strategy was to focus on kingpins, on the theory that cutting off the head of a criminal organization would wither the body. Mr. Calderón and Mr. García Luna were partly successful in that approach, capturing or killing many of the most-wanted traffickers in the country. After almost every major arrest, Mr. García Luna delighted in posing suspects alongside captured weapons and drugs in a show for the news media. Among Mr. García Luna’s trophies while serving in Mr. Calderón’s cabinet was the arrest in 2010 of Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as La Barbie, an American-born drug trafficker. Mr. Valdez, in a letter sent to a national Mexican newspaper, later accused Mr. García Luna of having accepted bribes from organized crime groups — and from him directly. A spokesman for Mr. García Luna at the time denied the allegations and said they were an attempt to “publicly discredit” the Mexican authorities and “blackmail” them in exchange for privileges inside the federal prison where Mr. Valdez was being held. Mr. Calderón’s successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, took office in 2012 and followed a similarly militarized approach. And though the country’s homicide tallies declined from 2011 to late 2014, they have since trended upward. The current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed to end his predecessors’ war on drugs and remove the military from the streets in the fights against drug trafficking organizations.  But despite his creation of a new force, called the National Guard, violence has continued at record levels. And dramatic eruptions of violence — like a city siege by cartel gunmen and the murder of three women and six children — have raised questions about whether his strategy can staunch the bloodshed. Mr. Calderón, the former president, said in a tweet that he had learned about the “alleged arrest” of Mr. García Luna through social media and was waiting for more information about the case. “I do not know details,” he said. “My position will always be in favor of justice and the law.” Kirk Semple and Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.']",Genaro García Luna once served in a presidential cabinet and as the head of Mexico’s equivalent of the F.B.I.

"In First Meeting With Putin, Zelensky Plays to a Draw Despite a Bad Hand",2019-12-09,By Andrew Higgins,"['PARIS — It had the makings of a singularly unequal contest: a former K.G.B. officer and seasoned master of no-holds-barred global intrigue versus a former comedian bereft of any experience in power politics and battered by his country’s bruising encounters with President Trump. But the first face-to-face meeting on Monday between President Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s ruler for nearly 20 years, and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, turned out to be less a walkover for Mr. Putin than a draw, with modest progress made on calming five and half years of war in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky, who has been in office for just six months, said Russia and Ukraine had reached an agreement to exchange all prisoners by the end of the year and to fully implement a cease-fire first agreed to in 2015 but repeatedly broken. “I would like to have seen more,” said Mr. Zelensky, speaking at a joint news conference late Monday in Paris with Mr. Putin and the leaders of France and Germany, who were refereeing the meeting.  Mr. Zelensky added that it “is vital for Ukraine to restore control of the entire length of its border” with Russia in eastern Ukraine, which is currently controlled by separatist forces backed by Moscow. At the same news conference, Mr. Putin said relations with Ukraine, which had been in a deep freeze since a popular uprising toppled the pro-Russian Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in Feb. 2014, were now in a “thaw.” But he added that much needed to be done to achieve a stable settlement.  He stressed Russia’s longstanding position that the Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine, under the control of armed rebels supported by Moscow since 2014, should be given special status.  A peace deal reached in the Belarus capital of Minsk in February 2015 required Ukraine to change its laws and Constitution to provide for such a status but, like most elements of the Minsk agreement, this has not been put into effect. President Emmanuel Macron of France expressed hope that the summit, the first high-level peace talks in three years, had broken years of stalemate, while acknowledging that peace was still not at hand in a war that has killed more than 13,000 combatants and civilians. “We have not found a magic wand or a silver bullet, but we have relaunched the peace process,” he said. The Paris meeting, he added, was “a very positive step forward.”  The four leaders agreed to meet again in four months. Mr. Zelensky, under mounting pressure at home from nationalists who accuse him of capitulating to Russia, arrived in Paris with limited room to maneuver and far fewer military or political resources to call on than Mr. Putin. His previous gestures of good will, notably the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the front line, have won no reciprocal steps by Russia or the rebels it supports in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. His position was further weakened by the absence of strong support from the United States, something that Ukraine had previously relied on as it struggles to hold its own on the battlefield against Russian troops — which the Kremlin has insisted are not serving soldiers but merely Russians “on vacation” — as well as armed separatists supported by Moscow. The United States was never been formally involved in shaping or enacting the Minsk agreement, but under President Barack Obama it played a central role in “lassoing the various sides,” said Alina Polyakova, a fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Mr. Trump has been besieged by impeachment hearings focused on his dealings with Ukraine — specifically, an American delay in delivering promised military aid and the withholding of a much-coveted White House meeting for Mr. Zelensky — and by criticism of repeated foreign policy shifts that favor Mr. Putin. Perhaps as a result, the American president has shown little inclination to get involved in the nitty-gritty details of settling the war, telling Mr. Zelensky when they met in New York in September: “I really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.” Many Trump administration officials who advocated supporting Ukraine in its struggle against Russia have resigned or been sidelined. The State Department’s special envoy for Ukraine and its point man for settling the conflict in the east, Kurt D. Volker, resigned in September. What Ms. Polyakova described as “U.S. absenteeism” has left the task of mediating a settlement in Europe’s only active war in the hands of Angela Merkel, Germany’s lame-duck chancellor, and Mr. Marcon, who has in recent months tilted to a more conciliatory approach toward Russia.  As if to illustrate the imbalance between Russia and Ukraine, at the Élysée Palace, where each president was saluted on Monday by a French honor guard, Mr. Zelensky arrived first in a modest gray Renault minivan, followed by Mr. Putin in an Aurus, a massive, Russian-made armored limousine. Mr. Putin, as he often does, arrived late, but only by a few minutes. Both leaders had much to gain from the meeting. Mr. Putin desperately wants the West to lift sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea and its sponsorship of the separatists. Mr. Zelensky, a political neophyte, won a landslide victory in Ukraine’s April presidential election on promises to end the fighting. Mr. Zelensky also had much to lose, but unlike his predecessor, Petro O. Poroshenko, he avoided insulting Mr. Putin, whose relations with Ukraine’s previous president were so poisonous the two leaders stopped talking. “There are a lot of questions we haven’t succeed to solve today, and it’s necessarily to be done in the future,” Mr. Zelensky said. “I am sure we will definitely do it, together.” Rather than annexing the breakaway territory in the east, Russia has made clear that its aim is to keep Ukraine firmly under its influence, not integrated with the West economically, militarily or politically. Mr. Putin’s government has indicated that Ukraine could regain at least nominal sovereignty over the region, and control of its eastern border with Russia. Moscow’s price for such a settlement includes Ukraine staying out of the European Union and NATO, and changing its Constitution to give more authority to regional governments — including those where pro-Russian forces are likely to govern. Such an agreement would be seen by many Ukrainians as a capitulation to Mr. Putin and an infringement on their country’s independence. Yet there is no approach that commands anything resembling majority support in Ukraine — not making the concessions Russia is seeking, not continuing the war, and not ceding control of the territory. But Mr. Zelensky made clear at the news conference that there could be no movement on the political and constitutional changes that Russia wants until security issues, including control of the border, had been settled. He also ruled out conceding to Russia’s previously insistent demand that Ukraine become a federation instead of a unitary state. This, he said, will never happen. The Minsk agreements mapped out steps to be taken by each side, including elections in rebel-held regions, the return to Ukrainian control of a now-porous border with Russia, greater autonomy for the separatist region, and the disarming of militant groups. But the plan left unclear their sequence, with Russia insisting that political steps come first, while Ukraine wants to begin with those involving security. Worried that Mr. Zelensky might succumb to Mr. Putin’s powers of persuasion, as Mr. Trump did in Helsinki in July last year, three opposition groups in Ukraine issued a manifesto ahead of the Paris meeting drawing six “red lines” that should not be crossed. They demanded that Mr. Zelensky make no concessions to Mr. Putin on Ukraine’s “Euro-Atlantic” foreign policy, the status of eastern regions and the timing of elections in territory occupied by Russian-backed separatists. Early Tuesday morning, protesters gathered near Mr. Zelensky’s office in the center of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, voicing relief that the Paris meeting had not ended in the “capitulation” they had feared. Mr. Zelensky’s predecessor, Mr. Poroshenko, had urged Mr. Zelensky to “avoid meeting one on one with Putin,” who he said could never be trusted. “Don’t trust Putin. Ever and in anything,” he said. “Putin manipulates everything: content, facts, figures, maps, emotions. He hates Ukraine and Ukrainians.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.']","The presidents of Ukraine and Russia met face-to-face for the first time, seeking to end the war in their border region.

Boris Johnson Tries On a New Campaign Persona: Disciplined,2019-12-11,By Mark Landler,"['UTTOXETER, England — On the second-to-last day of Britain’s landmark election campaign, Prime Minister Boris Johnson drove a backhoe through a wall of Styrofoam bricks. The wall was labeled “Gridlock,” while the backhoe was emblazoned with a Union Jack and the slogan “Get Brexit Done.” As political stunts go, it was hardly subtle. But it was a fitting end to a campaign that has had all the nuance of an earth mover. When Mr. Johnson faces British voters on Thursday, he is betting that his blunt-force message on Brexit will bulldoze three and a half years of political gridlock. The polls indicate he might be right: His Conservative Party has clung to a steady, if narrowing, lead over the Labour Party. If it holds, it would give Mr. Johnson the majority in Parliament he needs to take Britain out of the European Union. For the 55-year-old prime minister, whose brief tenure has been marked by legal setbacks, scorched-earth politics and unrelenting turmoil, it would be a striking political vindication, one that belies his clownish image and positions him to lead Britain through its most radical transition since the end of World War II. “This is a momentous occasion for our country,” Mr. Johnson told workers at a gleaming new factory built by JCB, a British construction-equipment maker in the Midlands, after he had climbed out of the backhoe. “I’ve never known a moment when the choice before us was so clear and so stark.” Yet the deep bitterness of the campaign attests to the divisiveness of Mr. Johnson’s binary message. It is less an appeal to an inspiring new vision of Britain than a grim promise to voters utterly fed up with talking about Brexit that he will get it done — once and for all, and regardless of what comes afterward. For all his talk of how consequential this election is, Mr. Johnson has either avoided talking about the far-reaching effects of leaving the European Union or has made far-fetched claims about Britain’s shimmering post-Brexit future. His party’s campaign manifesto is brief and vague, designed to avoid the traps that ensnared his predecessor, Theresa May. He waves away thorny questions like how he plans to negotiate a trade agreement with Europe in less than 12 months. “This is a transactional election,” said Andrew Gimson, who wrote an early biography of Mr. Johnson. “People are voting for Boris to get Brexit done, not because they love the Conservative Party.” There are few more transactional figures in British politics than Mr. Johnson. Largely devoid of big ideas or a coherent ideological framework, he has climbed the ranks by combining a quicksilver political expediency with a populist’s instinct for appealing to certain voters. In this campaign, he has repeated the phrase “Get Brexit done” so often that it has become a kind of incantation. Never mind that Brexit — should Mr. Johnson get it done by the end of next month, as he has pledged — would be just the start of the next phase in the country’s painful divorce from the European Union, which could take many more years. Mr. Johnson is famous for his shambling manner, a raffish untidiness that extends from his clothes to his personal life. It has been one of the ingredients of his political success, lending him an ordinary-guy appeal that would otherwise come hard to a Greek-poetry-quoting graduate of Eton and Oxford. In the campaign, however, Mr. Johnson has shown himself to be remarkably disciplined, sticking to his message, despite the best efforts of his opponents to shift the debate to other issues, like health care or crime. He seems less the happy warrior than a hyper-cautious tactician, one who started the campaign with a healthy lead and has been determined not to put it at risk. “In a sense, you’re getting the truer Boris Johnson, which is not the clownish, cuddly fellow,” said Sonia Purnell, another of Mr. Johnson’s biographers. “He is more ruthless than anyone you or I have ever met.” Mr. Gimson offered a more generous interpretation. “He’s quite an experienced campaigner,” he said. “Boris actually has thought through his campaign plan, and all the evidence on the ground is that it is working.” Mr. Johnson spent much of the campaign in the Midlands and the north, wooing working-class voters in corroded industrial towns who once voted so reliably for the Labour Party that the region was known as the party’s “red wall.” Many of them voted for Brexit in 2016 and blame the political establishment for thwarting their democratic will. He has hoisted a gutted cod in a fish market in the port town of Grimsby, weighed boxes of tea bags at a Tetley Tea factory in Eaglescliffe, in the northeast, and mopped a floor in the flood-damaged Derbyshire town of Matlock — drawing japes for his janitorial skills but grudging affection for the effort. “I like Boris,” said Malt Keeling, a butcher in Sutton-in-Ashfield, a Midlands town where the Conservative candidate for Parliament has a good chance of picking off a longtime Labour seat. “He’s not for the working man, I admit that,” said Mr. Keeling, who is 55. “But the Tories run the economy better.” Mark Heald, an unemployed Labour voter in nearby Kirkby-in-Ashfield, credited Mr. Johnson for putting Britain on the brink of leaving the European Union. “Everything he’s said he would do, he’s done it,” he said. But Mr. Heald, 44, said he was not ready to break with Labour. “This is the thing about this country: Who do you trust?” he said. “I don’t trust any of them. I’ve voted Labour all my life, so I’ll stick with them.” Trustworthiness has never been Mr. Johnson’s strong suit, and he did little to improve his reputation during this campaign. At the factory in Uttoxeter, he promised that Brexit would uncork a flood of pent-up investment in Britain (“We’ll start to get our mojo back, to be perfectly frank,” he said). What he failed to mention was that his own government had forecast that Brexit could reduce growth by as much as 6.4 percent of Britain’s gross domestic product by 2034. As he has throughout his career, Mr. Johnson still affects a carefree insouciance about the details. In Uttoxeter, he said he needed to wrap up his remarks because, “I now have to go,” pausing for several awkward seconds, as he looked around for a prompt from an aide, “somewhere else.” The audience tittered. Still, Mr. Johnson’s single-mindedness has unexpectedly made his campaign a somewhat joyless affair. There have been few moments of genuine spontaneity and more instances of protesters heckling. The most memorable image of Mr. Johnson’s campaign may prove to be his tense exchange with a local reporter who was trying to show him a photo of a child who had been forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital in Leeds because of a lack of beds. Rather than express sympathy for the child, a defensive Mr. Johnson grabbed the reporter’s phone and stuffed it in his pocket. Mr. Johnson’s aides have tried to soften his image. They released a commercial, inspired by a scene from the film, “Love Actually,” in which he turns up at a woman’s door and pleads wordlessly for her vote with flash cards (one of the film’s stars, Hugh Grant, has campaigned vigorously against him). But the prime minister, who made his name as a journalist, has methodically avoided scrutiny from the news media. He limits access to reporters who cover his campaign and ducked an interview with the BBC’s infamous interrogator, Andrew Neil. On Wednesday, when a reporter asked him to go on camera with the TV anchor Piers Morgan, Mr. Johnson escaped into a walk-in refrigerator. Such tactics outrage journalists in London. But it is not clear that they have hurt him with the working-class voters he is targeting. Despite Mr. Johnson’s messy personal life, allegations of misconduct while he was mayor of London and his disingenuous handling of Brexit, the news media have scarcely laid a hand on him. In this, he is similar to another populist politician with a checkered past who ran a convention-flouting campaign and won, said Baroness Rosalind Scott, a member of the House of Lords and a former president of the Liberal Democrats. “One of the things they learned from Donald Trump,” she said, “is that the rules are there to be broken.”']","The British prime minister is more grim tactician now than “the clownish, cuddly fellow” of the past.

"In Collecting Nobel Prize, Ethiopia’s Leader Plans to Sidestep Media",2019-12-09,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['[View the latest updates to the 2020 Nobel Prize winners list.] NAIROBI, Kenya — When the Norwegian Nobel Committee chose the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, for its peace prize this fall, it cited his efforts to free his country from years of political repression by releasing political prisoners, legalizing outlawed opposition groups and “discontinuing media censorship.” But when Mr. Abiy collects his prize in Oslo on Tuesday, he will not take questions from the news media, a move that breaks from tradition and has drawn criticism from the Nobel Committee.  Mr. Abiy won’t speak to reporters ahead of the awards ceremony or take questions after meeting with the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, Nobel officials said. He is also planning to skip an annual event where children perform for, and pose questions to, the peace prize laureate, hosted by Save the Children. Mr. Abiy’s minister of peace will attend on his behalf, the prime minister’s office said. A spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said that Mr. Abiy had more pressing priorities and that such events were not in keeping with “the humble disposition of the prime minister rooted in our cultural context.” But Mr. Abiy also has reasons to avoid scrutiny. Since winning the prestigious prize in October, he has faced criticism over his administration’s heavy-handed response to protests that grew after a prominent critic of Mr. Abiy accused the police of orchestrating an attack on him. On Monday, a United Nations report sounded an alarm over a proposed new hate speech law. David Kaye, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, issued the report after visiting Ethiopia, saying the bill could give government officials “unbounded discretion” to prosecute and arrest people. Mr. Abiy was awarded the peace prize for his initiative to resolve the decades-long border conflict with neighboring Eritrea, and for making significant political, economic, and social changes in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most-populous nation, since he came to power in mid-2018. Mr. Abiy, for example, named women to top governmental positions and engaged in efforts to bolster peace in nations including South Sudan, Somalia and Kenya. In awarding him the prize, the Nobel Committee said his actions gave “many citizens hope for a better life and a brighter future.” But the Nobel Committee has not hidden its disappointment with Mr. Abiy’s refusal to participate in its events. The committee’s chairman, Berit Reiss-Andersen, called it “regrettable” and “unfortunate,” according to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.  The director of the Nobel Institute, Olav Njolstad, traveled last week to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to try to change Mr. Abiy’s mind, but failed.  Mr. Abiy will give an acceptance speech and attend the Nobel banquet on Tuesday, as the guest of honor. The prize comes with about $1 million, a gold medal and a diploma.  Ms. Seyoum, Mr. Abiy’s press secretary, said of his decision to skip the media engagements, “It is quite challenging for a sitting head of state to dedicate that many days, particularly where domestic issues are pressing and warrant attention.”  The award comes during a fraught time for Ethiopia. Mr. Abiy faces a weak economy, regular outbreaks of deadly intercommunal violence and growing demands for statehood from numerous ethnic groups. He will be up for re-election next year. William Davison, senior Ethiopia analyst with the International Crisis Group, said that Mr. Abiy’s decision to avoid the news media in Oslo “may be due partly to the acute domestic challenges the prime minister is facing.” Even though Mr. Abiy “enjoys huge amounts of international good will that is not going to expire anytime soon,” Mr. Davison said, avoiding the media is “not a good look and should have been avoided.” Though his time as prime minister began with moves to ease media censorship, his administration has recently resorted to “old tactics,” including shutting down the internet and arresting journalists, said Muthoki Mumo, sub-Saharan Africa representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. Given these concerns, Mr. Abiy’s “refusal to answer media questions as he receives the Nobel Peace Prize reflects his government’s disregard for the role of the free press in keeping the public informed,” Ms. Mumo added.

Trump Officials Block U.N. Meeting on Human Rights Abuses in North Korea,2019-12-09,By Edward Wong and Choe Sang-Hun,"['WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has refused to support a move by members of the United Nations Security Council to hold a discussion Tuesday on North Korea’s rampant human rights abuses, effectively blocking the meeting for the second year in a row. The American action appeared aimed at muting international criticism of Pyongyang’s human rights record in the hope of preserving a tenuous diplomatic opening between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the authoritarian leader of North Korea. Tensions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have broken out into the open in recent days. On Monday, North Korea called Mr. Trump a “heedless and erratic old man” after the American president warned that Mr. Kim could lose “everything” if he resumed military provocations like nuclear or long-range missile tests before the 2020 elections in the United States. A proposed meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday had been intended to put a spotlight on North Korea on Human Rights Day, which is held every Dec. 10 to mark the day in 1948 when the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Eight of the council’s 15 members had signed a letter to schedule the meeting but needed a ninth member — the minimum required. United Nations diplomats, confirming a report in Foreign Policy, said the United States had declined to sign. Asked on Monday about the administration’s blocking of the meeting, a State Department spokesman said any discussion of North Korea by the Security Council should cover recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, including missile launches by Pyongyang and a test at a satellite launch site. The council plans to discuss them on Wednesday. The absence of American support for a discussion of human rights in North Korea is a conspicuous change under the Trump administration. In 2014, after a United Nations commission released a report on widespread rights violations in North Korea, the Americans supported an annual meeting on the council devoted to the subject. The North Korean government was infuriated.  But last year, the Americans withdrew its support for such a meeting as Mr. Trump made diplomatic overtures to Mr. Kim, according to officials and diplomats, and no meeting was held. Mr. Trump’s critics say the action is consistent with what they regard as a transactional approach to foreign policy that diminishes concern for human rights. The president has embraced authoritarian leaders who oversee widespread abuses in their countries and rarely talks about rights violations. Mr. Trump has blocked sanctions on Chinese officials for running internment camps holding at least one million Muslims, for example, to try to reach a trade deal with China. “North Korea and other abusive governments that the United States is going easy on are undoubtedly elated that the days of U.S. criticism of their human rights records appear to be over for the time being,” said Louis Charbonneau, United Nations officer at Human Rights Watch.  Even with the derailment of the human rights meeting, the North Korean government has intensified its recent invective aimed at Mr. Trump. Kim Yong-chol, a hard-liner who speaks for the North Korean military, issued a statement criticizing Mr. Trump hours after the American leader warned on Twitter on Sunday that Kim Jong-un had “far too much to lose, everything actually, if he acts in a hostile way.”  Mr. Trump also \u200bwarned that the North Korean leader should not “void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the U.S. Presidential Election in November” by resuming \u200bhostile acts. The messages came after North Korea announced on Sunday that it had carried out a “very important test” at its missile-engine test site. Analysts said the test probably involved a booster engine that could be used to propel a satellite-delivery rocket or an intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim Yong-chol, who is chairman of the North’s Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, said in response to the president’s comments that “Trump has too many things that he does not know about” North Korea, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. “We have nothing more to lose,” he said. The North Korean official also said\u200b that\u200b Mr. Trump’s latest Twitter messages showed that \u200bthe president was “an old man bereft of patience.” He accused Mr. Trump of \u200btrying to buy time before the Dec. 31 deadline set by Kim Jong-un for Washington to return to negotiations with concessions, including the lifting of sanctions. “As he is such a heedless and erratic old man, the time when we cannot but call him a ‘dotard’ again may come,” Kim Yong-chol said, referring to personal insults and threats of nuclear war that \u200bKim Jong-un and Mr. Trump exchanged two years ago. In 2017, amid escalating nuclear tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, Mr. Trump threatened to “totally destroy North Korea” if it threatened the United States, and called Kim Jong-un a “little rocket man” on a “suicide mission.” Mr. Kim retorted\u200b that Mr. Trump was “a mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” Relations between the American and North Korean leaders later warmed — but the new attack on Mr. Trump underscored the tensions. Kim Yong-chol visited Mr. Trump at the White House in June 2018 and again in January this year to deliver letters written to the president by Kim Jong-un. In the months after \u200bMr. Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first summit meeting in Singapore in June 2018 to discuss ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, \u200bthe American leader said he and the North Korean leader had fallen “in love.” Even as subsequent talks stalled, Mr. Trump continued to claim a “good relationship” with Mr. Kim.  But in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has also revived his old “rocket man” taunt. Last week, while urging North Korea to keep its promise to denuclearize, Mr. Trump warned that the United States would use military force if necessary. On Thursday, North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, said that Mr. Trump’s use of the “rocket man” insult was a sign of “the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.” On Saturday, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, issued a statement that suggested North Korea would no longer discuss denuclearization, Reuters reported. North Korean officials have warned that their government might end its self-imposed moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests if Washington does not meet Mr. Kim’s Dec. 31 deadline. A vice foreign minister of North Korea warned last week that it was up to Washington to decide what kind of “Christmas gift” it would receive from Pyongyang. On Monday, Kim Yong-chol, the North Korean official, warned that the United States should be ready to be “surprised.” Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, South Korea.

"The War That Continues to Shape Russia, 25 Years Later",2019-12-10,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — It began not so much as an invasion, but as a slouching stumble through mud and snow by frightened, ill-fed Russian conscripts, the hollowed-out remnants of a force that, before the collapse of the Soviet Union just three years earlier, had been the mighty Red Army. But the Russian troops who advanced from three directions into the rebellious region of Chechnya on Dec. 11, 1994, carried history-changing forces that have since reshaped Russia and the world. The Russian attack, initially in staggering disarray but then increasingly organized and brutal, signaled not just the start of the First Chechen War — a merciless conflict that killed tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians — but also the end of Russia’s liberal dream.  It was a turning point that tilted Russia toward the rule of President Vladimir V. Putin, now in power for two decades. At the time, Mr. Putin was an unknown municipal official in St. Petersburg, but five years later he became master of the Kremlin, propelled there by yet another Chechen war.  Anatoly Shabad, a former physicist and prominent pro-democracy politician in the early 1990s, visited Chechnya repeatedly in 1994, first to try to prevent war and then to halt the killing once it started. Holed up in the basement of the presidential palace in Grozny, the Chechen capital, as Russian forces launched a disastrous, all-out assault on the city on New Year’s Eve 1994, Mr. Shabad emerged in the morning to find streets strewn with the corpses of Russian soldiers and their burned-out tanks. Despite the Grozny debacle and many others, Mr. Shabad said, security and military officials who had pushed for the war — known as “siloviki,” or men of force — came out on top, regaining much of the influence they had lost to democratic forces after the Soviet Union imploded in 1991. “The siloviki were the losers on the ground but they acquired power. The time of democratic transformation passed and society returned to its old state of mind,” Mr. Shabad, now retired from politics, recalled. When President Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia’s first elected leader, announced 25 years ago that he would “employ all means at the state’s disposal” to crush Chechen demands for independence, he expected to subdue the Chechens with a swift show of overwhelming force. The hope and expectation was that Russia would repeat the success that the United States military had in Haiti, which it had invaded in September 1994 to swiftly remove a military dictatorship. Instead, the Chechen war dragged on for nearly two years and achieved none of Russia’s principal aims other than the death of the region’s despotic leader, Dzokhar Dudayev, who was killed in April 1996 by a laser-guided Russian missile. The war reduced Grozny, a modern, multiethnic city, to a rubble-strewn wasteland reminiscent of Stalingrad in World War II, and shredded Russia’s post-Soviet image as a peaceful democracy. It also set up a second war in 1999 that helped convince Mr. Yeltsin — ill, often drunk and never fully recovered from the trauma of the first war — to hand over power to Mr. Putin on the eve of the new millennium. The horrific brutality of the conflict turned what began as a secular nationalist movement in Chechnya into a cause increasingly colored by militant Islam, with many fighters viewing their battle against Russia as part of a global jihad. Money and fighters poured in from the Middle East during the later stages of the war, turning Chechnya into a breeding ground for the violent ideology of Al Qaeda. The 1994-96 war was freighted with foreboding from the start, with many of Mr. Yeltsin’s most stalwart supporters and senior military figures warning of disaster. “It will be a blood bath, another Afghanistan,” predicted Gen. Boris Gromov, the deputy defense minister, who had led the last Soviet troops home from that country in February 1989. The deputy commander of Russia’s ground force resigned in protest. Like the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the first Chechen war ended in a stalemate. Russia pulled out after signing a peace accord that left Chechnya’s ultimate status undecided but essentially gave the region the self-rule that Moscow had gone to war to prevent. And like the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Russian departure from Chechnya left a devastated land that quickly descended into lawless strife among rival factions. While the Afghan war had pushed the Soviet Union toward collapse, the Russian Federation survived the Chechen debacle. But it was utterly humiliated and fundamentally reshaped. That made the ascent of a strongman like Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent who vowed to restore order and avenge Russia’s defeat in Chechnya, not only possible but perhaps also inevitable. The 1994 invasion “was a real crossing of the Rubicon for Russia,” said Thomas de Waal, a British expert on the Caucasus who co-wrote “Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus,” a classic book on the conflict, with Carlotta Gall, now a reporter with The New York Times. The war, he said, “sucked the whole country into a violent nightmare” as soldiers, mostly ill-trained conscripts, were thrown into the caldron. “The hawks lost the war but won power,” Mr. de Waal said. The official Russian military death toll was nearly 6,000, but most independent estimates put the real figure at perhaps twice that or more. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000. Mr. Yeltsin’s decision to send troops into Chechnya was initially billed as a straightforward exercise to “restore constitutional order” and reverse the declaration of an independent state. But as with subsequent Russian military interventions, notably in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, the war began with an elaborate subterfuge orchestrated by Russian intelligence. Fifteen days before the main invasion, dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers poured into Chechnya, in what was presented as a push by Chechen opposition groups to topple Mr. Dudayev. The attack fit into a Russian narrative — repeated today in eastern Ukraine — that Moscow was simply a bystander in a local conflict. But this story quickly unraveled, when Chechen fighters halted the advance, captured tank crews, revealed them to be Russian, and paraded them before Russian and foreign journalists. Mr. Shabad, who visited Grozny in late November 1994 with other Russian lawmakers, said it was immediately obvious that official denials of Russian involvement were lies. “They pretended that the Chechens were just fighting among themselves,” he said, “but the whole thing was organized by Russia, mainly the F.S.K.,” the domestic intelligence agency that succeeded the K.G.B., with the connivance of the military. Andrei Rusakov, an army captain among the 20 or so Russians captured, told how he had signed a secret contract in which the F.S.K. — now called the F.S.B. — offered him several thousand dollars to take part in the phony Chechen opposition attack. The revelation of the security service’s failure prompted public gloating by Russia’s military. Pavel S. Grachev, the defense minister, stated on television that the armed forces could have taken control of Chechnya with “one paratroop regiment in a couple of hours.” His boast quickly came back to haunt him, when Mr. Yeltsin ordered the military to invade. The disastrous performance of the armed forces made Mr. Grachev perhaps the most reviled man in Russia, amid accusations that he had pushed for a military solution simply to disperse the whiff of corruption around him and his ministry. After the failed New Year’s Eve attack on Grozny, Russian forces pounded it relentlessly from the air, an orgy of destruction that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany denounced as “sheer madness.” The Russians finally captured the city, but as the war ground on amid horrendous brutality on both sides, Chechens recaptured it the following year, and laid siege to Russian forces in other major towns. In August 1996, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, Mr. Yeltsin’s national security adviser, reached an agreement with the Chechens to stop the fighting. Mr. Yeltsin, increasingly infirm, erratic and under siege politically, initially balked at the deal, which effectively acknowledged Russia’s defeat, but ultimately endorsed it. “The main thing,” he said, “is that bloodshed has been stopped.” Produced by Gaia Tripoli.']",
U.K. Health Service Poses a Late Election Issue for Boris Johnson,2019-12-10,By Benjamin Mueller,"['COVENTRY, England — Along with millions of Britons, Jules Barcroft bought into the bold promise made by Boris Johnson in the 2016 Brexit campaign: that leaving the European Union would bring buckets of new money into the long starved National Health Service.  So she voted for Leave, staking her own health — she has multiple sclerosis and lifelong diabetes — on that pledge by Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister.  Three years later, however, she feels used. “That was all a lie,” Ms. Barcroft said. “Why would they look after our medical needs? That’s not high on their agenda at all.” With Britain on the precipice of an election that could soon lead to a decisive break with the European Union, Brexit looks to many people more like a threat to their cherished health service than its salvation. The system has already deteriorated under the watch of Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party, with beds overflowing, waiting times swelling and nurse and doctor vacancies piling up. In recent days, the growing strains on the National Health Service jolted the campaign as some hospitals buckled under wintertime demands, and an irritated Mr. Johnson struggled to respond.  The problems vindicated a drumbeat of warnings from the Labour Party that Mr. Johnson was undermining Britons’ health care for Brexit. And they created a potent threat to Mr. Johnson’s campaign in the waning days of an otherwise sluggish race. It did not help matters that, shown a picture during a television interview on Monday of a 4-year-old boy lying on the floor of an overcrowded hospital, Mr. Johnson at first refused to look. Instead he repeated Brexit talking points, leaving many with a lasting image of the sort of icy, oblivious lawmaker who represents what swing voters fear most about the Conservatives’ record on public services.  The Conservatives have a healthy lead in national polls, but that disguises considerable uncertainty in dozens of hotly contested seats, making any missteps by Mr. Johnson significant as Labour tries to close the gap. Mr. Johnson, using the tactics of the 2016 Brexit campaign, has tried to inoculate himself by rebranding the Conservatives as the protectors of the health service, though not without some controversy. He recently had to acknowledge that a pledge for 50,000 more nurses included funding for only 31,000 new recruits. Similarly, after Mr. Johnson announced plans to build 40 new hospitals around the country, it became clear that the government was giving the money to six hospitals to upgrade existing buildings. But that has not stopped Mr. Johnson from writing a stream of Twitter posts about the health service and visiting hospitals with promises of better primary care and new equipment. The efforts may have paid off: Some polls show that Mr. Johnson is now more trusted than the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to take care of the health service. But the challenges to the health service will continue after the election on Thursday — all the more so if the result leaves Britain heading toward contentious post-Brexit trade negotiations with the United States. President Trump, as part of his “America First” agenda, has vowed to make foreigners pay more for American-produced pharmaceuticals. Britain, desperate for a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States, would be susceptible to requests that it drop its stranglehold on drug prices, trade experts say. At the same time, pressure on the health service has been building since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 and trimmed annual budget increases during a long period of austerity. Hospital waiting times reached record highs in October, with one in six people who visited emergency departments in England waiting longer than four hours to be seen. The number of people on hospital waiting lists has ballooned to nearly five million. And now the health service is going into winter — a particularly busy period for hospitals — while dealing with a pension crisis, bed shortages and the prospect of a major flu outbreak. Medical chiefs are concerned about how they will cope. “I would say that in the last five to six years, I haven’t seen confidence levels this low heading into winter,” said Siva Anandaciva, a chief analyst at The King’s Fund, a health care charity. Ms. Barcroft lives in the Coventry area, a pocket of working-class Labour strongholds in central England being targeted by Mr. Johnson, and she is one of many voters for whom the health service has become the dominant issue in the days leading up to the election. Some polls show that the health service is neck and neck with Brexit as the most important issue to potential voters. For Labour, success on Election Day is dependent in large part on whether it can pull the focus from Brexit and make a case that Mr. Johnson would squander precious public services. The party has pledged to outspend the Conservatives by pumping an additional 26 billion pounds, or about $34 billion, into the health service annually by 2024. Eager to hold onto its mantle as the party of the National Health Service, Labour has also vowed to undo shifts in recent decades toward privatization — a move that would entail a major reorganization of the health service. A Labour supporter for most of her life, Ms. Barcroft is sympathetic to Mr. Johnson’s message that Britain needs to get Brexit done, despite her misgivings about voting for it in 2016. But since then, she has also dealt with the ravages of an overburdened health service working under the cloud of Brexit.  Ms. Barcroft, a Type 1 diabetic, has had to keep a stock of out-of-date, secondhand insulin in her fridge, just in case a disorderly Brexit suddenly chokes off her usual supply. With the major insulin manufacturers all in continental Europe, diabetes patients have pushed for guarantees that they will be able to refill prescriptions if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal managing future relations. Some patients say they have ordered extra insulin to protect against a no-deal Brexit. Others started buying blood monitoring equipment on Amazon or stocking up on other patients’ leftover supplies, as Ms. Barcroft has done. “I do feel a bit like I’ve got to look after myself here,” she said. Ms. Barcroft also said her regular nurses were often missing from her monthly infusion treatments for multiple sclerosis. Nearly 5,000 nurses from European Union countries have left the British health service since the Brexit referendum, part of an exodus of more than 10,000 European workers who were once a mainstay of the health service staff. And some facilities have flatly refused to give Ms. Barcroft her regular medications on the grounds of cost, she said, adding that one doctor had pulled out a book of drug prices to explain why she could not be given her multiple sclerosis infusions in that area. The doctor suggested she take steroids instead. “I came out of there and I just thought, ‘Oh my god, I am such a burden on the N.H.S.,’” Ms. Barcroft said. “He literally spelled out to me how much money I was costing the N.H.S. I just felt like I’m a drain on resources.”  She said the experience had left her unable to support the Conservatives, but she also had deep reservations about Mr. Corbyn’s leadership. In the days before the election, she doubted that she would vote at all. Trade experts say drug prices could rise further after Brexit. Mr. Trump said this summer that the health service would be “on the table” in trade talks, before later backtracking on that claim amid efforts to protect Mr. Johnson, an ally, from criticism.   But government documents recently circulated by the Labour Party (and initially posted online by an account linked to a Russian campaign) indicated that American trade negotiators saw British drug prices as a “key consideration going forward.” For a country that has not negotiated its own trade deals in decades, the risks to the health service have driven home the fact that Britain will not always get its way on the world stage, said Tom Kibasi, a left-wing policy analyst who once worked for the chief executive of the National Health Service. “It’s just dawning on the public that this idea of a trade deal is not as one way as they think it is,” Mr. Kibasi said. “People know when there is a limited N.H.S. budget, if the U.S. forces higher prices onto the U.K. as part of a trade deal, that means less money for other services. The threat is about selling out the N.H.S. to get a deal with Trump.”']",There is a dawning realization among voters that the prime minister’s vow to complete Brexit could undermine the N.H.S.
‘There Were No Safety Features’: Outrage Follows New Delhi Fire,2019-12-09,By Kai Schultz and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — The phone calls started before dawn, frantic young men dialing relatives in faraway villages. As a fire engulfed the building where they worked and slept in New Delhi, blocking exits and filling rooms with smoke, the trapped men bid loved ones goodbye through sobs. “There is no escape route, no option at all,” one of the men, Muhammad Musharraf, told a friend on the phone, as others screamed in the background. “I can’t even breathe.” The blaze that killed at least 43 people and injured dozens more early Sunday in New Delhi was one of the worst on record in the country, and it highlighted chronic problems with slipshod city planning and lax enforcement of fire regulations in the Indian capital. The four-story residential building was one of several thousand in northern Delhi that had been illegally converted into a factory. Officials said the five or so businesses operating inside were unlicensed.  The building, in the neighborhood of Anaj Mandi, had no fire safety certification or emergency escape route. Windows were blocked with metal grills, flammable objects covered staircases and one of the building’s two exits was locked when the fire broke out, according to Atul Garg, the chief fire officer in New Delhi.  Many workers slept 10 to 15 in tiny, dimly lit rooms, where they spent their days making paper products, backpacks, plastic toys and clothing. Most were young Muslim men, some of them teenagers, who had come from distant villages in search of jobs that paid just a few dollars a day. “There were no safety features,” Mr. Garg said. The building’s owner, whom officials identified simply as Rehan, had also built at least one additional floor that did not meet minimum safety standards. He has been arrested and charged with crimes of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and “negligent conduct.” Varsha Joshi, a commissioner for the local municipal corporation, told reporters that officials tried to inspect the building last week, as part of a bigger project closing illegal manufacturing units, but that some of the floors had been locked.  According to city data, at least 2,800 businesses have been found to work from residential buildings without proper paperwork in northern Delhi, though officials said the true figure could easily surpass 10,000. Fires occur regularly in India’s cramped urban centers. New Delhi and its suburbs, a metropolis of more than 46 million, is full of dilapidated apartments squished into cubbyhole alleys.  Many businesses opt to rent floors in these buildings rather than spend more on factories in industrial areas. Even there, disaster often strikes. Last year, a blaze at a fireworks factory on the outskirts of New Delhi killed at least 17 people. The fire on Sunday started on the building’s second or third floor around 5 a.m., possibly from a short circuit.  Thirty minutes later, dozens of firefighters were at the scene, but they struggled to reach the entrance: A small lane leading to the building could not accommodate more than one truck, and the path was further blocked by parked motorcycles. As smoke billowed from the building, workers trapped inside screamed for help through the window grills. Firefighters broke down doors and carried unconscious men on their backs.  The streets, clogged with hundreds of people and convoys carrying politicians, became so chaotic that some victims were transported to hospitals in auto rickshaws. It took firefighters several hours to douse the flames. “If there was an unlocked exit on the top floor, many more people might have been saved,” said Mohammad Irfan, a resident who lives at the end of the alley. On Monday, relatives wound through the halls of Lok Nayak Hospital to identify the dead and tend to the injured. Among them was Alauddin Nadab, who rushed between the burn unit, where his brother was being treated, and the hospital’s mortuary, where the bodies of two cousins were stored. Early Sunday, a relative from the state of Bihar called Mr. Nadab, who also lives in Anaj Mandi, telling him that his brother and cousins were trapped in the building, where they each earned about $7 a day making hats and leather products. When Mr. Nadab reached the hospital, doctors told him that his cousins had already died and that his 22-year-old brother had little chance of surviving. Sixty percent of his body was covered in burns. “This is the life of poor men in this country,” Mr. Nadab said.

"Jeremy Corbyn, U.K. Labour Leader, Struggles to Close Election Gap",2019-12-11,By Stephen Castle,"['BIRMINGHAM, England — The chants are the same as in 2017: “Oh JER-e-my COR-byn, Oh JER-e-my COR-byn.” The message, taking on “the rich and powerful” and ending austerity with a burst of nationalizations and public spending, is largely the same, too. Yet, two years later, the magic that seemed to envelop the opposition Labour leader’s campaign in 2017 and deprived the Tories of their parliamentary majority seems to be lacking. With Labour mired in a continuing crisis over anti-Semitism, opinion polls suggest that Mr. Corbyn is struggling even to repeat his surprisingly strong 2017 performance, let alone score an outright victory for his brand of socialism in the general election on Thursday. But little of that pessimism was on display at a recent rally in Birmingham, England, where an eclectic blend of poetry, music and political speeches was met with deafening cheers. A celebrity guest, a Birmingham-born singer, Jamelia, told the crowd that she had never voted before but will do so, at age 38, for Mr. Corbyn. “We all know the story,” she later added, “of David and Goliath.”  David, in this case, is Mr. Corbyn, a 70-year-old veteran activist who spent three decades on the fringes of politics, yet could become Britain’s most left-wing prime minister in living memory, albeit probably only at the head of a minority government.  That outcome in itself would be momentous, with big implications for the country’s future and, of course, Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to pile up a clear parliamentary majority if he is to take Britain out of the European Union next month, as he has promised. In the final stretch of the campaign, the Labour Party has shifted to a more defensive posture. That has meant pouring precious resources into traditional strongholds in the north and middle of the country — places that voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum — rather than trying to win Conservative districts in the south that voted to remain.  The hope is that Labour can lure undecided Britons and squeeze the vote of the centrist Liberal Democrats, whose campaign seems to have faltered. As Election Day approached, many opinion polls tightened, jangling nerves among Mr. Johnson’s team. Still, many Labour supporters had expected more, considering that nine years of Conservative rule have produced tough and unpopular austerity policies and more than three years of political chaos over Brexit. “There is now some panic about whether Labour can hold some of their existing seats,” said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. “It has now become a defensive campaign, and from the perspective of what we had been led to believe, that is a clear defeat.” Mr. Corbyn’s leadership has been marred by factionalism and by persistent claims that he has tolerated anti-Semitism within Labour’s ranks. The critics include the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, the spiritual leader of much of Britain’s Orthodox Jewish community, who argued that “a new poison — sanctioned from the very top — has taken root.”  Leaks of a submission from the Jewish Labour Movement to Britain’s Equality and Human Rights Commission included 70 sworn testimonies from current and former Labour staffers, and concludes that “the Labour party is no longer a safe space for Jewish people,” The Guardian reported. Frustratingly for many Labour supporters, Mr. Corbyn has resisted making flat-out apologies, refusing four opportunities in one TV interview before doing so, somewhat reluctantly, in a second. Coming from the far left, Mr. Corbyn has always faced hostility from Britain’s news media, which is dominated by right-wing tabloids. That, in part, is why Mr. Corbyn was written off by many in the 2017 campaign before confounding his critics. But that was then. In 2017 Mr. Corbyn was less well-known and benefited from the greater exposure broadcasters had to give him during an election under British law. Many voters were pleasantly surprised to see a personable, grandfatherly figure, a man who toils on his garden allotment, makes his own jam, rides a bicycle and was a multiple winner of Parliament’s beard of the year competition. His unashamedly socialist message struck a chord with many young people, and when he spoke after the 2017 election at the Glastonbury rock festival, the crowd chanted his name to the opening riff from the White Stripes song “Seven Nation Army.” But that enthusiasm seems to have waned during two years of wearisome and fruitless haggling in Parliament over Brexit. After a huge surge, the number of Labour Party members has dipped, and persuading activists to campaign has been tough in a winter election that few wanted. Back in 2017, success came partly from avoiding the bitterly divisive issue of Brexit and focusing instead on ending austerity and concentrating on core issues like health care. But with the Brexit saga reaching a critical point, Mr. Corbyn has struggled to shift the argument, at least until the last days of the campaign, when the fate of the National Health Service leapt into the headlines. Mr. Johnson has a snappy, if misleading, slogan — that he will “get Brexit done,” even though most analysts think it will take years to hammer out a new trade agreement with the European Union, not to speak of the United States. But Mr. Corbyn has been slow to call Mr. Johnson out, partly because Labour’s fuzzier Brexit policy was constructed to straddle internal divisions. Labour wants to negotiate a new exit deal with the European Union and put that to a referendum, with remain as the alternative and Mr. Corbyn staying neutral. At a news conference in London where Mr. Corbyn accused the Conservatives of misleading voters about their Brexit deal, a reporter asked him how he could make that claim when he himself refuses to say whether he would vote for or against Brexit in a second referendum. In contrast to their austere 2017 agenda, the Conservatives now promise more public spending, encouraging Labour to double down on its austerity-ending platform of 2017. That has opened Mr. Corbyn to accusations of irresponsible spending.  Professor Fielding thinks Labour did not expect the Tories to learn from their experience in 2017, and adds that Mr. Johnson, despite his flaws, is “not as bad as Theresa May; he’s a better candidate and armed with his clear ‘get Brexit done’ campaign motif.” “Jeremy Corbyn is no longer the new face on the block, that’s been and gone and you don’t come back from appalling approval ratings twice,” Professor Fielding said.  Laura Parker, the head of Momentum, a leftist group that supports Mr. Corbyn, counters that her 40,000 members have been more active than in 2017, that their videos have been viewed 65 million times and that anything is possible even if voters seem weary about politics. “There could be as many as six million people who have not yet decided how to vote,” she said. At the rally in Birmingham — an attempt to recreate the energy of the 2017 campaign — Mr. Corbyn talked without notes, preaching to the choir in a stump speech about soaking the rich and showering benefits on the less fortunate that he has been making for decades. Activists like Derick Johnson, an information technology expert, are delighted to hear a socialist, rather than a centrist, message from a Labour leader. “Everybody who listens to him likes him,” he said of Mr. Corbyn. If that is true, a lot of people are not listening. At the nearby bus station was Debbie Sexton, who once voted Labour but has switched to the Conservatives because of Brexit and Labour’s economic policy. “Where is all the money coming from?” she asked. The morning after his Birmingham rally, Mr. Corbyn was asked whether Labour might do better under someone else’s leadership. “I think Marmite is really good for you,” he replied, comparing himself to a salty British spread that divides opinion almost as much as Brexit itself. “Some people like it, some people don’t.” ']","The national polls put the Conservatives ahead, just as they did in 2017 when the left-wing Mr. Corbyn shocked the experts. But can he recapture that magic? "
9-Year-Old Prodigy Pulled From College Over Degree Delay,2019-12-11,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Until this week, Laurent Simons was on track to become the world’s youngest university graduate.  The 9-year-old Belgian prodigy was working on a brain-connected electrical chip for his final project at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, with the hope that he would complete his coursework and receive a diploma before he turned 10 on Dec. 26. It would have been a perfect Christmas gift, said his father, Alexander Simons, capping off a frenetic few years in which Laurent started primary school at age 4, went to high school at 6 and entered the university in Eindhoven at 9. But the plan went awry on Monday, when Laurent’s parents terminated his studies at the university over a dispute about the boy’s possible graduation date.  The university said in a statement that Mr. Simons had “repeated his explicit wish that his son should obtain his bachelor’s degree at the age of 9,” which the university considered not feasible given the exams he still needed to pass.  Mr. Simons rejected an offer in which Laurent would have graduated next year without a specific deadline, arguing that such a delay was unacceptable. The university had used his son “like a Christmas tree,” he said, a glittering ornament that made the institution shine. “He wasn’t making it,” the university spokesman, Ivo Jongsma, said about Laurent’s previous graduation plans. “But of course it wasn’t a problem for us,” he added. “He’s a genius; he would still have been one of the fastest ever” to graduate from a university. Laurent made international headlines last month when his parents publicized the news that he would graduate with a degree in electrical engineering by the end of the year. He had enrolled at the Eindhoven university in March, and his mentor there, Prof. Peter Baltus, said that Laurent was on track to finish a three-year program in just 10 months. “His absorption capacity is very high,” Professor Baltus said. In a phone interview last month, Laurent said he wanted to study medicine, get his doctorate and make artificial organs. He said he wanted to help people like his grandparents, whom he grew up with in the Netherlands while his parents worked in Belgium, and suffered from heart problems.  As Laurent’s potential graduation date came closer, his parents made him available for interviews and posted pictures on an Instagram account that gained tens of thousands of followers in a few weeks. “Busy Week With Interviews!! Building Up The Pressure! Soon Gigantic News!!,” a post read. But the university told Laurent’s parents that their son would need more time to complete his studies. On Friday, Mr. Simons organized a news conference in which he accused the Dutch institution of trying to delay Laurent’s plans to study for a Ph.D. at a “high-end” university in the United States.  “It’s like a bright soccer star who plays for P.S.V. Eindhoven,” Mr. Simons said, referring to the prominent Dutch soccer team, “and you get approached by Paris Saint-Germain,” he added about the top French club that has paid hundreds of millions to acquire a roster of stars in recent years. “You’re not going to say no.” It was unclear how Mr. Simons planned to have his son study for a doctorate without an undergraduate or even a master’s degree. He described Laurent as disappointed that he would not graduate this year. “Imagine how he feels,” he said. In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Simons also said that the Eindhoven university had done his son a disservice by moving back his graduation date, and having master’s students rather than full professors teach him recently.  University representatives denied any wrongdoing and said they had given special treatment to Laurent over the course of his study. “Of course he wasn’t abused,” said Mr. Jongsma, the spokesman, adding that officials had been “baffled” by the family’s behavior. “There has never been a student who has gotten so much attention as Laurent.” Mr. Simons said Laurent could soon start studying for a doctorate in electrical engineering in the United States, but refused to name an institution. Some “great news” would come before the end of the year, he added. Mr. Simons said about his son: “As we say here, high trees catch a lot of wind.”']",Laurent Simons made headlines last month when he was set to become the world’s youngest university graduate. But his parents now have other plans.
"Strikes Spread Across France for 6th Day, but Government Defends Its Pension Plans",2019-12-10,By Adam Nossiter and Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — The crowds of protesters taking to the streets of France on Tuesday to denounce President Emmanuel Macron’s bid to remake the pension system may have been smaller, but positions on both sides appeared as hardened as ever a day before the government was set to reveal the plan’s final details. Thousands of demonstrators marched across the Left Bank in Paris, spearheaded by unions experiencing a boost in strength after bringing nearly a million out on the streets a week ago. Still, the numbers Tuesday were down sharply all across France, according to the Interior Ministry, with under 350,000 over all, and just below 40,000 in Paris. Union leaders vowed to continue marching until the government withdraws its plan, while in Parliament, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe offered no hint that Mr. Macron might back down from his plan to merge the 42 different state-managed pension plans into a single system. Mr. Philippe, addressing the fears of many workers, promised that under the new plan, retirees’ “quality of life will not go down.” For Paris and its region, Tuesday was another day of transport chaos, the sixth in a row, as rail and subway workers continued striking. There were hundreds of miles of traffic jams, streets in Paris were thick with cars, and desperate commuters crammed into the few packed trains available. On the Rue des Archives in the Marais, Yateeha Krishan, a 27-year-old from Sri Lanka, had finished her morning shift cleaning offices and was wondering how to get home to her suburb northeast of Paris. Ms. Krishan, who had arrived at work 45 minutes late, is not paid if she does not make it in, she said. The economic effect of the strike is already visible. The pre-Christmas crowds on normally jam-packed shopping arteries like the Champs-Élysées are thin. And hotelkeepers complained of canceled bookings, empty rooms and a precipitous drop in revenues over the weekend in a city heavily dependent on tourism. Plays and operas were canceled. Paris Opera dancers are among those most strongly opposed to the pension overhaul, because they fear losing a special retirement program that takes into account the grueling physical requirements of their jobs. Dock workers in port cities like Rouen and Marseille were also protesting on Tuesday, several universities remained closed and strikers blocked seven of France’s eight oil refineries. The unions offered no regrets for the commuter and business woes, pointing to high levels of public support for the strike. The French appear more anxious over what they see as a threat to their retirements than over the effects of the strike. “Given the level of discontent, we have to remain mobilized,” Philippe Martinez, the secretary general of the far-left General Confederation of Labor, told reporters before the start of Tuesday’s march. He said, “The more numerous we are, the quicker the government will withdraw its project.” In Parliament, Prime Minister Philippe merely reiterated the government’s goal: “To build a single unitary retirement system in France.” He added words that alarm many of his countrymen. “We’ve got to tell the French the truth,” he said, “and say it calmly: This is going to occur through a gradual lengthening of working life.” The official retirement age in France is 62, already among the lowest in the industrialized world, but many retire even earlier. In a closed-door meeting before the parliamentary session, Mr. Philippe warned his party’s lawmakers that there would be “no magic announcements” that would suddenly stop the strikes. In an op-ed article in Le Monde on Tuesday, four economists who helped Mr. Macron shape his economic platform during the 2017 electoral campaign urged him to reassure the French about the stability of the points-based pension system he is proposing. Under the proposed government plan, points accumulated during working life would be cashed in at retirement. Whether they could fluctuate in value is unknown. But the demonstrators and the hardest-line unions have no interest in a point system. They simply want to keep the current system, which Mr. Martinez has called “the best in the world.” The atmosphere at the marches Tuesday was generally peaceful, and sometimes even festive. The protests drew a broad coalition of transport and health care workers, teachers and students, all concerned about their retirement checks. “There are whole professions that are extremely angry,” said Mourad Lafitte, a printers’ union worker, as the demonstration in Paris got underway outside the gold-domed church at Invalides, where Napoleon is buried. “Everybody has had it up to here.” Nearby, a hospital worker wore mock scrubs with the words “Macron, we want beds!” A “Revolutionary Left” stand distributing buttons and fliers was emblazoned with the slogan “Macron get lost!” “The discontent is very deep,” said François Sikirdji, a retired music teacher. “Going on strike is not easy. I lost a third of my purchasing power when I retired.” Union sound trucks blared disconnected fragments of speeches by Mr. Macron against a thumping bass. Sinister images of the French leader, emerging from flames or brandishing pistols against the words “Our rights, burned and pillaged!” or “Macron, agent of the CAC 40” — the French equivalent of the Dow Jones average — were plastered on the vehicles. Sacks of baguettes to feed the protesters were piled on tables, and union workers cleaned a big electric grill. Lunch for the demonstrators would not be forgotten. And France has not completely shut down. Factories and businesses are running, cafes and restaurants are open, and public transportation in some cities is functioning almost normally.

His government showed no sign of backing down.
"With France in Uproar Over Pensions, Macron May Need One Early",2019-12-09,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — With his country in turmoil, more chaos looming and no resolution in sight, President Emmanuel Macron of France tried changing the subject. Last Thursday, nearly a million people had taken to the streets to protest his plan to remake France’s uniquely generous pension system. But a day later, Mr. Macron, instead of addressing what was on everyone’s minds — how to get out of the standoff, which has stranded thousands of commuters — delivered a lyrical tribute far from Paris to three rescue workers killed in a helicopter crash. That Olympian silence on the immediate issue of the day encapsulated Mr. Macron’s challenge as a reformer, past, present and future, in the view of some analysts. The French president sold himself to voters as a nonpolitician, but that credential has come back to haunt him. His own party criticizes what many call his maladroit communication on an anxiety-inducing subject. Now, some within the party are predicting a rough road ahead for the man who promised his country a “revolution” in a campaign manifesto of that name. His citizens turned out to have a revolution of their own in mind — one that, like so many in France’s past, is bubbling up from the streets. More strikes and demonstrations were planned for Tuesday, after the government met through the weekend to refine the details of the pension-streamlining plan. On Monday, commuters woke to more chaos, with 14 out of 16 metro lines shut down in Paris, most trains across the country canceled and traffic backed up for miles around Paris. The unions are preparing for a long fight. Mr. Macron may now may be running out of space and time to deliver his own cerebral version of the revolution. “The reform possibility of this government is weakened,” said Gérard Grunberg, a veteran political scientist at Sciences Po, the international research university. Mr. Macron has tried to nudge France toward a closer embrace of market forces — loosening up rules for hiring and firing, for example — and has reduced the unemployment rate from over 9 percent to around 8 percent. But this has not widened his circle of support: barely a third of the French approve of him. And his latest initiative may further erode his popularity. “He seems absolutely incapable of expanding his political and social base,” said Mr. Grunberg. “He’s only supported by the little quarter who support what he represents ideologically. I don’t see him regaining popularity. It’s a big weakness.” Mr. Macron insists that the new pension plan, which aims to simplify the country’s current 42 systems into one points-based system, will be fairer. “It’s to unite, in a single system,” Mr. Macron said at a town-hall meeting in October. “And whatever your field of work, each point you save, that you ‘buy,’ it will give you exactly the same rights when you reach retirement.”  On Wednesday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will present what is supposed to be the plan’s final draft. Apart from the huge cost, there is little doubt the current system works well for many. In France the poverty rate among those older than 65 is less than 5 percent, largely because of the pension system, while in the United States it approaches 20 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In France, life expectancy is increasing, while in the United States it is diminishing in significant sectors of the population. With public opinion behind the strikers, and the unions emboldened by their success, the margin for maneuvering by the government appears limited. Fifty-three percent backed the strikers in a poll published Sunday in Le Journal du Dimanche. Mr. Macron’s political learning on the job has not helped. Even some of his own supporters are starting to get anxious. “We absolutely must remove the uncertainties for the French, that this reform won’t have a negative impact on their pensions,” said Benoît Simian, a member of Parliament from Mr. Macron’s party who represents an area around Bordeaux. The standoff, he said, “hurts the reformist capacity of the government, which is a necessity for our future. Clearly, this could put a wrench in our ability to reform.”  The lack of clarity over who, if anybody, will win and lose in the new pension system has opened a door for Mr. Macron’s hitherto weak political opposition and for the unions. Some analysts say private-sector workers will come out ahead. That prediction has enraged the public sector. “They decided, all by themselves, to create a revolution in the pensions system,” the leftist opposition leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon told journalists in Marseille last week. “It’s a real provocation to our welfare state.” At a union demonstration this weekend in Paris against the pension changes, protesters made clear who their target was. “Stop Macron and his government and their reactionary program!” an organizer yelled through a microphone on a chilly plaza in front of the Montparnasse railway station, normally busy but now virtually emptied. “This movement goes way beyond just pensions,” said Fabrice Angei, an official with the leftist CGT union, shouting above the union anthems blaring from the loudspeakers. “Mr. Macron is the representative of the free-marketers, of Thatcher, and that is being contested all over the world,” Mr. Angei said. “And he is an anachronism in relation to this revolt against inequality and the authoritarian state.”   Olivier Thily, a railway worker at the demonstration, said: “We’re hoping that they will back down. Anyway, this is only the beginning.” The pension standoff may have highlighted Mr. Macron’s vulnerabilities as a reformer, but it has also shown his determination to proceed regardless of warnings from history. Nearly 25 years ago, the government of one of his mentors, Alain Juppé, was fatally weakened by a similar effort to streamline the pension systems. After a general transport strike lasting nearly a month, Mr. Juppé — often accused of the same kind of high-minded imperiousness as Mr. Macron — was forced to back down. A year-and-a-half later Mr. Juppé’s government collapsed. Mr. Macron already faced a near-death experience for his government because of protests last year by the Yellow Vest movement. They were tamed with a massive infusion of cash, fierce police repression and days of presidential palaver. “What we’re seeing is that, with considerable courage, Macron is attacking, like no one before, the systematic reform of the pensions system,” said Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist. He said, “Every time anybody has tried to do this, there’s been huge social mobilization, because the whole subject is so anxiety-provoking.” Mr. Macron’s advisers say he understands the risks. “He’s not losing his cool, and he’s totally prepared,” said Ismaël Emelien, a longtime aide to Mr. Macron who is now in the private sector but still counsels the president.  “He knows that this reform is complicated, and that reforming pensions is the hardest one of all,” Mr. Emelien said. “It revives lots of bad memories for the French.”  Public opinion appears to be on the other side. “I completely support the cause,” said Anais de Matos, a freelance videographer, who said the strike “doesn’t bother me at all — I think it’s great.” “We can’t go back,” Ms. de Matos said. “It isn’t that we need to take some privileges from some people, but that we need to extend those privileges to others.” Melissa Godin contributed reporting.']",A standoff over the president’s plan to simplify a generous retirement system raises doubts about his ability to change France. 
"Indian Parliament Passes Divisive Citizenship Bill, Moving It Closer to Law",2019-12-11,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj,"['NEW DELHI — The upper house of the Indian Parliament passed a contentious citizenship bill on Wednesday, bringing a religiously polarizing measure one step closer to law as new protests erupted across the country.The measure, called the Citizenship Amendment Bill, uses religion as a criterion for determining whether illegal migrants in India can be fast-tracked for citizenship. The bill favors members of all South Asia’s major religions except Islam, and leaders of India’s 200-million-strong Muslim community have called it blatant discrimination. The Rajya Sabha, India’s version of a senate, approved the bill in a 125-to-105 vote. It next goes to the president’s desk, where it is expected to be signed into law in the coming days. Opponents of the legislation in India and international rights groups have called the bill a major blow to India’s long-held commitment to a secular democracy. Officials in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government have insisted that the legislation would protect human rights. [Update: Modi urges calm as New Delhi violence rages for third day.] “The bill provides expedited consideration for Indian citizenship to persecuted religious minorities already in India from certain contiguous countries,” said Raveesh Kumar, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. “It seeks to address their current difficulties and meet their basic human rights. Such an initiative should be welcomed, not criticized by those who are genuinely committed to religious freedom.”  The bill is a central piece of a far-reaching agenda by Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, which has long espoused a Hindu-centric worldview.  India is around 80 percent Hindu, with a large Muslim minority, and many of Mr. Modi’s supporters believe India should emphasize its Hindu identity as much as possible and become more of an overtly Hindu nation. India’s founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, resisted this, insisting on keeping India a secular state and carving out special protections for minorities, including Muslims.  Mr. Modi is popular and powerful, and his political party is one of the most dominant forces that India has produced in decades. Still, it has plenty of detractors, and protests over the bill have grown bigger and more violent throughout the week.  Late Wednesday, the Indian government shut down the internet in many districts in the state of Assam and called up the army in other areas to quell the chaos. The police were already battling demonstrators with water cannons and tear gas.  Protests have broken out in Aligarh, Bhopal, Deoband, Jaipur and several cities in the northeast, where the bill could have the largest effect by allowing Hindu migrants to settle legally in areas where locals have expressed anti-migrant sentiments.  The Indian government has promised to protect indigenous rights in these areas, but that has failed to quash suspicions or resentments. More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the heart of Assam’s commercial capital, Guwahati, yelling: “Go Back Modi!” In other places, angry men set fire to tires and stomped on effigies of Mr. Modi.  As the protests spread, many people debated what kind of country India should be. “The idea of India that emerged from the independence movement,” said a letter signed by more than 1,000 Indian intellectuals, “is that of a country that aspires to treat people of all faiths equally.” But this bill, the intellectuals said, is “a radical break with this history” and will “greatly strain the pluralistic fabric of the country."" The citizenship legislation, which passed through the lower house of Parliament on Monday, follows hand in hand with a divisive citizenship test conducted this summer in one of India’s states and possibly soon to be expanded nationwide.  All residents of the state of Assam, along the Bangladesh border, had to produce documentary proof that they or their ancestors had lived in India since 1971. Around two million of Assam’s population of 33 million — a mix of Hindus and Muslims — failed to pass the test, and these people now risk being rendered stateless. Huge new prisons are being built to incarcerate anyone determined to be an illegal immigrant.  Some of those who have been arrested have lived in India for generations.  The citizenship bill would allow Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsees or Jains who have migrated from Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan a clear path to naturalization in India.  Migrants who are Muslim — which might include people who have lived in India for generations but were unable to produce an old property deed or birth certificate to prove it — would not be afforded the same protection.  The bill excludes Muslim members of religious minorities from neighboring countries, such as the Rohingya who have been persecuted ruthlessly in neighboring Myanmar.  International organizations have seized on that in criticizing the legislation. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal body, called the measure a “dangerous turn in the wrong direction” and said that the United States should consider sanctions against India if the bill passes. Indian officials and other supporters of the bill cite attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all of which are predominantly Muslim, and the shrinking Hindu populations in those countries. Kanwal Sibal, a former foreign secretary and a supporter of Mr. Modi’s foreign policy, said the bill “certainly expresses a pro-Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist sentiment for objective reasons as they are a beleaguered community with no other option.” But, he said, the citizenship bill has “nothing to do with the Muslims of India. It relates to foreign Muslims who have infiltrated into India over the years."" The big question many Muslims in India are now asking is: Who will be considered an Indian citizen? And who will be considered an illegal foreigner?  Many of the people who failed to pass the citizenship test in Assam had lived in India all their lives, felt deeply Indian and were despondent to be stricken from the citizenship rolls. Some even killed themselves, including a 14-year-old girl from a small village.  Where all of this is going is hardly clear. Even if India rounds up thousands of people the government considers illegal migrants and puts them into the newly built prisons, it will not be easy to deport them.  Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan will be unlikely to accept India’s determination of citizenship, especially if it seems that most of those being slated for removal are Muslims.  India’s home minister, Amit Shah, considered the second most powerful man in the country, has vowed two things: to bring the citizenship tests nationwide and to protect Hindus knocked off the citizenship rolls. Harsh Mander, a well-known human rights defender, said in a newspaper column that these measures posed “the gravest threat to India’s secular democratic constitution since India became a republic.” Mr. Mander, who said he was born a Sikh, said that if the bill passed he would declare himself a Muslim to stand in solidarity with “my undocumented Muslim sisters and brothers.""']","The government says it is trying to protect religious minorities from being persecuted in Muslim countries. Indian Muslims say the bill is discriminatory, and protests are spreading."
Taliban Attack U.S. Base in Afghanistan as Negotiators Talk Peace,2019-12-11,By Fahim Abed and Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — As their negotiators resumed peace talks with American diplomats, Taliban militants on Wednesday set off a car bomb and penetrated a medical facility attached to Bagram Air Base, the largest United States military base in Afghanistan, killing at least two people and wounding at least 73, officials said. The daring attack on the base — which President Trump visited recently — lasted nearly 12 hours after the initial explosion, and it was bound to complicate the negotiations. After a year of talks, the two sides had been on the verge of announcing an agreement in September when President Trump called off the negotiations, citing a Taliban bombing that killed an American, a NATO soldier and nearly a dozen Afghans.  In the attack on Wednesday, a vehicle laden with explosives targeted the southern part of the base, the site of a medical facility that was under construction. Several attackers then entered the base, engaging in a firefight with Afghan and coalition forces, Afghan officials said.  Soon after the initial attack, a spokesman for the American-led NATO mission said the assault had been repelled. But later Wednesday, nearly 10 hours after the first explosion, the spokesman said that some fighters were still holed up in the medical facility. He said the medical facility had been badly damaged, but he insisted the air base defenses were not breached. Reports about casualties to coalition forces were conflicting. Initially, the NATO mission’s spokesman said coalition forces had suffered no casualties. In a later update, he said “some service members have been evaluated for minor injuries as a result of the initial attack,” but that there were no major injuries. The Georgian Defense Ministry said that five Georgian soldiers who are part of the coalition had suffered minor injuries. Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, said two civilians were killed and at least 73 others were wounded. By 8 p.m. local time, more than 12 hours after the attack began, all seven assailants were dead, he said.  “Houses were damaged as far as 200 meters from the scene of the explosion,” Mr. Rahimi said. Talks between the chief American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, and Taliban negotiators have been underway in recent days in Qatar after they were restarted by Mr. Trump in November. Officials say that both sides are talking about ways to decrease violence, reach a possible cease-fire and pave the way for talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Although both sides have engaged in violence across Afghanistan during this year’s negotiations, it was an increase in Taliban attacks just before an expected announcement of a peace agreement deal that President Trump cited for calling off the peace talks. During the three-month halt in talks, Western diplomats hoped the Taliban would return to the table with a realization that they had pushed their hand too far with the violence.  Wednesday’s attack, during the fifth day of the new talks, could cast doubt on the group’s intentions and raise new concerns that the Taliban’s political wing and the military side might not agree on how to end the 18-year conflict.

Saudi Family of Pensacola Gunman: ‘Even We Don’t Know the Truth’ of Motive,2019-12-11,By Vivian Yee,"['AL AHSA, Saudi Arabia — Not long before a 21-year-old Saudi Royal Air Force trainee shot and killed three American sailors on Friday at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., he called his mother and his brother back home. The trainee, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was wearing his uniform, they could see on the video call — the uniform he had always wanted to wear as a child, when he dreamed of becoming a pilot.  With his elder brother, Abdullah, he joked around on the call: “You’re the eldest,” Lieutenant Alshamrani teased, “but I’m going to get married first.” Talking to his mother, he promised he would be home as soon as he finished his training. “Just a few more months,” he said. What was missing was any hint of what was to come: opening fire in a classroom building at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, shooting three fatally and wounding eight more before being killed by a sheriff’s deputy.  Lieutenant Alshamrani seemed utterly normal in that last conversation, his family insisted in interviews this week in Saudi Arabia. Four days later, they are still baffled. “He never had a secret. He was never hiding anything,” Saeed Abdullah Alshamrani, 55, the lieutenant’s father, said  at the family’s home in eastern Saudi Arabia on Tuesday evening. “It’s such a mystery. Even we don’t know the truth.” “Are you sure he’s dead?” his father asked during the interview, surrounded by several relatives, acquaintances and others whose relationship to the family was not clear. “We haven’t even been given any proof of whether he’s dead or alive.” No motive for the shooting has been determined, although the F.B.I. is treating it as a presumed terrorist attack. The Pentagon announced on Tuesday that it was suspending operational training for all of the nearly 900 Saudi military students in the United States. Among the few clues to emerge was a tweet from an account that may be connected to Lieutenant Alshamrani and that condemned United States foreign policy decisions in the Middle East, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. There was also a complaint the lieutenant filed this year against one of his instructors for mocking his mustache in class. But in Saudi Arabia, the American focus on  possible radicalization has left family and acquaintances bewildered, forced to answer for their son and friend to other Saudis.  Sensitive to Western stereotypes that often reflexively brand Muslims as terrorists, and aware that the kingdom cannot afford to lose Washington’s support, many Saudis have been eager to portray the lieutenant as a monstrous outlier. A hashtag declaring that he “does not represent” Saudis has dominated Twitter in the kingdom, and the news media has echoed the point. “This work can only be done by a cowardly villain,” wrote Hamdan Al-Shehri, a political scientist, in the Arab News, a Saudi newspaper. “He has betrayed his country, which trusted him and spent millions on his education. Instead, he stabbed her in the back.” The Saudi government is also extremely sensitive about the case, fearing that it could jeopardize a relationship already frayed by criticism in Washington over the war in Yemen and the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other top officials have all condemned the shooting. Lieutenant Alshamrani’s family have said they were questioned by government officials. In interviews, his father, brother, cousins and a family friend said that Lieutenant Alshamrani had always seemed content to be in the United States, working toward his longtime goal, never mentioning difficulties. “Since he was a kid, he’d dreamed of being a pilot, and he worked so hard for it,” said his brother, Abdullah Alshamrani. Once he arrived in the United States, “he loved it so much, really,” his brother said. “He was amazed by America’s military force, just really impressed by the military.” The third child in a family from Tabalah, a farming town in southern Saudi Arabia, Lieutenant Alshamrani grew up in Al Ahsa, not far from the Saudi Aramco compound in eastern Saudi Arabia. His father had moved there to work in the local airport, eventually rising to be a security official. The family spent summers with extended family back in Tabalah, with its date farms nestled amid the undulating desert and stark mountains. They built another house there and frequently came back for weddings and other family events. On summer evenings, with other entertainment scarce, young men like Lieutenant Alshamrani and his brothers and cousins would gather at rented guesthouses in the desert to play cards and watch soccer on television late into the night. Lieutenant Alshamrani always seemed more serious and less boisterous than the other young men, recalled Galat bin Mitshoosh, a retired longtime detective with the local prosecutor’s office in Tabalah who knows the family. “I never heard anything political from Mohammed,” he said. “He was quiet, just a normal guy. He might talk about sports sometimes.” The Alshamranis were observant Muslims who prayed, he said, but their practice of Islam was not considered especially strict. A person familiar with the investigation in the United States has said that friends and classmates told investigators that Lieutenant Alshamrani seemed to have become more religious when he returned from his last visit home in February. During that visit, relatives said, he took his mother to the holy city of Mecca to perform the umrah, a type of pilgrimage that many Muslims routinely undertake. In his relatives’ eyes, however, they said there was nothing to indicate his Islamic beliefs had changed or hardened. He did not seem different, they said, except that he had shaven his chin clean. Always a good student, Lieutenant Alshamrani cemented his place as the pride of his family when he became one of the two students picked from his air force academy class of several hundred to enter the training program in the United States on a scholarship. Saudi Arabia has sent hundreds of thousands of young students overseas to study in Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States in recent years, but it was so rare for someone from rural Tabalah to study in the United States that the last young man from the town to do so before Lieutenant Alshamrani is locally famous. “I was so proud of him. He’s the role model of the family,” his brother Abdullah said. “I’m the eldest son, but Mohammed is a big deal.” Starting in August 2017, the Saudi government paid for him to spend a year learning English at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio before he moved to Pensacola for military training. He had already received weapons training at his academy in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, the family said. But he did not appear to acquire a gun in the United States until July, when he legally purchased a Glock 45 9-millimeter handgun in late July, shortly after obtaining a state hunting license, the F.B.I. said on Tuesday. Over his years in the United States, he shared with his family pictures of himself smiling in Times Square and in uniform with one of his American trainers.  A video he took in Florida showed friends splashing around in kayaks, as he laughed behind the camera. When he called home — almost every day, his father and brother said — he talked about traveling around the United States, hanging out with his Saudi roommate and coming home after graduation. He was counting down the months. So was his family. His father had told neighbors and friends in Tabalah that he would throw a huge graduation party for his son when the family visited next summer, according to Mr. bin Mitshoosh, the retired detective. All of the men from the town’s six tribes would be invited. When he called his family on Friday, Lieutenant Alshamrani offered to send his brother some extra money. He promised to be home soon. “I’ll call you later,” he told Abdullah.  Only hours later, that night, would they learn the news.

Who’s Spreading Disinformation in U.K. Election? You Might Be Surprised,2019-12-10,By Adam Satariano and Amie Tsang,"['LONDON — Manipulated Twitter accounts, doctored videos, dodgy websites and questions of foreign meddling. In just six weeks, the campaign leading up to Britain’s general election this Thursday, one of its most important votes in a generation, has had a taste of what the dark arts of online campaigning have to offer. Some material has originated with shadowy groups or Russian operatives, but a surprising amount of questionable online behavior has come from the political parties and candidates themselves. Last month, the Conservative Party apologized after spreading a video edited to make it look as though the opposition Labour lawmaker in charge of the party’s Brexit policy could not answer a question about exiting the European Union.  It then dressed up one of its Twitter accounts to look like a nonpartisan fact-check group, drawing a warning from Twitter. Later, Conservatives bought ads on Google so that in searches for Labour’s policy manifesto, the top result was a website that criticized the proposals.  The Labour Party, too, has been tied to the spread of misleading information. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, cited documents that suggested the Conservative Party would weaken the National Health Service in a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States. The documents turned out to be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.  The use of disinformation techniques by political leaders, particularly the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, reflects an evolution in how the internet is being used to grab attention, distract the news media, stoke outrage and rally support.  It is not just professionals who are creating false or misleading campaign material online. Just about anyone can put it together, and that is exactly what seems to be happening.  “It’s the democratization of misinformation,” said Jacob Davey, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based group that tracks global disinformation campaigns. “We’re seeing anyone and everyone picking up these tactics.” Polls suggest that voters are shrugging off accusations of online trickery, as Facebook has said it will not screen political ads for accuracy. Experts said this means the tactics were likely to further enter the mainstream in Britain and elsewhere.  “This is the election where disinformation was normalized,” Mr. Davey said. “A few years ago people were looking for a massive coordinated campaign from a hostile state actor. Now, many more actors are getting involved.” Britain’s election provides an imperfect comparison to the upcoming presidential election in the United States, where the process lasts more than a year and the campaigns are better funded and more digitally sophisticated.  But the experience in Britain offers a preview of the unruly online battle brewing across the Atlantic, as those seeking to influence voters become more cunning about reaching people through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and WhatsApp. The disinformation campaigns seen in the British election appear designed to be easily discovered, provoke outrage and distract the news media, said Jenni Sargent, the managing director of First Draft, a nonprofit group that investigates online misinformation.  She said that whenever journalists questioned Conservative Party representatives about the questionable tactics, they used the opportunity to criticize opponents in the Labour Party. Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute who tracks social media use in the British election, said it was worrying that mainstream campaigns were so involved.  “It’s about winning at any price,” she said. “The difficulty is so much of this is legal. Much of it is just falling through the gaps of the law.” The Conservative Party, which did not respond to requests for comment, bolstered its online operation by adding Sean Topham and Ben Guerin, political consultants in their 20s from New Zealand. Their digital skills helped fuel Scott Morrison’s surprise victory as prime minister of Australia last year.  They also gained attention for “boomer memes” — low-quality, scrappily produced ads that reiterate simple messages by pasting them onto images from popular shows like “Game of Thrones.” Their approach is to find ways to attract attention to their clients, whether candidates or parties, by pushing emotional buttons that elicit a response online.  “We’re talking anger, excitement, pride, fear,” Mr. Guerin said at a conference in June. “Your content should be relating to one of these emotions for anyone to give a damn about it.” He described the strategy as “How do you win the battle of the thumbs?” Still, disinformation’s overall influence on voters is far from clear. Researchers have struggled to precisely measure how much people are swayed by what they see in their social media feeds.  In Wigan, a longtime Labour stronghold in northwestern England where the Conservatives have been trying to capitalize on strong pro-Brexit sentiments, newspapers and television remain a common way for many people to get information. But for others, like Greg Rimmer, a 26-year-old who works for the local government, everything comes from social media. Pulling out his phone, he scrolled through a Twitter feed filled with political posts criticizing the Conservative Party’s health care plans. He tapped over to Facebook, where he saw another meme about the election. “I hardly ever watch the news, but I’m on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube all the time,” he said. “I try not to let it sway me, but if you see something constantly, you can’t help it.” Many videos shared on Facebook and in WhatsApp groups around the country originate in a cramped office in the northern London neighborhood of Finsbury Park. Emil Charlaff, who helps lead that effort at Momentum, a pro-Labour group, said social media played a critical role in building support and organizing voters.  The group has about 15 people who produce videos, memes and other social media content, often using humor or outrage to grab attention. “People are so saturated, you need to grab their attention in the first three seconds,” said Mr. Charlaff, who said Momentum did not knowingly publish any false information. Britain’s election is the first major campaign since Facebook said it would not fact-check political ads from candidates and political parties. Sam Jeffers, a co-founder of Who Targets Me, a group that tracks Facebook political advertising, said that since then, there had not been the flood of disinformation that many had feared. Yet he said there were a lot of misleading online ads, some from new outside groups whose financial backers are not always clear to the public. As of Dec. 5, no party or candidate in Britain had spent more than 750,000 pounds (about $1 million) on Facebook ads during the campaign, far below what candidates in the United States typically spend.  Yet Mr. Davey of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the group that tracks global disinformation, said posts spread among Facebook users were just as big a problem as political ads. The British election, he said, highlights the widening use of techniques to manipulate social media by candidates, parties, activist groups and individuals around the world.  With few rules around internet campaigns, Mr. Davey said, it is hard for voters to know what content is legitimate and where the material originates. There have been several recent examples where information originating from questionable sources online reached the mainstream. In a TV interview on Monday, Mr. Johnson was caught in a gaffe, refusing to look at a picture of a sick 4-year old lying on a hospital floor because of a lack of beds. It was an implicit criticism of the Conservatives for having starved the health system of funding. By Tuesday, an effort was underway online to discredit the child’s family, and a false statement claiming the episode was staged was widely shared on Facebook and Twitter — even though the hospital said the case was true and issued an official apology.  The document that Mr. Corbyn cited to support the argument that post-Brexit, the Conservative Party would weaken the National Health Service in a trade deal with the United States, was posted on the online forum Reddit. It purported to be a leaked copy of a secret trade document between Britain and the United States. Last week, Reddit said the document had links to the Russian disinformation campaign, raising fresh questions about foreign interference in the campaign, though the document itself seemed to be accurate.  In another effort discovered by researchers, anti-Muslim messages were shared in WhatsApp groups and Twitter in an effort to sway Hindu voters in Britain to vote against Labour.  And after the stabbing near London Bridge last month, false information was circulated in Labour-supporting Facebook groups that the killing had been a “false flag” staged to support the Conservative Party. Perhaps the strangest incident came when an online forum spread a false rumor that Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats party, enjoyed hunting squirrels.  First Draft, the group that investigates online misinformation, traced how the rumor had spread from a fake news clip doctored to look as if it had come from the Daily Mirror newspaper. As the rumor spread online, Ms. Swinson was asked in a radio interview whether she hunted squirrels, leading to newspaper headlines like “Jo Swinson Denies Firing Stones at Squirrels.” All of this leads to one thing, said Ms. Sargent of First Draft: “It’s this gentle erosion of trust.” ']","Foreign meddling was once the most feared source of online deception before critical elections.

Nobel Peace Laureate Says Social Media Sows Hate in Ethiopia,2019-12-10,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['[View the latest updates to the 2020 Nobel Prize winners list.] NAIROBI, Kenya — Ethiopia’s prime minister Abiy Ahmed warned in his speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Tuesday that social media is now being used to sow “hate and division” and undermine Ethiopia’s delicate political transition.  As he accepted a Nobel Peace Prize for ending a long war between his country and neighboring Eritrea in the Horn of Africa, Mr. Abiy said that digital platforms are sabotaging the development of an “inclusive” political atmosphere in Ethiopia. Mr. Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the end to the long-running border dispute with Eritrea and for ushering in a new era of diplomatic and trade relations. The Nobel committee also acknowledged the significant economic and political changes that he has introduced in Ethiopia since ascending to power.  Speaking at an ornate chamber at the Oslo City Hall before an audience of royals, dignitaries, and family members, Mr. Abiy did not specify which social media platforms were being used to sow discord or who was using them.  However, one of Mr. Abiy’s most vocal critics, Jawar Mohammed, has a large social media presence and commands a media network that he has used to organize opposition to Mr. Abiy. Less than 20 percent of Ethiopia’s more than 109 million people were using the internet as of 2018, according to the International Telecommunication Union.  “The evangelists of hate and division are wreaking havoc in our society using social media,” Mr. Abiy said. “They are preaching the gospel of revenge and retribution on the airwaves.”  Mr. Abiy rose to power in April 2018, after years of deadly anti-government protests that forced his predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn to resign. Beginning in 2015, members of marginalized ethnic groups rose up against the ruling party, demanding land reform, an end to human rights abuses and full political participation. The government responded by shooting at protesters, imposing a state of emergency and cutting off internet access. During those blackouts, members of Ethiopia’s diaspora used social media to amplify news of the crackdown, eventually pushing the ruling party to put forward Mr. Abiy, a political insider who is of mixed religious and ethnic background, to lead the country.  Mr. Abiy, 43, has preached the philosophy of “medemer,” or unity, and has made peaceful coexistence and regional integration a central leitmotif of his administration. Under his leadership, Ethiopia has announced plans to liberalize its centralized economy and loosen the state’s monopoly on sectors including aviation and telecommunications. Mr. Abiy also released thousands of political prisoners, legalized opposition groups long classified as terrorists and pledged to revise and repeal repressive laws. Despite this, his efforts to open up Ethiopia have also emboldened forces that could undermine not just his own rule but the country’s long-term stability. Dozens of people have been killed in growing unrest in the country, while more than 3 million people remain internally displaced because of ethnic and border-related disputes. Mr. Abiy himself survived a grenade attack last year, and an attempted coup in the northern Amhara region in June revealed the restive political atmosphere brewing in the country ahead of the country’s next election, in 2020.  Mr. Abiy’s administration, however, bears some responsibility. It has recently faced censure over its recourse to tactics including arresting journalists and blocking the internet. On Monday, the Nobel Committee voiced its disappointment with Mr. Abiy after he indicated that he would refuse to take questions from the media while collecting his prize. In Oslo, Mr. Abiy drew on his personal experiences as a soldier in the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict to deliver a speech deriding the futility of war and extolling the virtues of peace. He called on Ethiopians to “neutralize the toxin of hatred by creating a civic culture of consensus-based democracy, inclusivity, civility, and tolerance.”']",Ethiopia’s prime minister Abiy Ahmed warned against the “gospel of revenge and retribution” as he accepted the Nobel Prize in Oslo.
China Displaces Turkey as Top Jailer of Journalists in 2019,2019-12-11,By Rick Gladstone,"['China nudged past Turkey as the leading jailer of journalists this year, a press advocacy group reported in its annual survey, partly because of severe repression in China’s Xinjiang region and Turkey’s eradication of “virtually all independent reporting,” which has left many reporters unemployed, driven into exile or intimidated into self-censorship. The survey, released Wednesday by the Committee to Protect Journalists, also found that authoritarianism, instability and protests in the Middle East had led to a sharp rise in the number of journalists incarcerated in that region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt now share the rank of third-worst jailer of journalists, the group said. For the fourth consecutive year, at least 250 journalists were imprisoned around the world, the group said in a news release announcing the findings. It said President Xi Jinping of China, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt had shown “no sign of letting up on the critical media.” It was the first time in four years that Turkey had not claimed the dubious title in the group’s survey, as the number of journalists incarcerated there fell to 47 from 68 in 2018. But the group said the reduction did “not signal an improved situation for the Turkish media.” Rather, the group said, the reduction reflected the successful drive by Mr. Erdogan to “stamp out independent reporting,” with actions that included the closing of more than 100 news outlets. Scores of journalists are now in exile, jobless or too frightened to report on topics the Turkish government finds objectionable, the group said.  Other journalists who had been held in Turkish jails have been freed, because of shortened pretrial detention periods under new laws that grant appeals for convictions of offenses such as “propaganda for a terrorist organization,” which the group described as a frequent charge against journalists in Turkey. “Dozens of journalists not currently jailed in Turkey are still facing trial or appeal and could yet be sentenced to prison,” the group said, while “others have been sentenced in absentia and face arrest if they return to the country.” In China, at least 48 journalists are incarcerated, one more than in 2018, the group said, as Mr. Xi has “instituted ever tighter controls on the media.” A crackdown in Xinjiang, where a million members of Muslim ethnic groups have been sent to internment camps, has led to the arrests of “dozens of journalists,” the group said, including some incarcerated for work they had done years ago. In Saudi Arabia, where the number of imprisoned journalists has risen steadily for years, at least 26 are being held, the group said, the same as the number imprisoned in Egypt. In 18 of the Saudi cases, the group said, the charges have not been disclosed. The group found 16 journalists held in the reclusive sub-Saharan nation of Eritrea, including some who had not been heard from in nearly two decades. Other countries on the group’s top jailers list include Vietnam, with 12 imprisoned journalists; Iran, with 11; Russia and Cameroon, with seven each; Bahrain and Azerbaijan, with six each; Syria with five; and Burundi, Rwanda and Morocco, with four each.  The group said it also had revised its 2018 list to 255 from 251, having belatedly learned of arrests, releases or deaths it had not known of a year ago.  The list is a snapshot of those incarcerated as of Dec. 1, and excludes the many journalists who are seized by the authorities and released throughout the year. Based in New York, the Committee to Protect Journalists is a leading proponent of press freedom, and its advocacy work has helped lead to early release of at least 80 imprisoned journalists this past year.  ']","In its annual survey, the Committee to Protect Journalists found that at least 250 journalists are imprisoned around the world, largely by authoritarian leaders. "
"France’s Pension Changes Won’t Affect Older Workers, Prime Minister Vows",2019-12-11,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Hoping to tamp down the transport strikes that are choking France, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe promised in a much-anticipated speech on Wednesday that the government’s planned pension overhaul would not affect older workers and would have a limited effect on those now in midcareer. But he again angered the unions on a crucial point — pushing the French to work longer — raising doubts about an early end to the strikes, which have also hit schools and government services, and setting up a possible prolonged battle between workers and the government of President Emmanuel Macron.  Mr. Philippe, the president’s stoic frontman for the pension plan, said that through incentives and penalties, the French would be encouraged to work until 64, past the legal retirement age, 62, one of the lowest in Europe. He also made concessions on the start date of the changes, which would go into effect in 2022, but only progressively, and at an even slower pace for those, like railway workers, who are currently in “special” retirement schemes. But the new age target was too much for a critical moderate union, the French Democratic Confederation of Labor,  or C.F.D.T., whose support the government needs and which had held back from the strikes.  “The red line has been crossed,” said Laurent Berger, secretary general of the C.F.D.T. Union.  The militant leftist General Confederation of Labor, or C.G.T. Union, which has spearheaded the strikes, struck an even harsher tone, an ill omen for government hopes of easing tensions.  “We’re obviously not at all satisfied by the government’s announcements,” Philippe Martinez, leader of the C.G.T., said after the prime minister’s speech. “They’re not taking us seriously, and they’re not taking seriously those who are in the fight today.”  The most hard-line unions like the C.G.T. want the government to withdraw the whole project. Others, like the C.F.D.T., are not opposed to an overhaul in principle, but are suspicious of the government’s plans and want guarantees that nobody will lose out. France’s pension system, one of the most protective in the world, has been a traditional third rail in national politics, responsible for the downfall or weakening of successive governments. The current administration may not prove an exception.  Mr. Philippe warned his parliamentary representatives on Tuesday that he would not be waving any “magic wand” to end the strikes. And the disruption for commuters continued on Wednesday, with most subway lines in Paris still shut, and most medium- and long-distance trains canceled. Already, the effects on shopping, tourism and trucking are being felt.  In his speech, the prime minister notably excluded older workers from the pension overhaul. He also offered guarantees to those in a host of professions — including teachers, nurses, soldiers and police officers — that their pension benefits would remain intact.  But it quickly became clear that he had not backed down far enough to quell the social unrest plaguing Mr. Macron’s government less than a year after he brought tenuous calm to the “Yellow Vest” uprising that began over a gasoline tax and expanded into wider discontent over his policies.   Some unions quickly called for a redoubling of resistance to the government. The head of a major rail union, Laurent Brun, said a “toughening of the strike” was now needed in response to Mr. Philippe. And Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the leftist France Unbowed party, said: “Those who are now 15 are condemned to this points system. The others are thrown into an incoherent and treacherous labyrinth.”  Mr. Philippe said that the full effect of the pension changes would be felt only by people born after 2004, and those born before 1975 would not be affected at all, he promised. For people born between those years, only the period they work after 2025 would be affected, he said. The prime minister also fixed the minimum pension at about $1,100 a month.  “We’re proposing a new pact between the generations, one faithful in spirit to that which the National Resistance Council put in place after the war,” he said, referring to the 1940s body that coordinated the actions of the French Resistance and outlined postwar social and economic policies that became the foundation of France’s social security model. “It’s a profound reform of the rules, to correct injustices and to take into account the new realities.” But Mr. Philippe was firm on crucial points that brought tens of thousands into the streets and halted public transport: The “special systems” governing pensions for millions will be scrapped, replacing 42 plans with one points-based system for all workers. The new law would ensure that the value of the points would not diminish over time, he said.  The overhaul has been a central goal of Mr. Macron and Mr. Philippe, who have argued that getting the French to retire later and streamlining the pension system are necessary steps to put the system on a sounder financial footing. Mr. Macron wants to unify the system and do away with the special pensions systems that date back decades, or even centuries in a few cases. He would give all workers points correlated to the number of years they work, and people would cash them in upon retirement. Mr. Philippe argued that the government’s new universal plan was far more adapted to the contemporary realities of work: careers that are interrupted, that take place over several jobs and that start or finish at varying ages.  The government, he said, wanted to “guarantee the French a stronger and more durable social protection, because it won’t depend on the demography of professions, so that one’s professional choice won’t weigh on retirees. Our children will have less linear careers than ours. We’ve got to give them confidence that our system no longer seems to privilege some over others.”  Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.']","Workers would be urged to work until 64, two years past the legal retirement age, the government said, revealing details of a planned pension overhaul that has prompted strikes.

Foreign Experts Quit Inquiry of Hong Kong Police Over Lack of Powers,2019-12-11,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — A group of foreign experts hired to give more credibility to Hong Kong’s police watchdog while it investigated accusations of brutality has quit over the agency’s lack of powers, dealing a blow to the government. The experts said in a statement they would “formally stand aside” after concluding that the city’s police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council, had limited authority to conduct independent investigations. The protest movement has called for a judge-led independent commission to review the police’s conduct, a demand that draws broad public support. Critics say the council, which is stacked with conservative figures and unable to summon witnesses, is toothless. The government and the police force have rejected the protesters’ demand, saying the watchdog would suffice. The watchdog hired the international panel, which included policing experts from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in early September to try to give the probe more credibility. The foreign experts said last month that the council needed the power to subpoena witnesses and verify the police’s version of events. The experts said on Wednesday that without such authority, the inquiry would not meet the public’s expectations “of a police watchdog operating in a society that values freedoms and rights.” The watchdog had earlier rejected the foreign experts’ recommendations, with the council’s chairman, Anthony Neoh, saying in an interview with the Chinese news media that the experts did not understand Hong Kong’s laws. Pro-democracy lawmakers said the panel’s decision to pull out of the investigation only served to support the public’s demands. “The whole incident has become an international laughingstock,” Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, told reporters on Wednesday. She said the government thought seeking foreign expertise “could rationalize their irrational state of affairs, but now the opposite has happened.” The council is expected to deliver a preliminary report on its findings in January. Tanya Chan, an opposition lawmaker, said the experts’ resignations amounted to a “vote of no confidence” on the investigation. She urged Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s beleaguered leader, to persuade Beijing to support an independent investigation when she meets with Chinese leaders this weekend. The police have fired nearly 16,000 rounds of tear gas and 10,000 rubber bullets since the protests began in June over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to China. The heavy use of tear gas, including in densely populated residential neighborhoods, has prompted public health and environmental concerns. More than 6,000 people between the ages of 11 and 84 have been arrested in the continuing unrest. The police have faced increasing condemnation after being accused of failing to quickly respond to a mob attack on antigovernment protesters in late July in the northern district of Yuen Long. In late August, riot police officers charged onto a subway train, fired pepper spray and beat people in the carriage, further tarnishing the force’s image. Hundreds of thousands of people poured onto the streets on Sunday, six months into the movement, in one of the largest marches in weeks to pressure the government to meet demands for greater civil liberties and police accountability. But Mrs. Lam has refused to make any further concessions, raising the prospect that the demonstrations could continue for the foreseeable future. Tensions in Hong Kong eased somewhat after the pro-democracy camp scored a stunning victory in local elections last month, but the police say they are increasingly concerned about the threat of violence. The force said officers had found two homemade bombs containing about 22 pounds of explosives near a high school a day after Sunday’s protest. Ezra Cheung contributed reporting.']",The panel’s withdrawal is a blow to the government’s effort to meet public demands for an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality.
Chile Plane Bound for Antarctica Goes Missing With 38 Aboard,2019-12-10,By Pascale Bonnefoy and Austin Ramzy,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — A fleet of military aircraft and navy and merchant ships continue searching the gelid waters north of Antarctica for a Chilean Air Force cargo plane that went missing on Monday evening with 38 people on board. The plane, a C-130 Hercules, vanished without a trace after making its last radio contact at 6:13 p.m. It was carrying 17 crew members and 21 passengers on a maintenance mission to the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva base, a key Chilean outpost on King George Island, off the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the air force said in a statement. President Sebastián Piñera canceled his trip on Tuesday to attend the inauguration of President Alberto Fernández of Argentina and said the government would spare no effort to find the plane. “We are doing everything humanly possible to find them, despite extraordinarily difficult conditions,” he said. The Uruguayan and Argentine air forces each contributed a C-130 plane to assist in the search, while the United States has provided two satellite orbits to capture images. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil has also offered to help, said Karla Rubilar, a spokeswoman for the government of Chile. The Chilean air force declared shortly after midnight that the plane had crashed because by then the aircraft would have run out of gas. General Arturo Merino, the air force commander in chief, said that the accident probably occurred 294 miles north of Antarctica, in the middle of the Drake Passage, where he said ocean depths could be over 2 miles. Rough weather, poor visibility and waves almost 20 feet high are making search efforts difficult, he said, “but we are not losing hope.” The Drake Passage connects the South Atlantic and South Pacific oceans between the southern tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. It has some of the world’s worst weather, and is known for its frigid temperatures and powerful storms. The plane was transporting crew members to inspect a floating pipeline that helps keep the base powered, the air force said. All but three of the passengers were members of the Chilean military; two were civilians from an engineering company and another was a 24-year-old university student at the top of his class who won an award to start an internship in Antarctica. The plane departed from Chile’s Chabunco Air Base in Punta Arenas, near the country’s southern tip, at 4:55 p.m. for a 770 mile journey and reported its last position an hour and a half later, according to an air force statement. The air force announced a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the accident. Chile has four permanent bases in Antarctica that support scientific research on issues including biodiversity and climate change. During President Piñera’s first term in 2011, a Chilean air force CASA 212 crashed into the sea as it tried to land on Robinson Crusoe Island, part of the Juan Fernández archipelago, a Chilean territory in the South Pacific.  The small aircraft practically disintegrated upon contact with the water, killing all 21 passengers, which included members of the air force, a television crew, the ministry of culture and of a charitable organization presided over by the brother of Chile’s current education minister, Marcela Cubillos, who died in the accident.

"Who Is Sanna Marin, Finland’s 34-Year-Old Prime Minister?",2019-12-10,By Megan Specia,"['When Sanna Marin, 34, was sworn into office on Tuesday, she became the world’s youngest prime minister, a fact that drew international attention this week when her party elected her as Finland’s next leader.  But while the world is just becoming acquainted with the new, left-leaning leader, Ms. Marin has been a rising star in Finland’s Social Democratic Party since first entering Parliament in 2015. For many, she was a natural choice for her new role.  “She doesn’t come out of nowhere,” said Johanna Kantola, a professor of gender studies at Finland’s Tampere University. “And she is quite well-liked.” Ms. Marin was voted in by her party after a turbulent week in which Prime Minister Antti Rinne resigned over criticism from within his coalition government of the handling of a postal workers’ strike. Mr. Rinne will continue as chief of the Social Democrats. She takes up the leadership at a volatile, polarized time in Finnish politics. In elections in April, the Social Democrats only narrowly edged out the right-wing, populist Finns Party, winning the premiership for the first time in 16 years, but polls indicate that the Finns Party has gained in popularity since then. In those elections, support for centrist parties fell, and no party won even 18 percent of the vote. When Mr. Rinne ran into troubles, none of his coalition partners wanted to risk bringing down the new coalition and rolling the dice on another election. As prime minister, Ms. Marin heads a government that is remarkably female and young. The other four parties in the government are led by women, three of whom are, like the prime minister, younger than 35. Speaking to reporters shortly after being sworn in, Ms. Marin waved off questions about the global interest in her new appointment, saying she was focused on governing. “My thoughts have been in the proceedings and I have not followed the international and national media coverage,” she said. “We have promised change. Now we need action. I believe that trust will return through action.” Ms. Marin gained popularity as head of the Tampere City Council from 2013 until 2017, when YouTube videos of her leading contentious and often heated meetings drew national attention.  “The style with which she managed the whole situation, she’s been quite admired for that,” Ms. Kantola said. “She is very centered on policies and issues, so she wants to talk about policies, not draw attention to herself.” Elected to Parliament in 2015, Ms. Marin was re-elected in May 2019 and has served as the Minister of Transport and Communications. Ms. Kantola called her a clear choice for prime minister. Ms. Marin is considered left-leaning, even within her party, and climate change, equality and social welfare are at the top of her agenda. On Tuesday, in a post on Twitter, she wrote about her commitment to build a better society in Finland.  “Finland will not be finished in four years, but it can get better,” Ms. Marin wrote in the post. “That’s what we’re working on. I want to build a society where every child can become anything and every person can live and grow in dignity.” But the world of government did not always seem accessible to Ms. Marin. Born in 1985 in Helsinki, she moved often as a child and has spoken about how coming from a low-income family made politics seem out of reach. When she first entered Parliament in 2015, she spoke to Me Naiset, a Finnish magazine, about the challenges. “When I was in high school, I felt that the people in politics were quite different and came from different backgrounds than me,” she told the magazine. Her parents separated when she was a child, and she was raised by her mother and her mother’s female partner, according to the article. She describes herself as being from a “rainbow family” and told the magazine she often felt invisible because she couldn’t talk openly about her family. “That was something that couldn’t be discussed,” she said. “It is only now in the 21st century that the debate about rainbow families has begun to be fairly open.” She now lives in Tampere with her husband and their young daughter, and said her family dynamic has shaped her political life. “For me, human rights and equality of people have never been questions of opinion but the basis of my moral conception,” she said in a statement on her website. “I joined politics because I want to influence how society sees its citizens and their rights.” Jenni Karimaki, a senior researcher at the Center for Parliamentary Studies at the University of Turku, said Ms. Marin’s rise could aid her party, which has struggled since taking the helm of government.  “This is the new start that the Social Democrats have been looking for, for a long time now,” Ms. Karimaki said. She predicted that Ms. Marin would most likely become the official head of the party after its convention this summer. Ms. Kantola, the gender studies professor, noted a sharp contrast between the new government and the older, male-dominated center-right government in power from 2015 to 2019.  “It kind of took us back to 1980 in a way, and it’s not just this political representation side, that they were old white men, but it was also the kinds of politics that they did,” she said. “It was a very bad time for gender equality.” Turnout this year was the highest in decades, almost 73 percent. Ms. Kantola said a backlash against the previous government drove a surge in voters electing younger, more liberal and often female lawmakers.  “It doesn’t take away the fact that obviously there are people in Finland that are not happy to have an all-female leadership of the government,” she said. “It’s a very strong contradiction.” Johanna Lemola contributed reporting from Helsinki.']","Ms. Marin took office on Tuesday, becoming the youngest head of government in the world. She leads a coalition headed entirely by women."
E.U. Climate Plan Would Sweeten Deal for Coal Countries,2019-12-11,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — The European Commission introduced on Wednesday its centerpiece climate strategy that, if approved, would pivot the world’s third-biggest polluter to climate-friendly economic policies and nudge coal-reliant nations with payouts worth billions of euros.  Known as the Green Deal, the plan would require many European Union member states to radically change how they operate their economies and find new livelihoods for millions of citizens, risking a continentwide backlash akin to the “Yellow Vest” protest movement that has riled France. The strategy paper, feverishly prepared over the past few weeks by the European Commission, the bloc’s administrative branch, has been described as a top priority for the next five years and beyond.  “Our goal is to reconcile our economy with our planet, and make it work for our people,” said the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. “The European Green Deal is as much about cutting emissions as it is about creating jobs.” It would legally commit all European Union nations to cut emissions from 1990s levels by at least 50 percent by 2030, up from the current goal of 40 percent.  It also takes as a given that 28 countries would commit to a net-neutral emissions target by 2050 that has so far proven elusive. (Britain is set to leave the bloc on Jan. 31.) In practice, countries that refuse to commit to the 2050 neutrality target will be swayed only when financial commitments are firmed up. European officials promise that will be soon. European nations are among history’s largest emitters of the planet-warming gases that have already raised global temperatures, and its moves to tamp down emissions are crucial to slowing global warming. But those moves could also encourage other major polluters — especially China, the world’s biggest producer of greenhouse gases — to rein in their own emissions. Officials gathered in Madrid this week for the annual United Nations climate negotiations were looking for two concrete signals from Brussels in the coming days: a stated commitment to ratchet down to net-zero emissions by 2050 as well as more ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 2030.  The European Union and China are scheduled to hold a climate summit in Germany next fall. But Alden Meyer of the Union for Concerned Scientists said in Madrid that China was unlikely to commit to stronger targets unless Europe did so first. The commission is expected to present draft laws in January for approval, although debate and input from the national governments of the member states are likely to water down its current proposal. Most of the policies are unlikely to take effect before 2021. Getting European countries to ditch polluting industries will not be cheap. At the heart of the commission’s proposals is a mechanism to pay out billions of euros to nations that rely on coal — especially the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. They have long blocked the European Union from committing to a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At a meeting of European leaders in Brussels on Thursday, the commission and officials from countries like France will try to convince skeptical nations like Poland that the compensation fund for phasing out polluting industries will be flush and willing to dispense cash to nations making the transition.  European Union officials said that the goal was to put down a relatively limited amount of cash — 5 billion to 8 billion euros, or about $6 billion to $9 billion — and use financial instruments to help pay for projects like building wind farms, upgrading railways and teaching employees of coal plants new skills so that they could find other work. The commission hopes the financial instruments will expand the assistance to €100 billion. They acknowledged that the cash component was small, but said they had to work within the constraints of the bloc’s budget was small. These sweeteners will be crucial for Poland and its allies, which view the European Union climate goals as out of pace with their domestic realities. They will try to squeeze out as much as they can for their domestic economies, setting up tough negotiations over the climate plan. The proposals are already being criticized from many quarters, underscoring how tough a sell they will be. Environmental groups like Greenpeace and many Green politicians in the European Parliament who reviewed the policies have called the proposals half-baked, rushed and unconvincing. And it is not only smaller European countries that need persuading. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, recently passed a law to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and meet Paris Agreement targets, but it still relies on heavily polluting industries.  For example, despite top-level political commitments, the influential Federation of German Industries warned on Tuesday that the European Union’s new emissions targets would “unsettle” businesses and consumers.

"Facing Criticism Over Muslim Camps, China Says: What’s the Problem?",2019-12-09,By Chris Buckley and Austin Ramzy,"['BEIJING — On Twitter and YouTube, with slick videos and strident editorials, the Chinese government has gone on the offensive to reject mounting evidence that it is detaining Muslims in droves, depicting its critics as players in a Western conspiracy.  China’s aggressive media campaign comes after exposés published by The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists about the government’s drive to detain a million or more members of largely Muslim minority groups in indoctrination camps. The reports, which used leaked official documents to reveal the coercive workings of the camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, sharpened international criticism of China’s ruling Communist Party.  The pushback from China has escalated in recent days after the United States House of Representatives last week overwhelmingly supported a bill that could impose sanctions on Chinese officials overseeing the internment drive.  Chinese officials have accused Western lawmakers, experts and news outlets of maligning the government’s policies and stirring ethnic discord in Xinjiang. At a news conference in Beijing on Monday, Shohrat Zakir, the chairman of the Xinjiang government, dismissed the congressional bill as “crude meddling in China’s internal affairs.” He sought to foil the criticism by saying that the facilities — which Beijing calls vocational training centers — were now holding only people who were there voluntarily. Others who were previously in the facilities had “graduated,” he said, providing no specifics and declining to say whether they had been released.  He would not say how many people were currently or previously held. Uighurs and Kazakhs abroad have said they have seen no evidence of large-scale releases. Beijing’s case appears unlikely to win over experts who include officials from the United Nations. An abundance of evidence shows that the authorities have pursued a sweeping campaign to detain Uighurs and Kazakhs in camps designed to turn them into loyal supporters of the Communist Party.  Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch who has closely studied Xinjiang, said the party’s claims lacked credibility. “This comes from a government that pretty much lies about most reports coming from the region,” she said. “If the Chinese government has indeed released people from the camps,” she added, “then it should allow independent observers, including from the United Nations, to enter the region without any kind of restrictions to see for themselves.”  Beijing has said that its policies in Xinjiang are aimed at curbing extremism and have pulled the region back from bloody anarchy. The latest media campaign reflects the government’s confidence that its narrative could undermine independent Western analysis and news reports on the region, and perhaps blunt the push in some countries to censure China over the hard-line policies. On Twitter and in Chinese newspapers, Chinese commentators have accused prominent Western scholars of serving as tools of American intelligence agencies regarding Xinjiang. Twitter is banned within China, but that does not stop the government and its supporters from using the platform to make their case that the camps have stamped out attacks in Xinjiang. The Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Chinese Communist Party, published an interview with a regional government spokesman who said that two prominent foreign experts on Xinjiang, Adrian Zenz and Darren Byler, were cooperating with “anti-China forces in the U.S. to smear China’s Xinjiang policies.”  Mr. Byler, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, and Mr. Zenz, a senior fellow in China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, said the attack on them seemed to reflect growing anxiety among Chinese officials that they were losing the international argument over the camps. “Painting me and Darren Byler as intelligence agents is a very poorly done, crude, smearing counterattack,” Mr. Zenz said. “I think it’s very unconvincing. People are not believing them anymore.” Not all of China’s media offensive has dwelled on the claims of success in Xinjiang. China’s state-run international broadcaster, CGTN, posted several English-language videos on YouTube featuring footage of what it said were earlier attacks by Uighurs swept up in extremism and separatist movements.  The government showed one of the videos to journalists on Monday that included gruesome scenes from a 2014 attack by Uighur militants at a railway station in Kunming, in southwestern China, that killed 31 people and injured 141 others. “The horrific images and alarming number of violent crimes reveal the seriousness of the security situation in China’s western frontier,” the English-language voice-over says. “Chinese police have identified Xinjiang as a key battlefield.” Mr. Byler said the videos could help deflect criticism of the detentions by playing on exaggerated fears that Uighurs are susceptible to becoming terrorists. But the videos avoid fundamental questions about whether the scale of the government’s response is appropriate, he said. “They are missing that point where they go from ‘This handful of people did bad things’ to ‘We need to lock up 1.8 million or however many people are estimated in camps,’” Mr. Byler said. Former camp detainees who have left China have described numbing, harsh and even brutal treatment inside the facilities. Detainees are subject to constant indoctrination that warns them to renounce religious fervor and support the Communist Party. They are forced to study Chinese, memorize laws, practice marching and learn skills for factory work. Legal experts have said that even under China’s sweeping powers of detention, there is no sound backing for the camps, which subject inmates to months or years of detention without trial or effective means of appeal. Last month, six experts and officials on United Nations human rights panels also criticized the regulations that China has cited to justify the mass detentions, saying that the rules were “incompatible with China’s obligations under international human rights law.” China has also continued to put tremendous pressure on former detainees and other Uighurs who have spoken out about the campaign from abroad. Asiye Abdulaheb, a Uighur woman in the Netherlands who said she was involved in the release of the 24 pages of documents published by news outlets last month, has described being harassed and threatened.  “The Chinese police would definitely find us,” she said in an interview on Saturday. She described Chinese security officers as telling her ex-husband: “We know about all your matters. We have a lot of people in the Netherlands.” Zoe Mou contributed research.']","Chinese officials have released social media videos, blistering editorials and attacks on researchers in a push to counter evidence of its Muslim internment drive."
"New Zealand Volcano Still Too Dangerous for Rescue Crews, Officials Say",2019-12-11,By Jamie Tarabay,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — Rescue workers on Wednesday were again forced to delay attempts to reach White Island to recover the bodies of people believed to have been killed in a volcanic eruption there. The authorities said conditions were still too dangerous and unpredictable to risk the attempt. A volcanologist, Graham Leonard, said at a news conference that the chance of another eruption on the scale of Monday’s explosion happening within the next 24 hours was between 40 and 60 percent. He added that for anyone traveling to the volcanic island now, even walking and breathing would be a challenge. Dozens of people were rescued after the eruption Monday, but the authorities later said that eight people were still believed to be on the island and presumed dead. On Wednesday, the New Zealand police released a list of nine people who they said were officially considered missing, seven from Australia and two from New Zealand. The police would not explain the discrepancy. Deputy Commissioner John Tims of the New Zealand police expressed frustration that recovery efforts had been delayed for a second day, but said the risks — including the hazards that toxic fumes could pose to rescue crews — outweighed the sense of urgency.  “My intent is absolutely to return to that island,” he said. “Those families and friends absolutely deserve closure, and I’m going to work really hard to make that happen.” White Island — also known by its Maori name, Whakaari — erupted on Monday afternoon as 47 people were touring the volcano’s crater. As of Wednesday, eight people were confirmed to have been killed.  About 30 victims of the eruption, which covered the island in gray ash, have been sent to seven hospitals around New Zealand, because the nearest hospital’s burns unit was overwhelmed. Most of the injured had burns over at least 30 percent of their bodies. About two dozen of the victims were Australian, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said the country was sending three air force planes to bring some of them home. Other victims were from New Zealand, China, Germany, Malaysia, Britain and the United States.  Mr. Leonard, the volcanologist, said tremors on the island were escalating, increasing the chances of another eruption within the next day or so. “There are two key risks,” he said. “The first is environmental — at times it will be challenging for breathing, walking and seeing on the island — and there are risks for another eruption.” As of Wednesday afternoon, the GeoNet agency, which monitors geological activity in New Zealand, put White Island at threat level three out of five. After the eruption on Monday, it was raised to four.  White Island has long been a popular tourist destination, billed as offering a chance to get close to an active volcano. Before this week, the deadliest incident there had been in 1914, when 10 miners were killed after part of a crater wall collapsed. The island, which is privately owned, became a scenic reserve in 1953, and more than 10,000 people visit each year. Since Monday, victims’ family members and others have asked why tours had been allowed to continue despite warnings that volcanic activity had been on the rise. ']","Efforts to recover victims were delayed again Wednesday, as an expert said there was a strong chance of another major eruption within 24 hours."
"As Rivals Fight for Control of Libya, Erdogan Says Turkey May Jump In",2019-12-11,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['LONDON — The battle for control of Libya threatened to escalate further this week as Turkey said it might intervene to stop the Russian-backed forces now closing in on Tripoli, the capital. In comments to Turkish television networks on Monday night and again on Tuesday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pointedly raised the possibility that Turkey might send troops to counter the Russians if the United Nations-recognized government headquartered in Tripoli formally requested it. “In case of such an invitation, Turkey will decide itself about what kind of initiative to undertake,” Mr. Erdogan said Monday. On both Monday and Tuesday he referred explicitly to the possibility of “sending soldiers” or “our personnel.” Mr. Erdogan, for commercial and political reasons, has emerged as the last significant patron of the beleaguered Tripoli government. His blunt talk of a new military intervention underscored the perilousness of the situation now facing the Tripoli government, which is under a tightening siege by Russian forces backing the militia leader Khalifa Hifter.  Officials of Tripoli’s so-called Government of National Accord said they were open to any assistance that advanced its mission. “The G.N.A. welcomes ALL international support,” Mohamed Ali Abdullah, an adviser for United States affairs to the Tripoli government, wrote in a text message. Libya is a strategic prize with vast oil reserves and a long Mediterranean coastline. But eight years after a NATO intervention helped topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi during the Arab Spring revolt, the country remains mired in chaos. The bedlam has turned its beaches into a departure point for tens of thousands of Europe-bound migrants and its deserts into a haven for bands of militant extremists. Over the last three months, Russia has transformed Libya’s simmering civil conflict by deploying large numbers of fighters in what increasingly appears to be a determined push to help Mr. Hifter capture the capital. Mr. Hifter, 76, had been waging an  on-again, off-again fight to take Tripoli for more than five years, with no success. His most recent assault, launched April 4, left his forces stalled for more than five months on the southern outskirts of the city. Now, however, the heavy Russian support has enabled Mr. Hifter’s forces to renew their advance into the city. Over the weekend, they captured most of the neighborhood of Salah el-Deen, one of their biggest gains in months. “The momentum has definitely shifted,” said Frederic Wehrey, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who recently returned from a visit to the front. He saw signs of exhaustion among some of the city’s defenders, he said.  “If morale snaps, it is a terrifying thing,"" Mr. Wehrey said. “And who knows when it is going to give way?” A collapse of the government would most likely mean a prolonged period of bloody street fighting inside the city, with years of insurgency by regional militias opposed to Mr. Hifter and now facing revenge. The turmoil would almost certainly set off new waves of internal and external migrants fleeing, analysts and diplomats say. For Washington, Mr. Wehrey argued, allowing Russian forces to establish dominance in Libya, as they already have in Syria, would also “seriously damage whatever U.S. credibility is remaining in the Middle East.” “Russia is basically pushing on a door that has been creaking open for a while,” he said. The United States has largely withdrawn from Libya while the European powers have been divided over how to approach it. Since the United States began to pull back after the 2011 NATO intervention, an array of regional powers — all Western-armed American partners — have plunged into the vacuum, providing weapons and support to favored clients doing battle with one another. The United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and France eventually lined up behind Mr. Hifter, betting that his authoritarian style could restore stability. Turkey, in part because of its rivalry with the Emirati-Egyptian-Saudi bloc in a regional cold war, has become the only significant military backer of the Tripoli government. The United States, along with the other Western powers, also publicly supports the Tripoli government and a United Nations-sponsored peace process on the unity government, but only Turkey has provided military support. Washington, in practice, has sent mixed signals. United States officials, who say the Russian forces in Libya now include uniformed troops as well as mercenaries, have called their presence “incredibly destabilizing” and warned of “the specter of large-scale casualties among the civilian population.” But the National Security Council official overseeing Libya, Victoria Coates, met with Mr. Hifter two weeks ago to discuss peace talks, granting him a new level of recognition from the White House.  When Mr. Hifter began his advance, in April, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement condemning the assault on Tripoli, but the White House released a statement days later saying President Trump had called Mr. Hifter to commend his fight against “terrorism.” This week, United States military officials said that they believed a Russian air defense system installed in Libya had brought down an American surveillance drone. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, chief of the United States Africa Command, said in a statement on Monday that the forces that brought down the drone had not realized it was American. “But they certainly know who it belongs to now,” he said, “and they are refusing to return it. They say they don’t know where it is, but I am not buying it.” Before the Russian intervention this fall, the Libyan strife had consisted mainly of simmering, low-intensity warfare. A total of a few hundred untrained fighters at any one time clashed in a handful of deserted districts on the edge of Tripoli, as armed drones fired down from above. Mr. Hifter’s forces flew Chinese-made drones furnished by the United Arab Emirates, and the Tripoli forces countered with less potent Turkish models. But all that began to change as the Russian forces arrived earlier this fall. By October, as many as two hundred Russian mercenaries had arrived, and within weeks the number grew to more than a thousand. They brought with them more advanced air power, better coordinated air support for ground troops, and guided artillery, as well as trained snipers. With their help, Mr. Hifter’s forces now control the air. The Tripoli government’s Turkish drones seem to have disappeared from the sky, presumably damaged or destroyed by Mr. Hifter’s allies. “The Tripoli forces have nothing in the air now,” said Wolfram Lacher, a scholar of Libya at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “Everyone is waiting for the new Turkish equipment to arrive.” Mr. Erdogan spoke for years about avoiding conflicts in the region. But his talk of intervening in Libya follows a Turkish incursion into northern Syria two months ago, as Turkish troops moved against American-backed, Kurdish-led militias there and struck an accommodation with the Russian forces active in the country. In the television interview on Monday night, Mr. Erdogan pledged to appeal personally to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at a meeting in January. Calling Mr. Hifter “an outlaw,” Mr. Erdogan said, “On the Hifter issue, I don’t want it to give birth to a new Syria in relations.”  He added, “I believe Russia will also review its existing stance toward Hifter.” Mr. Erdogan has more at stake, though, than stability in Libya. His comments about a possible military intervention come just days after Ankara signed a deal with the Tripoli government that would give Turkey drilling, pipeline and other maritime rights over an expanded portion of the Mediterranean Sea between the countries. That set off outrage from Greece and Europe, but gave Turkey a new financial stake in the Tripoli government. The president’s statements, Mr. Lacher said, “suggest that this agreement is so important to the Turks that they are willing to do whatever it takes to stop Hifter from winning.”']",President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey might send troops to Libya to counter Russian-backed militia forces.
"Iran Banks Burned, Then Customer Accounts Were Exposed Online",2019-12-10,By Farnaz Fassihi and Ronen Bergman,"['After demonstrators in Iran set fire to hundreds of bank branches last month in antigovernment protests, the authorities dealt with another less visible banking threat that is only now coming to fuller light: a security breach that exposed the information of millions of Iranian customer accounts. As of Tuesday, details of 15 million bank debit cards in Iran had been published on social media in the aftermath of the protests, unnerving customers and forcing the government to acknowledge a problem. The exposure represented the most serious banking security breach in Iran, according to Iranian media and a law firm representing some of the victims. The breach, which targeted customers of Iran’s three largest banks, was likely to further rattle an economy already reeling from the effects of American sanctions and came as Iran’s leadership was grappling with deep-seated anger over its deadly crackdown on the protests.  The number of affected accounts represents close to a fifth of the country’s population. “This is the largest financial scam in Iran’s history,” reported Aftab News, a conservative media outlet. “Millions of Iranians are worried to find their names among the list of hacked accounts.” Iran’s information and telecommunications minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, described the breach as data theft by a disgruntled contractor who had access to the accounts and had exposed them as part of an extortion attempt. He denied the banking system’s computers had been hacked.  But outside cyberexperts disputed that claim. They also said a breach of such magnitude was likely the work of a state entity aiming to stoke instability, not criminals whose objective is blackmail for financial gain. Iran has been engaged in a cycle of hack and counterhack in a cyberwar against the United States and Israel. Both sides have targeted each other’s financial and sensitive government institutions through cyberattacks for years. The banks affected — Mellat, Tejarat and Sarmayeh — had all been sanctioned more than a year ago by the United States Treasury, which accused them of having transferred money on behalf of blacklisted entities of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, part of the armed forces. The entire Revolutionary Guards organization was designated as a terrorist group by the Trump administration last April. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the Iran banking breach.  A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said: “We do not respond to foreign reports.” Analysts monitoring Iran said that regardless of who was responsible, the breach created another financial challenge for the Islamic Republic as it struggles to manage tough economic sanctions imposed by the United States, as well as unrest at home and a political backlash in the region over Iran’s influence.  The data exposure could have a long-term impact on the three banks if customers lose trust and withdraw their money.  Iran’s official silence for nearly two weeks on the exposure could reflect a reluctance by the leadership to acknowledge that its financial institutions are vulnerable, experts said. The bank card data first began to appear on Nov. 27, but it was not until Sunday that Mr. Azari Jahromi, the information minister, commented on the breach. The persons or entity behind the attack and the motivation remain unclear. The account information was published on a channel called “Your banking cards” on Telegram, a popular mobile phone app used in Iran. The first message warned that “we will burn the reputation of their banks the same way we torched their banks,” referring to protesters across Iran who pillaged and burned about 730 bank branches. The message on Telegram also stated that the perpetrators had demanded payment from the banks but their request had been ignored, and therefore they would be releasing the details on millions of bank cards. Within hours, they did. The information uploaded on Telegram contains names of account holders and account numbers but the PIN codes appear obscured. The information also included directions on how to make homemade forgeries of cards containing the leaked information. The banks sent clients text messages and Iran’s cyberpolice alerted them in an email titled, “Your bank account is in danger of illegal usage,” and asked customers to visit a bank branch and replace their cards, according to a copy of the email published in Iranian media.  None of the three banks have issued public statements acknowledging the breach. ClearSky, a cybersecurity company that was among the first to issue warnings of the breach, said it had damaged the flow of financial transactions inside Iran and had harmed the reputation of the affected banks, with customers panicking about their personal information having been made public. Boaz Dolev, the chief executive officer of ClearSky, said the scope of the breach indicated that whoever was responsible possessed “high technological capability, which is usually at the hand of state intelligence services.” ClearSky issued a warning to Israeli credit card companies on Dec. 3 to be on alert in case of an Iranian counterattack if the authorities in Tehran concluded the banks had been compromised by hostile foreign powers. The last major hacking targeting Iranian banks occurred in 2012 when hackers gained access to the account information of three million users across 22 banks. An information technology specialist, Khosrow Zare Farid, who formerly managed a company for electronic payments in Iran, claimed responsibility for the hack to prove security loopholes in Iran’s electronic banking system, according to media reports. In the United States, the Justice Department accused Iran of major cyberattacks from 2011 to 2013 targeting several American banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, US Bank and PNC Bank. The hackers interrupted customer service and jammed websites. In 2016, seven Iranians were indicted on federal charges for cyberattacks on behalf of the Revolutionary Guards. The Trump administration has given the United States military more power to launch pre-emptive cyberattacks on Iranian interests, reversing a directive under President Barack Obama that required the president’s permission for cyberattacks that could trigger “significant consequences.” An Iranian organization that identifies itself as the Citizenship Protection Foundation has offered free legal consultations for Iranians affected by the data breach, according to its website and reports in Iranian media. The organization’s home page includes a link to “the hacking of 10 million accounts” and says that Iran’s intelligence officials are investigating. Amir Rashidi, an Iranian internet expert who designed the cyberstructure of Iran’s state-owned petrochemical industry, said that although Iran’s state-sponsored hackers are sophisticated, the cybersecurity of most government entities and banks in the country “is in shambles.” Many loopholes, he said, “make it easy and possible for state actors and criminals to hack the system.” Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting.']",The details of millions of Iranian bank cards were published online after antigovernment protests last month.

A Bitter Election Dispute Sends Afghanistan Back to the Brink,2019-12-12,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — Three months after Afghanistan’s presidential vote, the entire electoral process is stalled in a dispute that Afghan and Western officials say could pose an even greater threat to stability than the last such crisis, five years ago. Supporters of opposition candidates have besieged half a dozen election offices around the country for weeks, vowing to fight rather than accept another United States-brokered compromise like the one that resolved the 2014 dispute. Security officials worry that one wrong move could tip the protests into bloodshed. And election officials say a biometric verification process that was supposed to prevent voter fraud may have been compromised by human error.  In the middle of it all — again — is Abdullah Abdullah, making his third attempt to become president, and for the third time falling into a bitter standoff with election officials. This one is likely to play out differently. With American diplomacy focused on negotiating an end to the long war with the Taliban, Western officials say the United States has made it clear that it will not be stepping in as it did five years ago. Then, Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated a power-sharing deal between Mr. Abdullah, now Afghanistan’s chief executive, and Ashraf Ghani, now the president, that Mr. Kerry said averted a civil war. Since Mr. Abdullah and his supporters forced the American intervention in 2014, he has tried to project an image of unity, playing his part in a “power sharing” government in which Mr. Ghani, in reality, has kept a lock on the power.  But Mr. Abdullah’s supporters are warier of him this time, though they say they are firm in rejecting what they see as fraud perpetrated to keep Mr. Ghani in office.  Even as Mr. Abdullah insists he will not give in, the strongmen who have rallied around him are worried, according to interviews with advisers and political brokers. In private, they have repeatedly raised their concern about Mr. Abdullah, often to his face: Will the man who has challenged two previous votes before compromising stick to the fight this time, or will he again strike a deal for his own political survival? “One’s own survival as a politician, if that is the aim of somebody — he is misleading and he is misled,” Mr. Abdullah said during an interview with The New York Times, acknowledging his allies’ concerns and saying he was determined to fight.  “Ghani is a challenge for the country, not for me,” he said. “The point is how to replace him through circumstances in which the country is not lost.” The truth is that the hodgepodge coalition of political leaders around the chief executive has little choice: They came at the last minute to Mr. Abdullah, who says he had been thinking of sitting out this race, because they couldn’t agree on another candidate.  For many of these former warlords and commanders, this is an ultimate fight of sorts. Mr. Ghani marginalized them, some to the point of repeated humiliation, and has promised to do so even more if he wins a second term.  Among those fighting for relevance is Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the erratic Uzbek commander whom Mr. Ghani made his vice president in 2014 to gain the support of his constituency, then stripped of much of his authority. General Dostum has been camped out in his northern stronghold in support of Mr. Abdullah, warning of a blood bath if soldiers use force against protesters.  At closed-door meetings of Mr. Abdullah’s political circle, another bullish northern commander repeatedly offered to take over a couple of provinces, kicking out the governors and police chiefs to send a message.  Mr. Abdullah frequently meets with Western ambassadors and generals to try to leverage the street demonstrations, officials say. Where the United States and NATO stand on the election is still seen as crucial, given Afghanistan’s dependence on their aid and support. After Mr. Ghani appeared with President Trump during his Thanksgiving Day visit to American troops in Afghanistan, Mr. Abdullah’s advisers were angry and confused, demanding to know why their candidate was being undermined by the Americans in the middle of an election dispute. Officials said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later called Mr. Abdullah in what appeared to be an attempt to placate him. At the heart of the dispute is 300,000 questionable votes that Mr. Abdullah’s supporters say the election authorities have counted without transparency, which could favor Mr. Ghani. The ballot verification system has indicated that about 100,000 of those votes were cast outside voting hours — in some cases, by months.  The election commission attributes that to human error in setting the time on devices that collect voters’ biometric data and register the time of their votes. Mr. Abdullah’s team accuses election officials of trying to belatedly alter the rules in Mr. Ghani’s favor. “Any game has predetermined rules, and you can’t change those rules after the game,” said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, Mr. Abdullah’s running mate. “Even in football, when the ball is out of bounds, it’s out; you can’t make up excuses and explanations to count it in after it’s out.” Mr. Ghani’s team has portrayed Mr. Abdullah as a master of obstruction, accusing him of purposely muddying the waters until he can get a share of power.  Friends and diplomats say Mr. Abdullah’s political endurance has as much to do with circumstance and luck as with his ability to play the long game. His skill lies in forging consensus in the toughest circumstances, and it has kept him relevant in Afghan politics. An ophthalmologist by training, Mr. Abdullah was a low-level liaison officer in the anti-Soviet guerrilla campaign, one of a group of fighters that years later would be central in supporting the United States invasion in 2001. After the Taliban were ousted, he became foreign minister and then leader of the opposition. He has risen above many other senior figures from Afghanistan’s north by balancing a narrative of guerrilla resistance with a modern outlook, dressing in expensive business suits and carrying himself with ease at receptions in Western capitals. The first time Mr. Abdullah ran for president — in 2009, against the incumbent Hamid Karzai — he claimed foul when Mr. Karzai was declared the winner. When international pressure forced that vote to a runoff, Mr. Abdullah pulled out of the race, to his supporters’ dismay. In 2014, Mr. Abdullah believed he had won the election in the first round, but he agreed to a runoff with Mr. Ghani, thinking his opponent had no chance. When the election commission said Mr. Ghani had won, Mr. Abdullah immediately alleged widespread fraud.  His supporters, much like today, wanted to declare a parallel government, block highways and take over provinces. Mr. Abdullah instead urged them to stay calm, and he agreed to the power-sharing deal that the United States brokered after months of stalemate. How Mr. Ghani treated Mr. Abdullah and his supporters during the ensuing five years is what is shaping the current dispute into a more dangerous fight.  The Afghan president showed little regard for the 50-50 deal once he took office, sidelining Mr. Abdullah and his allies — so much so that the allies turned on Mr. Abdullah, sometimes in messy public outbursts in which they ridiculed their own leader as soft. On one occasion, Mr. Ghani even sent his elite bodyguards to kick out a minister appointed by Mr. Abdullah and lock up his office. In the interview, Mr. Abdullah said his allies were urging the kind of head-on clash with Mr. Ghani that could have brought down the state. Whether out of political convenience or a deep fear of chaos, Mr. Abdullah has repeatedly told his advisers that pushing too far could tilt the country into anarchy that people like him would not be able to control.  He now seems faced once again with similar choices. At his pristine mansion, a stone’s throw from Mr. Ghani’s palace, Mr. Abdullah repeatedly pointed his finger in the president’s direction as he gave reasons why this time he would fight to the end. “If he wins fairly, I have the courage to congratulate him. Don’t worry about my friends; I will go to each and every one of them. I am not here to create problems for the country,” Mr. Abdullah said. “But what I am talking about is not winning based on votes — that’s not acceptable.”']","Abdullah Abdullah, a three-time contender for the presidency, is again at the center of an electoral crisis. This time, he insists he won’t compromise. "
"When Governments Get Complacent, Anger Rises",2019-12-13,By Damien Cave,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email.  What do the fires and smoke around Sydney, the volcano eruption in New Zealand that left at least eight people dead, and Bougainville’s vote for independence from Papua New Guinea all have in common?  During a long run yesterday, thinking about the Australia bureau’s stories over the past week, I began to see a theme running through them all: complacency.  The Cambridge English Dictionary defines it as “a feeling of calm satisfaction with your own abilities or situation that prevents you from trying harder.” Other dictionaries deliver even more scathing judgments, calling the complacent smug and unwilling to change even when confronting uncertain or dangerous situations. But no matter how harsh the definition, there is no denying that complacency — “the great chewing complacency,” as Aesop put it — damages lives in ways that bring sadness and rage. Let’s consider just the most recent examples, each of which offers its own insights on how a pattern of self-satisfied inaction might be broken. Prime Minister Scott Morrison came to Sydney Tuesday, on a day when bush fire smoke was at its thickest, and spent less time talking about the fires than about a religious freedom bill.  He was immediately pilloried by Sydneysiders who have become frustrated with his government’s refusal to actively address climate change through sharper emissions cuts, and more firefighting help here in a country where volunteers do most of that work.  At one point, when asked about firefighters raising money online for equipment, Mr. Morrison declared that firefighters didn’t need more assistance because they “want to be there.” That’s what did it. Outrage surged. The complacency broke, at least a little. The next day, he announced a boost of 11 million Australian dollars for more planes and helicopters to help firefighters on the ground. The Lesson: Climate change complacency tied to vested interests (coal, coal, coal) can be much harder to dislodge than the complacency around adaptation, which allows for more immediate visibility. Also: people risking their lives (in this case, for free) are powerful weapons in any fight against the status quo.  The tour operators who brought dozens of tourists to an active and remote volcano in New Zealand had gotten used to seeing the boiling crater lake and gas vents throwing hot fumes into the air.  They trusted local volcanologists, who said tour groups should be fine, and failed to plan for the evacuation that was needed Monday when White Island erupted, trapping 47 people. Eight have been confirmed dead and the bodies of another eight were in the process of being recovered as of Friday morning, for a total of 16 killed.  Ray Cas, an emeritus volcanologist at Monash University who visited White Island twice and immediately felt that tour groups should not be allowed, said he told colleagues in New Zealand about his concerns, but with 30 years of tour groups having passed through without incident, no one seemed eager to adjust or change.  “It’s the isolation and the lack of available of emergency services that is really a concern,” he said.  Now, New Zealand officials are just starting to discuss whether the tour groups should be banned, or whether more precautions need to be taken if anyone is to return to the island.  The Lesson: Tragedy, immediate and visceral, often does more to identify complacency and shift the dynamic than anything else.  When the Bougainville Peace Agreement of 2001 brought an end to the civil war that killed 20,000 people, many people in the region hoped Papua New Guinea would develop an equitable revenue-sharing deal for the mineral-rich islands before an independence vote arrived.  But in nearly two decades, little changed. And on Wednesday, nearly 98 percent of those who voted in Bougainville supported becoming an independent nation. The Lesson: If you ignore people’s needs and desires they eventually break away. For New Zealand’s tourism industry, and Australia’s conservative coalition, it’s worth keeping in mind.

"Israel Heads to Record Third Election, Extending Deadlock",2019-12-11,By David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Having failed to form a government after two elections, Israel barreled toward a record third on Wednesday, extending the political deadlock that has paralyzed the country for nearly a year and assuring at least three more months of bitter, divisive campaigning and government dysfunction. And with the country hopelessly divided over the fate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been indicted on three counts of corruption, there is little indication that the third election will be any more decisive than the first two. Israel’s inability to break the logjam has raised questions about the political system its citizens often boast is the only democracy in the Middle East. A democracy often compared to that of Britain or the United States is now evoking comparisons to the less stable governments of Greece and Italy. “What used to be a celebration of democracy has become a moment of shame for this building,” Yair Lapid, a former finance minister and political rival of the prime minister, said on the floor of Parliament Wednesday night. The Parliament had until midnight Wednesday to form a majority government. But the hour passed with the two leading candidates for prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu and the former army chief Benny Gantz, unable to negotiate a power-sharing agreement.  Until a new government is created, Mr. Netanyahu remains prime minister of a caretaker government. By clinging to office, analysts say, Mr. Netanyahu would at least leave himself in better position to negotiate a plea bargain with state prosecutors, and could perhaps avoid trial altogether in exchange for retiring from public life. In the next election, expected to be in March, he will have to campaign as a defendant in three criminal cases: He was indicted on Nov. 21 on bribery and other corruption charges, accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls for lavish gifts and extravagantly positive press.  It is unclear whether the indictment itself will hurt his chances, though, since the outlines of the cases against him have been known for months. Israeli opinion polls show that another contest between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz would result in the same stalemate: Mr. Gantz’s Blue and White party nearly always comes out slightly ahead, but falls short of enough partners to form a majority coalition. A poll on Tuesday by Israel’s Channel 13, however, showed Blue and White opening up a four-seat lead over Likud, and the anti-Netanyahu parties combined reaching 60 seats, compared with 52 seats for the prime minister’s party and its allies. A 61-seat majority is needed to form a government. The circumstances have shifted in other unhappy ways for Mr. Netanyahu: He is now contending with a noisy rebellion in the ranks of his own conservative Likud party from a growing contingent of local officials and activists who fear that his refusal to step aside could hand power to Israel’s center-left coalition. Likud on Wednesday tentatively called a primary contest for the party’s leadership on Dec. 26.  So far, Mr. Netanyahu has managed to keep the rebels largely at bay by encouraging his political base to rage against the criminal justice system, fulminating against the news media and political rivals to his left, and dangling promises to the right that if he keeps job, he can capitalize on his close ties to the Trump administration to deliver historic achievements, including annexing territory in the occupied West Bank. Mr. Gantz’s chances in a third round of elections also may have improved after his No. 2, Mr. Lapid, agreed Monday to give up his longstanding insistence on eventually succeeding Mr. Gantz as party leader, and potentially as prime minister. Polls have shown that Mr. Lapid’s rotation agreement with Mr. Gantz was costing Blue and White two to four seats in Parliament. Most Israelis are fed up with the contest and resent the idea of having a third election. It will cost this small country some $500 million at a time when it is running a deficit, will prevent critical problems like overcrowded hospitals and failing schools from being addressed, and will make the military wait for approval of a new five-year spending plan despite growing threats in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Still, Yohanan Plesner, president of the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute, said Israel’s governing institutions remained robust, particularly the law-enforcement authorities that had just indicted a sitting prime minister for the first time. Despite inherent flaws in the electoral system and some legal ambiguities in how to deal with a prime minister under indictment, he said, “I don’t think there is cause for long term alarm.” Mr. Plesner also noted that Israel was in good company. Since the mid-1990s it has held elections an average of every 2.3 years, but it now looks more like Greece, which held three elections within 10 months. “This instability is not something to be proud of,” he said, “but it is our lot and at the same time Israeli democracy is solid.”  Israelis may be heading back to the polls in a fog of unprecedented and unresolved legal problems. While the law allows an indicted prime minister to remain in office, it says nothing about whether a candidate charged with serious offenses should be allowed to form a new government. Israel’s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, has so far avoided issuing an opinion on that question, saying it was still only theoretical. But on Monday, the Supreme Court asked him to say by next week if or when he would clarify his views. The brewing revolt within Likud adds to the challenges facing Mr. Netanyahu. Gideon Saar, a popular former government minister, has drawn a growing number of local officials into open opposition to Mr. Netanyahu. The only contender so far who has pledged to challenge Mr. Netanyahu in the party’s primary contest, Mr. Saar has argued that a third election with Mr. Netanyahu in charge could cost the right its hold on power. Mr. Saar’s campaign has unfurled a growing list of endorsements by Likud mayors, party leaders and officials in West Bank settlements.  “There’s been no proper government in Israel for more than a year and there’s no end in sight,” said Shimon Lankri, the Likud mayor of Acre, explaining why he switched to support Mr. Saar. As the calls for Mr. Netanyahu to step aside have grown louder, he has fashioned an elaborate argument for why he should be allowed to continue as prime minister, at least for the first six months of a rotation agreement with Mr. Gantz.  Given the Trump administration’s favorable disposition toward Mr. Netanyahu, he has argued, Israel’s right wing has a window of opportunity — which could close as the 2020 presidential election heats up, let alone if Mr. Trump is defeated — to press Mr. Trump for important new favors. Chief among them is approval for Israel’s annexation of the Jordan Valley, a loosely populated agricultural region where Mr. Netanyahu insists Israel must maintain a military presence under any settlement with the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu announced that he had spoken of the idea with Mr. Trump in a phone call on Dec. 1, and then with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a meeting in Lisbon on Dec. 4. But David Schenker, the assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, told reporters on Friday that Mr. Netanyahu had presented Mr. Pompeo no formal plan for annexing the area, and reaffirmed the administration’s view that “the ultimate disposition of territory is to be determined between the parties,” not through unilateral moves. Mr. Netanyahu is also talking up a defense treaty with the United States, although Israeli military leaders have long played down the wisdom of such an agreement, saying that Israel can already count on American support whenever it is needed and that a formal pact could tie Israel’s hands in a regional conflict. Polls show that most Israelis hold Mr. Netanyahu responsible for the return to the ballot box. But on the right, some of Mr. Netanyahu’s defenders have pinned the continued political impasse on Mr. Gantz for refusing to enter a unity government led by Mr. Netanyahu, if only for a few months, or on Avigdor Liberman, the leader of the ultranationalist, secular Yisrael Beiteinu party and a former Netanyahu ally who broke ranks with the right-wing, religious alliance. About the only thing the parties seemed ready to agree on was a new election date — though not without some Talmudic debate and another round of 11th-hour brinkmanship. The political calendar dictated Tuesday, March 10, but that is Purim, a Jewish feast when revelers often drink themselves into oblivion, not conducive to performing a sober civic duty. The prior Tuesday is a memorial day for fallen soldiers. The third Tuesday in March coincides with the anniversary of the death of an obscure Hasidic rabbi. Ultra-Orthodox parties were concerned that too many of their voters would be out of the country that day, making pilgrimages to the rabbi’s grave in Poland. Giving up on Tuesdays, the lawmakers tentatively agreed on Monday, March 2 — though that falls smack in the middle of the policy conference of Aipac, the pro-Israel lobbying group, a destination for a yearly pilgrimage to Washington by major Israeli politicians. But even a vote on that agreement was held up by haggling between Likud and Blue and White and was unlikely to be decided until Thursday morning. No matter the date, a third election may not be the charm. If that vote also fails to produce a government, Israeli law would mandate a fourth.']","Unable to form a government after two elections, the deeply polarized country will return to the polls for a third time in less than a year."
Conservatives Win Commanding Majority in U.K. Vote: ‘Brexit Will Happen’,2019-12-13,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party won a commanding majority in the British Parliament, a striking victory that redraws the lines in British politics and paves the way for the country’s exit from the European Union early next year. The Conservatives won 365 seats in the House of Commons, versus 203 for the Labour Party, according to the official results. That would give the Conservatives about a 75-seat majority, their largest since that amassed by Margaret Thatcher in 1987. As the results flowed in from individual districts, they pointed to a radical reconfiguration  of Britain’s political map. The Conservative Party was winning dozens of Labour seats in the industrial north and Midlands, shattering the so-called red wall that has undergirded the Labour Party for generations. For Mr. Johnson, whose brief tenure has been marked by serial defeats in Parliament, legal reversals and ceaseless upheaval, it was a resounding vindication. Defying predictions that he would be tossed out of his job, the prime minister is now assured of leading Britain through its most momentous transition since World War II.  For Britain, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the 2016 Brexit referendum, its future seemingly shrouded in perpetual uncertainty, the election provided a rare moment of piercing clarity. “It’s a remarkable victory,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. “Boris Johnson now has five years in power. Brexit will happen. Labour faces an existential question about its future — yet again.” As news of the Conservative victory began to circulate, the pound surged in trading against the dollar and euro, reflecting relief that British politics is likely to stabilize and Britain is more likely to have an orderly departure from the European Union. While the pre-election polls had been predicting a Conservative victory, the news for the party on Thursday was even better than had been forecast, with the Tories projected to gain about 50 seats, in excess of most projections. The Labour Party was set to lose about 60 seats, its worst showing since 1983, and one that seemed likely to lead to the resignation of the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The results, with their seismic shift in the parliamentary power balance, indicated that Mr. Johnson had won his bet that by calling another general election and throwing the question of Brexit back to the British public, he could break the stalemate in Parliament and win a mandate for his policy of a swift withdrawal from the European Union. There were, however, some red flags for Mr. Johnson, who will lead a Britain still deeply divided over Brexit. The Conservatives were tracking to win about 43 percent of the total vote.  The Scottish National Party was projected to win 49 of Scotland’s 59 seats, gaining more than a dozen seats. The party has stridently opposed Mr. Johnson’s drive for a swift Brexit, and its powerful performance could renew calls for a referendum on Scottish independence, which the prime minister opposes. The Conservative Party’s gains among working-class voters in the Midlands and the north could also affect Mr. Johnson’s freedom to negotiate a trade agreement with the European Union. Those voters will push for a revival of Britain’s manufacturing economy and protection from imports, a vision that is at odds with the free-market, deregulatory ethos of Mr. Johnson and his aides. One of Mr. Johnson’s top aides, Priti Patel, the home secretary, said Thursday evening that the new government would introduce legislation to complete Brexit before Christmas, a lightning fast schedule. But Britain’s departure would still not be likely to happen before Jan. 31, the date agreed upon with the European Union. Many in Britain grumbled about having to go to the polls again so soon, especially in the weeks leading up to Christmas, when the weather is cold and the days are short. But the stakes this time could not have been higher. Unlike the 2017 vote, this election clarified Britain’s immediate future for the first time since a narrow majority voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Mr. Johnson’s victory extinguishes the possibility of Britain’s reversing that decision, a dream that has been nurtured by millions who believe that the referendum was a catastrophic error and should be rerun. Polls show a slim majority of people would now favor remaining in Europe, though campaigns for a second referendum have consistently fallen short in Parliament. For the Labour Party, which had lagged the Conservatives in the polls throughout the campaign but seemed to be narrowing the gap in the past few days, it was a devastating defeat. The party struggled to shift the focus during the campaign from Brexit to social issues like health care, which play more to its benefit. One of the most senior Labour Party officials, John McDonnell, acknowledged that Brexit had dominated the campaign, keeping his party on the defensive. Labour had promised to negotiate its own withdrawal agreement with Brussels and then put that to a popular vote. That message was less straightforward than Mr. Johnson’s rallying cry of “Get Brexit Done.”  Neither Labour’s stance on Brexit nor its hard left manifesto of nationalization, tax increases on the rich and huge public spending increases resonated with an electorate that appeared above all to to be ready to turn the page, even if the post-Brexit future is a minefield of uncertainties. Adding to Labour’s problems was the deep personal unpopularity of Mr. Corbyn, who could never recapture the cheerful aura that seemed to surround him in 2017. Nor could he respond effectively to accusations of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in the party. Early Friday morning, Mr. Corbyn said he would not lead the Labour Party in “any future general election campaign,” acknowledging the “very disappointing” defeat. But he said he would stay on as leader for the time being.  Other smaller parties suffered as well, particularly the Liberal Democrats, which campaigned to reverse the results of the Brexit referendum. The party was projected to win only a single seat over what they won in 2017, and would see its total number of seats, which had grown because of defections from other parties, reduced by eight. The party’s leader, Jo Swinson, lost her seat. It is difficult to overstate the shift in Mr. Johnson’s fortunes from a year ago, when he was briefly a back bencher. As a fledgling prime minister in September, he had faced a mutiny from nearly two dozen members of his own party over his threat to leave the European Union without a deal. Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that his decision to suspend the Parliament for five weeks — to squelch its ability to debate his Brexit policy — was illegal. He purged the party dissidents and has largely recast the Conservatives as a band of hard-line Brexiteers. In the campaign, Mr. Johnson stuck to a disciplined strategy, forswearing the clownishness that has characterized his political career. He avoided scrutiny from the news media, declined to be drawn into debates about issues aside from Brexit and conducted his campaign largely on photo opportunities — like when he drove a backhoe through a Styrofoam wall emblazoned with the word, “Gridlock.” Every single Conservative candidate signed a pledge to support Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal agreement, guaranteeing that if his party won even a one-seat majority, Britain would depart the bloc under the terms of that deal. Early Friday, Mr. Johnson said that his government had received “a powerful new mandate to get Brexit done.” Once Parliament gives its approval to the withdrawal deal, Mr. Johnson’s first order of business will be to negotiate a trade agreement with the European Union, a task that many experts predict will be arduous and all but impossible to complete before Britain’s next deadline, Dec. 31, 2020. That sets up another potential battle over extending the deadline — something that Mr. Johnson has sworn not to do — or leaving with no deal.']","The strong showing is vindication for Boris Johnson, who now has a chance to put his personal stamp on Britain, beginning with Brexit."
Bougainville Votes for Independence From Papua New Guinea,2019-12-11,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The region of Bougainville, a collection of islands in the South Pacific, has voted overwhelmingly to become independent from Papua New Guinea, aiming to become the world’s newest nation. In a referendum linked to a peace agreement that ended a civil war between separatists and Papua New Guinea security forces nearly 20 years ago, nearly 98 percent of those who voted supported becoming an independent nation.  Excited voters gathered in Buka to hear the results — and they cheered when the sheer scale of the victory became apparent.  The nearly unanimous results exceeded what regional analysts had expected and could accelerate the independence movement, complicating diplomatic relations across the region.  With such a resounding vote for self-determination, Bougainville has become a visible inspiration for other independence movements in the Pacific, from West Papua, which is seeking to secede from Indonesia, to New Caledonia, which will hold a referendum next year about possibly breaking away from France.  For Bougainville — an area with huge mineral wealth and 250,000 people — the vote also makes it much harder for Papua New Guinea to move slowly through the consultation period required under the 2001 peace agreement that provided a pathway to independence.  “It puts the P.N.G. government in a pretty hard position,” said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. “If there were to be a smaller majority, say 55 or 65 percent, the P.N.G. government could have found a way to justify really stretching this out and having a period of negotiation that could last years or decades. “Now with such a phenomenal majority, it’s much harder for them to do that,” he added. Countries like Australia and New Zealand will also now find themselves squeezed — likely facing pleas for assistance from Bougainville to develop its institutions, and resistance from Papua New Guinea, which has never been eager to give up Bougainville’s bounty.  The islands have struggled against Papua New Guinea’s rule since the 1970s. At the time, Bougainville’s Panguna mine provided nearly half the entire country’s export income through gold and copper mining. But little tax revenue seemed to make it back to Bougainville.  Its economic grievances led the region to declare independence, or try to, in 1975. But Papua New Guinea ignored that push, and over the ensuing decades, tensions simmered and then exploded. Violence shut down the mine in 1989 and a nine-year war claimed the lives of 20,000 people. The Bougainville Peace Agreement granted the region more autonomy, and those who opposed secession hoped the pact’s lengthy timeline — allowing for a nonbinding referendum on independence within 20 years — would also prompt Papua New Guinea’s government to develop an equitable revenue-sharing deal for the mine, along with other services that might build loyalty to the central government. But that never happened.  “The P.N.G. government has squandered its opportunity,” said Wesley Morgan, a fellow at Griffith University’s Asia Institute in Queensland, Australia. Now, Bougainville has the potential to become the world’s newest nation, defining its own destiny and opening itself up to diplomatic and economic partnerships with nations that have shown increased interest in the Pacific as of late — including the United States and China.  “If the process plays out to a point where Bougainville is ceded its independence by the P.N.G. Parliament, then I imagine China would be very quick to offer its support in many ways, with aid, trade and investment,” said Mr. Pryke. “I can imagine they’d be very proactive.” ']",The nearly unanimous results in the Pacific islands chain exceeded expectations and could both accelerate independence and complicate relations across the region. 
Former Turkish Prime Minister Forms Party in Challenge to Erdogan,2019-12-13,By Carlotta Gall,"['ANKARA, Turkey — A former prime minister and erstwhile ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that he was creating a new political party, a challenge that could splinter the governing party and fatally damage the Turkish leader’s chances for re-election. Ahmet Davutoglu, once Mr. Erdogan’s closest ally, served under him as foreign minister and then prime minister until 2016. His break with the Turkish president represents a direct challenge as Mr. Davutoglu pledges a return to the original principles and ideals of their old party. To the cheers and whistles of a large crowd of supporters in a hotel ballroom in Ankara, the capital, Mr. Davutoglu unveiled his Future Party, saying that “the future is our nation’s, the future is Turkey’s.”  He told his supporters to focus not on the pain of past divisions, but on uniting and securing rights for all in the future. A second close ally and former minister, Ali Babacan, has also resigned from Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., and is preparing to announce his own new party within weeks, his supporters say. The two defections will not immediately threaten Mr. Erdogan, since he has amassed enormous personal power with the country’s transition last year to a presidential system. His current term runs to 2023.  But the moves represent the first major break within the governing party and could undermine Mr. Erdogan’s prospects for retaining power. “They will negatively affect the A.K.P.,” said Ali Bayramoglu, an academic and columnist with close ties to the party.  The two challengers could cause a realignment of the center-right conservative vote that has been loyal to Mr. Erdogan, he added. They will join an array of opposition parties whose tactical alliance succeeded in defeating Mr. Erdogan’s supporters in five of Turkey’s largest cities in local elections earlier this year, including Ankara and the country’s largest metropolis, Istanbul. His opponents have declared the loss of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan’s home city and political base, to be the beginning of the end of his 18-year dominance of Turkish politics. Mr. Erdogan has seen his popularity slide to its lowest level in three years, with a currency crash and economic recession that hit 18 months ago testing his leadership. One recent independent poll showed his popularity dropping to 33 percent from 41 percent in July 2018, a level that could see him struggle to secure the majority vote needed for re-election to the presidency, despite his alliance with the National Movement Party. The Turkish Army’s incursion into Syria in October, which was popular at home, gave Mr. Erdogan a temporary boost in the polls, but his ratings fell again as Turks suffered economic hardship and resentment grew over growing economic inequality. In announcing the new party Friday, Mr. Davutoglu offered a reversal of much of Mr. Erdogan’s increasingly autocratic rule, calling for a return to a parliamentary system, the rule of law and freedom of expression.  Mr. Davutoglu, 60, is an academic who has been an influential ideologue within the A.K.P. and has a significant following around the country. Sidelined by Mr. Erdogan in 2016, he had nevertheless remained loyal to the A.K.P., of which he was a founding member, until June of this year, when he broke publicly with Mr. Erdogan over his handling of the Istanbul election. After Mr. Erdogan’s candidate for mayor of Istanbul was defeated in March and he tried to have the vote annulled, Mr. Davutoglu published a devastating critique of Mr. Erdogan’s leadership, assailing his handling of the economy, his amassing of powers under the new presidential system and what he described as a takeover of the party by a narrow clique of self-serving actors. Mr. Babacan, 52, is seen as a successful former finance minister and deputy prime minister who oversaw the economic boom of the early Erdogan years. He is casting himself as the steady pair of hands that can guide Turkey out of its economic crisis, and he has been careful to avoid direct criticism of Mr. Erdogan. Mr. Davutoglu and Mr. Babacan are rivals whose past differences make a joint party impossible, but their efforts are being closely watched to see if they draw support from Mr. Erdogan and tip the balance toward the opposition. Both men aspire to inherit the conservative, religious A.K.P. constituency that Mr. Erdogan has successfully harnessed to stay in power. In the past, Mr. Erdogan has derided and cajoled those who have tried to break away from the A.K.P. But in a sign of how seriously he regards the latest challenge, he has gone on the offensive, branding the two men as traitors and calling Mr. Davutoglu a swindler over a recent property scandal. In a weekend speech to a gathering of party officials, Mr. Erdogan accused Mr. Davutoglu, when he was prime minister, of transferring ownership of public land worth more than $400 million to City University, a private college he had founded. The university used the land as security for a loan from a state bank, Halkbank, but failed to repay the loan, which Mr. Erdogan said amounted to $70 million. “They are trying to swindle Halkbank,” Mr. Erdogan said, including Mr. Babacan and another former minister in his accusation. “Where is your honesty?” Mr. Davutoglu hit back by calling on Mr. Erdogan and other public officials to reveal their personal assets. “The only accusation against me during my term as prime minister is the transfer of land to an educational institution over which I have no personal rights and which I cannot leave to my daughter, my son, my son-in-law or my daughter-in-law,” Mr. Davutoglu said. The timing of the City University revelations was widely perceived as meant to hurt Mr. Davutoglu as he prepared his political challenge. In Mr. Erdogan’s Turkey, the courts and public banks are perceived to be closely controlled by the presidency. Yet Mr. Erdogan has also been damaged by the scandal, since it stems from a period when they were all in government together, political analysts said. Despite the defections, Mr. Erdogan remains the most popular politician in Turkey. He has deftly stirred right-wing, nationalist emotions that run deep, with militaristic ventures in Syria and elsewhere, his calls to restore Turkey to greatness and his frequent challenges to Western powers, said Mr. Bayramoglu, the academic with ties to the A.K.P.']","As President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s popularity sinks along with the economy, onetime allies are trying to lure his supporters.

U.K. Elections Explained: What to Know as Britain Votes,2019-12-11,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — For the second time since Britain voted to withdraw from the European Union, and with the country still deeply divided over the outcome, voters will head to the polls on Thursday for a general election.  With the future of Britain’s status in Europe still undecided after years of haggling, Brexit has inevitably been high on the agenda, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s vow to “get Brexit done” at the core of his Conservative Party’s campaign.  But the opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, has put health care at the center of its pitch to voters, framing itself as the defender of Britain’s revered National Health Service. Labour pledges to increase spending. It’s also arguing that Mr. Johnson could further privatize the service, or accept a trade deal with the United States that might lead to a steep increase in drug prices, claims that Mr. Johnson disputes.  With very different visions for the future of Britain laid out by the leaders of the country’s two main political parties, and several smaller parties also playing potentially decisive roles, here’s what to know ahead of the election.  Voters will be choosing a representative for their local district, or constituency, in Parliament. In total, 650 lawmakers — one for each district — will be chosen as members of the House of Commons, which decides the country’s laws and policies.  Any British citizen or citizen of the Commonwealth or Ireland who is 18 or over and lives in Britain could register to vote. (It’s too late now, though: The deadline was Nov. 26.) Elections are typically held every four or five years, but Parliament can vote to hold a new election whenever it wishes, and this will be the third since 2015. The polls open at 7 a.m. local time and close at 10 p.m., with the results of a usually reliable exit poll announced almost immediately after that. For the official results, all the ballot papers are counted by hand — some districts manage to declare a winner barely an hour after polls close, but most do so overnight. While the Conservative and Labour parties are Britain’s largest, several smaller parties are running candidates.  If one party wins more than half of the parliamentary seats, it will form the government, and its leader will become the prime minister.  For decades, such majority governments were by far the most common result. But that has happened only once in the past three elections. The other two produced “hung Parliaments,” with no party strong enough to govern on its own. In that case, the largest party usually has the first chance to assemble a parliamentary majority and form a government.  It can do so by agreeing to a formal coalition with one or more smaller parties and governing on a joint program, as the Conservatives did with the centrist Liberal Democrats after the 2010 election.  Or it can form a minority government, and seek a looser deal for smaller-party support on critical votes — known as a “confidence and supply” arrangement. The Conservatives struck one of these with a Northern Ireland party, the Democratic Unionists, after the 2017 election. When the results are known — and if a party clearly comes out on top — the head of that party visits Buckingham Palace to ask the queen for permission to form a new government and become the prime minister.  Britons do not vote directly on the prime minister but rather on a politician to represent their district, or constituency. Unlike the proportional systems used in several other European countries, where seats are apportioned according to the share each party receives of the overall vote, British elections are “first past the post”: Each voter has one vote, and the single candidate who gets the most votes in each constituency wins.  That means the winning candidate in any given constituency doesn’t need a majority of the votes,\xa0just more than the next person. And votes for a party nationwide don’t necessarily translate into seats: What counts is how many constituencies a party comes first in. It’s a system both praised and criticized for its ability to turn a plurality of the votes into a single-party government with a majority of parliamentary seats — sometimes, when opposition votes are badly split, a landslide majority. When Prime Minister Theresa May called a surprise early general election in 2017, the opinion polls gave her Conservative Party a lead of at least 20 percentage points on the Labour opposition. Mrs. May set out to expand the narrow parliamentary majority her party had won in 2015, to assure a smooth exit from the European Union.  But things didn’t go quite as planned. Mrs. May suffered a humiliating setback, with her Conservative Party losing its overall majority and instead forced to rely on the 10 votes of the Democratic Unionist Party to retain control in a minority government. The opposition Labour Party saw its support grow substantially, gaining 32 seats, driven in part by a spike in the youth vote. The Conservative Party has established a clear but potentially narrowing lead over the Labour Party in national polls, with Labour appearing to consolidate its support as the country headed into the final stage of the campaign.  On Tuesday, a highly regarded prediction model run by the polling company YouGov suggested the Conservatives were on course for a majority of 28. But analysts, including the ones behind that model, warn that predictions are perilous: 11 seats were decided by less than 100 votes at the last election, and dozens more by a few hundred votes, so a small shift in the right places could change the picture drastically. A recent study from the U.K. Political Studies Association found experts confident that the Conservatives would remain the largest party, but more skeptical of the polling that suggests they will regain an outright majority.  “This cautious prediction of no majority or a very small majority for the Conservatives by the experts may reflect lessons learnt from 2017, when the hung parliament surprised many,”  Joe Greenwood, a fellow at the London School of Economics, wrote of the study. “If the experts are right then 2019 may be a slightly less dramatic, but surprising nonetheless, rerun of 2017, and we are now only a matter of days from finding out.” Tactical voting sees individuals cast a ballot for a candidate they wouldn’t normally support to block another candidate from winning. It’s been a major discussion topic in this election campaign because Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system presents a puzzle for voters who see Brexit as the most important issue.  Those seeking to remain in the European Union are split between several parties. Pro-remain groups have attempted to unite voters behind the most promising pro-European candidate in each constituency — in England, usually from Labour or the Liberal Democrats — amid furious disputes about who has the best chance in certain seats. Pro-Brexit voters, however, appear to have largely united behind the Conservatives. The more radical Brexit Party decided not to stand candidates in Conservative-held constituencies to avoid splitting voters in favor of leaving the European Union between the two parties. ']",British voters will choose their next government on Thursday. But the country’s parliamentary system has a way of throwing up surprises. Here’s what to watch for.
Aung San Suu Kyi Defends Myanmar Against Rohingya Genocide Accusations,2019-12-11,By Marlise Simons and Hannah Beech,"['THE HAGUE — “Intercommunal violence.” Action against “insurgents or terrorists.” Possible — only possible — use of “disproportionate force.” But not genocide. A day after Daw Aung San Suu Kyi listened impassively to searing testimony about the horrors inflicted upon the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar, she took the podium on Wednesday at the United Nations’ highest court to defend her homeland against accusations of genocide, arguing that there had been no orchestrated campaign of persecution. Her statement at the International Court of Justice in The Hague capped a jarring turnabout, decades in the making, for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, from champion of human rights and democracy to apparent apologist for brutality. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her ramrod resistance to the former military dictatorship that held her under house arrest for 15 years. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not directly address the atrocities by Myanmar’s military and associated mobs that were described the day before — summary killings, babies thrown to their deaths, mass rapes, whole villages burned to cinders — all amply documented by the United Nations and human rights groups. Thousands of Rohingya have been killed and three quarters of a million driven into a squalid exile in neighboring Bangladesh. Instead, she insisted that what foreign observers have called an organized, years-long campaign of atrocities against the Rohingya has been exaggerated and misconstrued, whether out of malice or just ignorance. She did not even use the word “Rohingya,” adhering to her government’s stance that no such ethnic group exists. “Genocidal intent cannot be the only hypothesis,” she said on the second day of a three-day hearing, before launching into a litany of ways in which she said her government was trying to lift up the Rohingya from dire poverty.  The defense offered by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, her nation’s de facto civilian leader, was, by any measure, underwhelming, and it seemed unlikely to raise her much-diminished international reputation.  Instead, she went on the offensive against the outside world.  Presenting what many human rights experts have called some of the worst pogroms of this century as part of “cycles of inter-communal violence going back to the 1940s,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi chided foreigners for not having an adequate understanding of Myanmar’s complex ethnic and social history. While saying that it could “not be ruled out” that the Myanmar military may have used “disproportionate force,” or did not “distinguish clearly enough” between rebels and civilians, she criticized “impatient international actors.” “It would not be helpful for the international legal order if the impression takes hold that only resource-rich countries can conduct adequate domestic investigations and prosecutions,” she said. The global community has come to describe the forcible expulsion of Rohingya from Myanmar since 2017 as ethnic cleansing, even genocide. United Nations officials have said the nation’s military generals should be tried for the gravest crimes against humanity. In a landmark lawsuit filed by the West African nation Gambia on behalf of a group of 57 Islamic countries, Myanmar stands accused of genocide. Gambia’s case, which it began presenting to the court on Tuesday, relies on testimony from numerous witnesses and human-rights experts, along with reporting from a United Nations fact-finding mission on Myanmar.  On Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi — who could have left the task to others — presented her country’s rebuttal, giving a spirited defense of the same military brass who had locked her up. She has consistently declined to criticize the generals with whom she has shared power since her party won elections in 2015, although she has allowed that armed forces can be hard-pressed to admit to their own failings.  The violence that began on Aug. 25, 2017, she said, was set off by coordinated attacks on police and army posts by a Rohingya Muslim militant organization and amounted to operations used to “clear a locality of insurgents or terrorists.” “If war crimes have been committed,” she said, “they will be prosecuted within our military justice system.” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, personally, is not a defendant at the International Court of Justice, which rules on disputes between nations over questions of international law. Hours before she began speaking, U Myo Nyunt, the spokesman for her party, the National League for Democracy, dismissed the testimony presented to the court Tuesday as “he said, she said.”  “We have already prepared to rebut these accusations,” Mr. Myo Nyunt said. The United Nations report, he said, “is not complete because of a lack of evidence.”  Myanmar’s government prevented United Nations investigators from going to northern Rakhine, the center of the violence — a fact that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not acknowledge on Wednesday. She said a fact-finding group that she had assembled had collected the most comprehensive record of witness testimony.  Her aides have characterized as fake news various crimes against the Rohingya. Only two isolated cases of killings have been the subject of legal inquiries within Myanmar. Diplomats who have tried to bring up the situation in Rakhine with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi say she cut them off; two of them say she even refused any further one-on-one meetings.  Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations who was asked by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to participate in one of several commissions on Rakhine that she put together, quit in disgust last year after he said she “exploded” in anger at his criticism. “She might have hit me, she was so furious,” he recalled then. The great hall of the International Court of Justice, a polished space of chandeliers and stained glass windows, has been packed with diplomats, activists, lawyers and reporters vying for a glimpse of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. She did not react on Tuesday as Justice Minister Abubacarr M. Tambadou of Gambia opened his country’s case by urging the court to tell Myanmar “to stop this genocide of its own people.” “It is indeed sad for our generation that 75 years after humankind committed itself to the words ‘never again,’ another genocide is unfolding right before our eyes,” he said. “Yet we do nothing to stop it.” Paul Reichler, an American who is the lead lawyer for Gambia’s legal team, addressed the question of whether Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi bore personal responsibility for the deaths of thousands of Rohingya. Her defenders say she is constrained by the military’s continuing grip on some of the most important levers of power in Myanmar.  But Mr. Reichler showed the court a picture of large billboards that have appeared in Myanmar in recent days, showing her superimposed in front of three smiling generals with the caption: “We stand with you.” Mr. Myo Nyunt, the National League for Democracy spokesman, said that the billboards did not mean Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and the military were united. “It just means they are in the same cabinet,” he said. “This case is very delicate and we need to handle the problem gently.”  Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party is facing elections next year, and her attitude toward the Rohingya has broad support in Myanmar. “Unfortunately she has totally taken sides, and she is now whipping up nationalism simply to become more popular,” said U Maung Tun Khin, a Rohingya who traveled to The Hague from London to witness the hearings. Ma Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a youth activist in Myanmar, said support for the National League for Democracy had been flagging in the face of ethnic strife and a struggling economy, but people have rallied around the party over the genocide case. “We can see that the divided political forces inside Myanmar have united to face a lawsuit from a foreign country that is seen as a common enemy,” she  said. Rohingya Muslims have been persecuted for decades in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, gradually losing rights to education, health care and even citizenship. Half a million Rohingya still live in Rakhine, but they have been herded into internment camps or prevented from leaving their villages, even to farm or collect firewood.  Those who have fled to Bangladesh are crowded into the world’s largest refugee camp.  The purpose of this week’s hearing is for the court to decide whether to order measures to protect the Rohingya who remain in Myanmar. A United Nations rapporteur recently warned that “crimes with genocidal intent” were continuing and intensifying in Rakhine.  A ruling on the underlying allegation of genocide could take years. Another case against Myanmar, formerly called Burma, is working its way through another international court. Abdul Malik Mujahid, who heads Burma Task Force U.S.A., part of a coalition of Muslim groups, said he believed that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s presence at the court would backfire by giving renewed exposure to the continuing plight of the Rohingya.  “I’m sure she is doing a disservice to her government and her cause by showing up,” said Mr. Mujahid, an imam who traveled from Chicago to attend the hearing. “The world will pay attention to her, and also to the facts in a legal case that might otherwise get little attention. She is providing infamous star power to the case.” Marlise Simons reported from The Hague, and Hannah Beech from Bangkok. Saw Nang contributed reporting from Mandalay, Myanmar.']","After hearing a roll call of horrors inflicted on Rohingya Muslims, the Nobel laureate explained Myanmar’s case in The Hague. "
"After Election Victory, Boris Johnson Says ‘We Are Going to Unite’",2019-12-13,,"[""Brexit will happen, Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed as he started his postelection era, adding that improving public health care was the nation’s top priority. “We will get Brexit done on time on the 31st of January — no ifs, no buts, no maybes,” Mr. Johnson told a gathering of his supporters early Friday morning.  Hours later, after being formally asked by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, Mr. Johnson made the traditional speech to the nation outside 10 Downing Street, beginning with a claim that Conservatives had “an overwhelming mandate from this election to get Brexit done.” But he followed with a pitch that Labour politicians had made the core of their campaign: The government must improve the cherished but much-diminished National Health Service. “The overwhelming priority of British people right now is that we should focus above all on the N.H.S.” he said. Labour candidates had warned that the Conservatives would harm care by privatizing parts of the health service and striking a trade deal with President Trump that would raise drug prices.  Mr. Johnson repeated his big-spending campaign promises to hire thousands of doctors and tens of thousands of nurses and police officers, to build new hospitals, and create “better infrastructure, better education, better technology.” Striking a conciliatory tone, he said, “we are going to unite and level up” all parts of the country. He acknowledged that Conservatives had won over areas and voters that were long hostile to them and remained wary. “Thank you for the trust you have placed in us, and in me, and we will work around the clock to repay your trust and deliver on your priorities,” he said. With all districts declared,  Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives had won 365 seats — 48 more than they won in the last election, in 2017. The victory is the party’s biggest since Margaret Thatcher captured a third term in 1987 — “literally before many of you were born,” Mr. Johnson told supporters Friday morning. It gives him a comfortable majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. “We did it,” he said on Friday. “We smashed it, didn’t we?” Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party had to reach even farther back to find a more extreme result. It won 203 seats, down 59 from the previous vote, in its worst showing since 1935. It had not suffered a similar drubbing since 1983, when it took 209 seats. The Scottish National Party captured 48 of Scotland’s 59 seats, a gain of 13. The Liberal Democrats, who were hoping to ride an anti-Brexit stance back to prominence, won just 11 seats, one fewer than in 2017. The Conservatives collected 43.6 percent of the popular vote, to 32.2 percent for Labour. That 11.3 percentage point margin was also the largest for the Tories since 1987 — a dramatic shift from 2017, when Labour lost the popular vote by just 2.4 percent. The Scottish National Party’s success immediately intensified the debate over independence for Scotland, which voted against Brexit and has largely rejected Britain’s major parties. Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the party and the Scottish government, said on Friday that in the next week her administration would publish its plan for holding an independence referendum, which the Conservatives oppose. In a 2014 referendum, 45 percent of Scottish voters backed independence. “Scotland has rejected Boris Johnson and the Tories. and yet again we have said no to Brexit,” she said at a news conference. “I accept, regretfully, that he has a mandate for Brexit in England,” she added. “But he has no mandate whatsoever to take Scotland out of the European Union.” A referendum held by Scotland, but not recognized by the government in London, would raise the prospect of the kind of anger and disarray plaguing Spain. There, the government of Catalonia held an independence referendum two years ago that the central government said was illegal.  The Scottish people — not Mr. Johnson — must decide Scotland’s future, Ms. Sturgeon said. “It is clear beyond any doubt that the kind of future desired by the majority in Scotland is very different to that chosen by much of the rest of the U.K.,” she said.   Quim Torra, the separatist leader of Catalonia, congratulated Ms. Sturgeon on Twitter for “magnificent results that demonstrate the democratic will for independence.”  Politicians in Madrid have repeatedly rejected separatist comparisons to Scotland, arguing that Spain’s Constitution guarantees that sovereignty resides with the entire Spanish people. Speaking in his constituency of Islington in London, the Labour Party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said that he would step down before the next general election, but that he would stay at the party’s helm for now, as it reflects on how to move forward from its dismal showing. Mr. Corbyn is under intense pressure to resign. His has been accused of poor leadership and of failing to handle accusations of anti-Semitism in the party ranks. “I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign,” he said. “I will discuss with our party to ensure there is a process now of reflection on this result and on the policies that the party will take going forward, and I will lead the party during that period to ensure that discussion takes place and we move on into the future.” It was not clear how long Mr. Corbyn intends to stay on as party leader. The next election could be as long as five years away. Some Labour Party members were quick to criticize him on Thursday night. “The Labour Party has huge, huge questions to answer,” Ruth Smeeth, a former lawmaker, told Sky News. She immediately laid blame on Mr. Corbyn.  “Jeremy Corbyn should announce that he’s resigning as the leader of the Labour Party from his count today,” she said. “He should have gone many, many, many months ago.” The pound jumped in value on Thursday night, buoyed by the receding prospect of a chaotic exit from the European Union without a divorce agreement. It began Friday near $1.35, up from about $1.32 a day earlier, but gave back most of that gain by late afternoon. Equity markets were similarly lifted by the broad Conservative victory, with the FTSE 250 up more than 4 percent. The FTSE 100, which includes companies that rely more heavily on overseas earnings that would be dampened by a stronger pound, rose less sharply. If the Conservatives manage to pass the withdrawal agreement bill as planned, the gains are likely to hold up through the end of the year, said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. Easing global trade tensions should support markets too, after the United States and China, which have been locked in a trade war, settled on a partial deal. Prospects look more uncertain for the new year. The current deadline gives the British government has just 11 months to negotiate a complex deal on its long-term trading relationship with the European Union. The two sides may struggle to meet the Dec. 31, 2020 deadline, once again raising the prospect of a damaging “no-deal” Brexit. “If negotiators get stuck or bogged down or become more fractious, there’s a prospect of more volatility in the currency,” Mr. Dixon said. “The risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit might keep the market on their toes.” In the longer term, bond yields could also start to edge up if the Scottish secessionist movement gains momentum now that the Scottish National Party has won most of the seats in Scotland. “The one thing which certain investors, maybe bond market investors, will look at again is the integrity of the U.K. following the strong Scottish result for the S.N.P.,” Mr. Dixon added. European leaders on Friday welcomed the clarity of the British election result, which came during the last day of their summit meeting in Brussels, in hopes that it would make way for resolution of the Brexit deal.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson now has the majority needed to ratify his withdrawal agreement with Brussels by the Jan. 31 deadline laid out by Europe. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, congratulated Mr. Johnson on Twitter and said that he expected Britain’s Parliament to vote on the deal “as soon as possible.” But that will only start the clock on new negotiations about Britain’s future trading and security relationship with the bloc. Mr. Johnson has said that the process will be quick and easy, but few experts agree. It can be quick, Brussels argues, only if Britain agrees to keep its regulations and tariffs very close to those of the European Union. European leaders remain unsure whether Mr. Johnson will stick to his campaign pledge to finish any trade negotiation with the European Union by the end of 2020, or choose next summer to seek a year’s delay for longer talks. As long as they are negotiating, Britain is in a “transition” period, and its relationship with the European Union is essentially unchanged, even if it will be legally out of the bloc. Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg’s prime minister, said he hoped that Mr. Johnson would deliver on his campaign promises, as “people need to have clarity.” “I hope that with yesterday’s results, they do,” he said. “The excuse that there is no clear majority in London doesn’t last anymore.” But talks on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union are “not going to be simple,’’ he said. The Conservatives’ resounding win surprised many residents of Kensington, an area of West London that swung from Labour control for the last two years back to its longstanding Tory roots. Most of them seemed to accept Boris Johnson as the lesser evil in an election that presented them with limited options. “I was expecting a hung Parliament,” Brian Thompson, 71, said while walking Florence, a black Giant Schnauzer, just off Kensington High Street on Friday morning. Though not impressed with Mr. Johnson, he called the prime minister “the best out of a poor bunch.” The race for the Kensington seat was one of the closest in the country, as it was in 2017, but the share of the vote going to the two main parties fell sharply. Sebastian Gibson, 43, said he could not stomach either of them, and knew there would be no happy result for him. Mr. Gibson, a property buyer who voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union, voted on Thursday for the Liberal Democrats, who are anti-Brexit. “It’s sad for the country,” he said of the election. Mollie Lotery, 73, said she did not particularly like Mr. Johnson, but saw no real alternative. “I don’t like Labour because I’m Jewish,” she said, in reference to numerous anti-Semitism accusations against the party. “I am delighted at the result.”  “We were excited to watch the election results, but this is bad,” said Mina Aden, 29, a community worker from Ethiopia. “We were expecting Labour would still have Kensington. The Conservatives have never done anything for human rights.” Britain’s businesses welcomed the strong result for the Conservatives and the Brexit certainty that it is expected to bring, at least for now. But they remain fearful of facing another Brexit deadline at the end of next year. “The starting point must be rebuilding business confidence, and early reassurance on Brexit will be vital,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, the country’s biggest business association. Parts of the economy have been in limbo for much of the past three years, as negotiations with the European Union dragged on and Parliament was unable to muster majority support for any one approach. Both the Conservatives and Labour have worried the business community at different points. Labour had promised to nationalize some industries, while Boris Johnson unnerved businesspeople with his determination to plow on with leaving the European Union, even without an agreement. Now, companies want to know that they won’t be staring down another potentially disastrous deadline. “Firms will continue to do all they can to prepare for Brexit, but will want to know they won’t face another no deal cliff-edge next year,” Ms. Fairbairn said. And while the decisive victory paves the way for the next step in the Brexit process, one thing is clear: The postwar push toward greater global economic integration is fading. The British election verdict is not the only sign. In the United States, President Trump’s political base has rallied to his trade war against China. Popular movements across Europe have embraced nationalist and nativist causes that promise to halt globalization.  And the traditional arbiter of trade disputes, the World Trade Organization, is listing toward irrelevance.  “The era of freewheeling markets and liberalism is ending,” said Meredith Crowley, an international trade expert at the University of Cambridge in England.  Britain will have a record number of female members of Parliament after Thursday’s vote, when women won at least 220 of the 650 seats, according to the Press Association. At just over one-third of the House of Commons, women remain far short of parity with men, but they have made tremendous gains since the mid-1980s, when there were only 23 in Parliament. In the last general election, in 2017, women won 211 seats, a record at the time. This year’s increase comes at a time when many people feared that women were being driven away from politics in a climate of heightened divisions. Online threats and abuse have risen sharply and were disproportionately directed at female candidates. Ahead of the campaign, more than a dozen prominent female lawmakers said they would not stand for re-election citing that abuse as a reason for stepping away from politics.  Many female candidates described threats and insults as a grim new reality on the campaign trail, a change that cast a harsh light on British politics. An analysis of Twitter during the campaign, conducted by PoliMonitor, showed that all candidates received about four times as much abuse as in the 2017 election. The hostility aimed at women, the study said, was often based specifically on their sex or appearance.

"With Many Dents to Its Image, Nobel Peace Prize Is Hit With a Few More",2019-12-11,By Rick Gladstone,"['[View the latest updates to the 2020 Nobel Prize winners list.] The Nobel Peace Prize has long been contentious, beginning with its origins in the will of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century inventor of dynamite. But it is extraordinary that two winners are almost simultaneously battling accusations of behavior that is widely regarded as antithetical to the spirit and purpose of the award, first given in 1901.  On Wednesday, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar leader who won the prize in 1991, appeared before the International Court of Justice and denied accusations that her government had committed genocide against the Rohingya minority. Her defense of Myanmar at the court was a jarring contrast to her onetime identity as an intrepid  champion of human rights and democracy. And on Tuesday, the 2019 winner, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia, facing accusations of a heavy-handed crackdown on political protests, skipped a news conference after his acceptance speech. In some years, critics have questioned the worthiness of winners without marquee accomplishments — like the 2012 award to the European Union, for example, or the 2009 award to President Barack Obama, just months into his first term.  In other instances — perhaps most famously the 1973 award to Henry A. Kissinger and his North Vietnamese counterpart, Le Duc Tho, as the Vietnam War was still raging — the track records of winners have been ridiculed. (The singer Tom Lehrer famously said that the choice of Mr. Kissinger had rendered political satire obsolete.) In the case of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, some critics have suggested that the criteria for selecting winners should be reassessed — including the possibility that the honor could be rescinded. Such questions are inherent to the prize regardless who is chosen, said Dr. Richard B. Gunderman, a professor  at Indiana University who has written about the prize’s history.  “The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize has always been fraught with peril, subject to the current drift of public opinion and political and nationalistic motives and prejudices,” Dr. Gunderman said.  “Like all human judgments, the Nobel committee’s decisions are prone to error,” he said. “It should do the best it can and then live with the consequences.”  Here are some other notably contentious Nobel Peace Prize nominees and winners: Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939 by a member of Sweden’s Parliament, E.G.C. Brandt, who apparently meant it as a satire against the leader of Nazi Germany, and never intended the choice to be seriously considered. But the nomination created such outrage that it was quickly withdrawn.  Joseph Stalin, Hitler’s nemesis and the leader of the Soviet Communist Party, was nominated twice — in 1945 and 1948 — for his efforts to end World War II. Despite Stalin’s murderous purges and pogroms, those nominations were taken in earnest.  The American statesmen Cordell Hull won in 1945 for his role in establishing the United Nations. Six years earlier, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s secretary of state, he took steps that led Roosevelt to deny permission for 950 Jewish refugees aboard the liner St. Louis, fleeing Nazi persecution, to seek asylum in the United States.  Many of the passengers on the trip, known as the Voyage of the Damned, later died in the Holocaust. The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization shared the 1994 prize with the Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for the Oslo Accords, still widely regarded as the basis for a peace process. But many critics assailed the choice of Mr. Arafat because of his role in acts of terrorism against Israelis. The 1973 prize was awarded to Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnam statesman Le Duc Tho for having negotiated a cease-fire in the Vietnam War.  Many critics of the war — which would not be over for two more years — ridiculed the choice of Mr. Kissinger, and his Vietnamese counterpart refused to accept the award on grounds that the United States had violated the cease-fire.  An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s Nobel Peace Prize. She received it in 1991, not 1994.']","Myanmar’s onetime champion of democracy and Ethiopia’s prime minister join a roster of figures who, one way or another, have given the Nobel Peace Prize a contentious image.

"Who Keeps Europe’s Farm Billions Flowing? Often, Those Who Benefit",2019-12-11,By Matt Apuzzo and Selam Gebrekidan,"['BRUSSELS — One morning this spring, lawmakers crowded into a committee room filled with staffers, lobbyists and environmentalists to vote on a flurry of bills that would set the course for the European Union’s $65-billion-a-year farm policy. For critics of the subsidy system, one item was of special interest. It was known as the “Babis Amendment,” after Andrej Babis, the billionaire agriculturalist and prime minister of the Czech Republic. It was designed to prohibit politicians who hand out European Union farm subsidies from receiving the funds themselves. Mr. Babis is Exhibit A of how the system benefits the wealthy and connected. His government shapes agricultural subsidy policies in the Czech Republic. It also gave $42 million in European subsidies last year to his domestic companies, according to a New York Times analysis. His holdings in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia received another $7 million. “The vote is open,” the agricultural committee chairman declared.  Eleven seconds passed.  Then the chairman simply said: “Rejected.” Nobody read the proposal aloud. There was no debate. And nobody mentioned one relevant fact: that half of the 46 committee members had ties to the farm industry. Several lawmakers received thousands of dollars in subsidies. The Babis Amendment could have jeopardized their money, too.  The European Union’s farm program is one of the largest subsidy schemes in the world. It represents 40 percent of the European budget — money that is meant to support farmers and sustain rural communities. Yet it is opaque in key areas, with gaping shortcomings in accountability. In November, a New York Times investigation revealed that the subsidies underwrite oligarchs, mobsters and far-right populists. The Times also showed that some national leaders use the money to enrich friends, political allies and family members. Such abuses succeed in part because of a system in Brussels that favors those who earn the most from the subsidies. Not only do they play an outsized role in setting policies, they also benefit from murky conflict-of-interest rules, weak lobbying-disclosure laws and a haphazard accountability system in which cases can drag on for years even when outright fraud is discovered. Agricultural lobbyists, among the most influential in Europe, have exclusive, closed-door access to government leaders. Conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the ministers who vote on legislation. And members of the European Parliament are not prohibited from writing the laws for the very subsidies they receive. “The powerful people who have land and the powerful people in government work together,” said Maria Noichl, a German member of the European Parliament who sponsored the Babis Amendment. “They both benefit from the program, and most people don’t know how it works.” Renewing the seven-year farm bill is one of the top priorities on the European agenda. Debate will intensify next year when the European Parliament and council consider whether to grant national leaders like Mr. Babis greater flexibility over how the money is spent. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, only to face lambasting in the Parliament. For years, European leaders have been warned that the subsidies encourage corruption, harm the environment and underwrite land-grabbing. Yet major change remains difficult when so many lobbyists, lawmakers and farm officials want to keep the system intact. Andrej Babis became prime minister of the Czech Republic promising to run the state like a business. But he is often accused of running the state as if it were his business. After the end of the Cold War, Mr. Babis was among the former communists who bought up what remained of the old order. He built his empire through a relentless acquisition of farms, fertilizer companies, tractor suppliers and silos. In an industry dominated by big players, his company, Agrofert, is the biggest.  “I made it from nothing,” Mr. Babis said in an interview in New York. But his companies also have benefited from policies approved by governments that he has led or served in, prompting years of investigations over conflicts of interest, even as Agrofert continued to collect subsidies. When Mr. Babis was finance minister and deputy prime minister from 2014 to 2017, small farmers complained that they lost influence on a board that monitors and helps guide national policies for handing out farm subsidies. “So you can imagine what kind of a decision process takes place there,” said Jan Stefl, a 59-year-old Czech farmer. “It always favors the big farmers.”  Journalists then revealed that Mr. Babis had created a shell company that collected $2 million in European agricultural grants intended for small businesses. In 2017, European investigators and the Czech police recommended that he be prosecuted for fraud. But soon after that recommendation, Mr. Babis was elected prime minister. Prosecutors said they would review the investigative file. Two years later, they dropped the case. Last week, they reopened it. That is common because European fraud investigators must work with local authorities to conduct most investigations. They can recommend charges but cannot file those charges themselves. And national prosecutors act on those recommendations only 36 percent of the time, officials said this year. “We are doing everything from our part,” a European Union spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said. “We’re not here to replace every single government in the E.U.” A European prosecutor’s office is being created next year to take up such cases, though some countries opted not to participate. That includes Hungary, where the prime minister’s family and friends have reaped millions in farm subsidies. In the Czech Republic, Mr. Babis has benefited from national laws that channel more European money to his companies. One rule that purports to limit runaway subsidy spending has instead created clear advantages for his company. The rule limits farmers to one grant application a year. But a company like Agrofert, which has at least 100 domestic subsidiaries, can apply many times. Mr. Babis said in the interview that he had nothing to do with those rule changes. He said the Czech government, regardless of political party, had for years supported large-scale farming. The European Union introduced stricter conflict-of-interest rules last year, but it is still unclear whether they cover heads of government like Mr. Babis. When a Czech politician asked for clarification last year, Europe’s top budget official replied that the answer required “a case-by-case analysis.” Using a Czech conflict-of-interest law, though, European investigators audited grants paid to Mr. Babis’s business this year. They found that even though Mr. Babis had put Agrofert into two trusts, he still controlled the company and therefore violated Czech law. The auditors ordered the Czech government to return all the money paid to Agrofert from European regional development and social funds, according to a leaked report obtained by the Czech news organization Denik N and shared with The Times. Mr. Babis said that he intended to return to Agrofert once he is out of office. So, if Agrofert benefits from his government’s policies, he ultimately stands to profit. But he assailed the audits, calling them “an attack on the Czech Republic” and labeling their authors incompetent. The appeals process is expected to take months. In the meantime, Mr. Babis is scheduled to join other elected national leaders on the European Council, which will meet in secret to set the European Union budget in the coming months. Czech opposition leaders have called for Mr. Babis to be excluded from that vote. One senator, Lukas Wagenknecht, urged European officials to stop paying “an East-European oligarch to establish a nondemocratic autocracy.” Mr. Babis is confident that he will be exonerated. “Nobody can corrupt me,” he said. “I’m quite a rich guy.” The defeat of the Babis Amendment barely registered with the most important lobbyists in the room. They had their eyes on the bigger picture: keeping the subsidy system intact, with as much money as possible. As long as there has been farm money, Copa-Cogeca, Europe’s largest organization for farmers, has swayed where it goes. European leaders have historically treated the group not as mere recipients of government money, but as partners in policymaking. Much has changed in recent decades: Environmental concerns have become a priority and farming has shrunk to 1 percent of Europe’s economy. Yet even today, Copa-Cogeca enjoys special access that would make others swoon. “On the subsidies, they are more powerful than anyone,” said Gérard Choplin, an agricultural policy expert and former lobbyist. Before meetings of European farm ministers, for example, the council president grants a private audience to Copa-Cogeca. That lets farm lobbyists — and only farm lobbyists — make their views heard before key decisions are made.  When environmental groups requested similar access last year, they were rebuffed. A council representative told them that Copa’s meeting was a matter of tradition, “to facilitate an exchange of information.” Lobbyists are not required to register in Brussels and the capital is filled with events bringing them together with policymakers. Staff members from Copa-Cogeca, the agricultural company Bayer and the European Commission formed a group called the Young Food Policy Network, which hosts happy hours for government and business officials. This is not lobbying, staffers said, just people having drinks. Copa-Cogeca draws its influence largely from the national farm unions, which can cause political headaches. This year in France, farmers blockaded roads and dumped tons of manure outside the office of a member of Parliament in a protest over a trade deal. Copa-Cogeca officials make no apologies for being advocates for their industry. They say farmers are expected to hold down food prices, keep quality high and fight climate change — all while dealing with a panoply of regulations and a shrinking farm budget. They say they have accepted years of reforms but will not accept anything that hurts the industry’s bottom line. “We cannot be green if we are in the red,” Pekka Pesonen, the group’s secretary general, said this year. Lawmakers hear that message often. Lobbyists in Brussels are free to roam the committee room floor, and Ms. Noichl of Germany said she hesitated to talk to her colleagues there. “There’s too many people listening,” she said. Soon after defeating the Babis Amendment, the committee prepared to vote on the full subsidy bill. It gave leaders like Mr. Babis new spending flexibility. Most important, it declared that the subsidy budget should not be cut. Before opening the vote, the committee chairman, Czeslaw Siekierski of Poland, paused for a reminder. “European farmers are watching us very closely,” he told his colleagues. “And we must make sure that we can deliver.” The vote passed. To many, Mr. Babis has become a symbol of conflict-of-interest in the subsidy system. But lesser-known government officials also have a stake in the policies they vote on. Among the lawmakers who killed the Babis Amendment were Mairead McGuinness of Ireland, whose family received $28,000 in subsidies last year; Peter Jahr of Germany, who received $15,600; and John Stuart Agnew of Britain, who disclosed receiving between $13,000 and $66,000 from a company that is paid subsidies. Lawmakers said they saw no problem with their vote. Ms. McGuinness said the bill would have unfairly punished farmers whose family members entered politics. Mr. Jahr noted that all lawmakers are affected by some laws, like taxes. “To a certain extent, it is inherent to the system,” he said. If the European Parliament disagrees, nobody is saying so. Its conflict-of-interest rule is vague and leaders have taken no position on whether members can vote on and receive subsidies. The responsibility for identifying conflicts, a Parliament spokeswoman said, “lies primarily with the member.” So reports about lawmakers receiving subsidies become background noise. “They vote on the money, and they and their families get the money,” Ms. Noichl said. And the members of another governing body, the Council of the European Union, are not subject to a conflict-of-interest policy at all. It comprises ministers from all 28 countries, who vote on legislation. Members of the Council are presumed to be representing their national governments, not themselves.   This means that Mr. Babis’ farm minister, Miroslav Toman, can vote on subsidy policy even though his brother and father run an agricultural company that was among the biggest Czech subsidy recipients last year. “Everyone has a stake in keeping the status quo,” said Alan Matthews, a  farm policy expert at Trinity College Dublin. Experts agree that one way to curtail abuses and address inequities would be to limit how much each person receives. Another would be to reconsider a formula that pays farmers based on how much land they hold. Franz Fischler, a former European agricultural commissioner, said he had tried more than 15 years ago to accomplish both. But Britain, where aristocrats own huge tracts of land, opposed the idea, Mr. Fischler said. So did Germany, home to large Soviet-style farms in what was once East Germany.  When his proposal died, Mr. Fischler warned that as the European Union expanded, the subsidies would widen the gap between rich and poor. “This is exactly where we are now,” he said. Even today, 23 of the 28 agricultural ministers who will vote on the farm bill have said they oppose a cap. “There is no real change,” said Ms. Noichl, the German lawmaker. “Not in Europe. In Europe it’s always the same.” The European Union can and does claw back misspent money. But veteran investigators ruefully joke that often the only penalty for stealing is having to return the money. For example, European investigators say they unraveled a scheme involving a Brussels-based company that received millions of dollars to promote Bulgarian agricultural products. The firm colluded with Bulgarian companies, inflated invoices and laundered money through shell companies, according to documents and current and former officials. The authorities identified a European official, Georgios Malliaris, who received cash from the scheme, according to the officials. Mr. Malliaris did not respond to repeated messages. Investigators recommended charges two years ago against the companies and Mr. Malliaris. European officials are working to recover the money from Bulgaria, but the authorities have not prosecuted any of the companies. A sealed criminal case against Mr. Malliaris and others is winding through the Belgian judicial system, current and former officials said. Until that case is resolved, European Union officials cannot take action against Mr. Malliaris. So he remains employed and has been moved to an archiving job.

He Wanted to Be Pope. He Settled for Conducting the Metropolitan Opera.,2019-12-13,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — When the conductor \u200b\u200bYannick Nézet-Séguin was 10, he went to the basement of the family house, put on one of his parents’ vinyl records, held a yellow pencil aloft and began to conduct the first movement of Mozart’s Symphony No. 40, over and over again. For the previous four years, the boy, obsessed by the rituals and pageantry of the Roman Catholic Church, had gone to the basement every day to conduct Mass by himself, earnestly telling his parents he wanted to become pope. So when he went upstairs to announce his new vocation, his mother and father, engaged in a game of after-dinner bridge, were \u200bamused. “I was abnormally intense,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin, now 44, said with a laugh in between rehearsals at the Place des Arts concert hall in Montreal. “At that moment, my fascination with reli\u200bg\u200bion was transferred to music and the liturgical aspect of the church became the ritual of the concert. My parents said, ‘Oh, whatever. In two weeks, you’ll want to become an astronaut.’ But I never changed my mind.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who sometimes bleaches his short-cropped hair a vivid blond, has not disappointed his 10-year-old self. Last year, he became the third official music director in the history of the Metropolitan Opera in New York (“I expected his ‘Traviata’ to be good, but not this good,” wrote The Times’s chief classical music critic of the first opera that Mr. Nézet-Séguin conducted in his new post). Mr. Nézet-Séguin is also music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and conductor-for-life at the Montreal-based Orchestre Métropolitain. The triple role can be punishing for Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who shuttles frequently between the three cities and to recording sessions and about 120 concerts a year. But the indefatigable maestro, who communes with classical music scores even while in the bathtub, said that he also required solitude. He decompresses by swimming, listening to the French diva Dalida and drinking champagne. “Yes, I am very busy and high energy, but I am not hyperactive,” he said, switching seamlessly between French and English. “The loneliness of studying a score is one of the things that attracted me to becoming a conductor.”  Mr. Nézet-Séguin retains a deep affection and loyalty for his hometown, Montreal, where he got his start. At 21, he conducted Bach’s “St. John Passion” in a former church. It was his first public concert with a choir and instruments. He was so overcome, he said, that he could feel himself floating up to the chapel’s ceiling. “I felt as if I was levitating,” he recalled. More than two decades later, he appeared similarly elated when his Orchestre Métropolitain, long in the shadow of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, premiered at Carnegie Hall on a recent evening. When the audience erupted in a standing ovation after a haunting performance of Anton Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony, his eyes moistened with emotion.  For years, there was speculation that, as his stature soared, he would abandon the Montreal orchestra, which he began conducting at age 25. But Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he was determined to remain connected to his Quebec roots and to an orchestra he calls “my family,” in which his partner, Pierre Tourville, plays viola. Mr. Nézet-Séguin cites his native Quebec as a reason for his informal and egalitarian conducting style. “Our ancestors are mostly peasants and farmers, and there has long been a distrust of authority,” he said.  A mixture of decisiveness and gentle cajoling was on display in a recent rehearsal of the Orchestre Métropolitain for a performance of Berlioz’s “Harold in Italy.” Wearing sweatpants, a black T-shirt and running shoes, he used his whole body to express the music’s sweep, rising up and down on his toes on the podium with balletic athleticism.  “Too fast,” he told the brass section at one point. He sang out how he wanted the phrasing. He addressed all the players and not just the principal musicians. “Let’s return to that musical orgy part,” he said during a pause, eliciting laughter from the musicians, who addressed him as “Yannick.” Finally satisfied, he gave two thumbs up. Mr. Nézet-Séguin says he believes that conducting has too often been dominated by black-tailed deities. “The aim of my conducting is to elicit emotions from my players,” he said. “Being demanding is not the same thing as making people afraid.” Jean Paquin, a French horn player at the Orchestre Métropolitain who has known Mr. Nézet-Séguin for two decades, said that when the conductor arrived at age 25, some players had been skeptical. But Mr. Nézet-Séguin quickly convinced the doubters with his humility, his passion for the music and his “expressive, supernatural left hand,” Mr. Paquin said. Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he had always admired Leonard Bernstein, “primarily because there was never a note that was not filled with intention or emotion.” Then there was his “maestro,” the Italian conductor Carlo Maria Giulini, whose music Mr. Nézet-Séguin discovered as a boy before studying with him in the late 1990s. “He was very calm and never used harsh words,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. He added that he was determined to bring such equanimity to the Metropolitan Opera after “troubled times.” In 2018, Mr. Nézet-Séguin became the Met’s music director after the previous holder of the role, James Levine, was fired over allegations of sexual abuse that he denied. Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s aim for the Met, he said, was a new era of optimism through a “quiet revolution,” an allusion to a 1960s social movement in Quebec against the strictures of the Catholic Church. “I don’t believe in arriving at an institution and being a disrupter,” he said. “There is some resistance — I am not saying it’s always easy — but smiles and optimism are what is needed.” Born in Montreal into a churchgoing family, Mr. Nézet-Séguin gave credit to his parents, both professors of education, for accepting their gay son and for giving him the confidence to be himself, on and off the podium.  His parents, in an interview in New York, said he was a born performer, putting on musical shows for his two elder sisters, dancing to Michael Jackson hits and constantly drawing. At age 12, he began studying piano, composition and chamber music at the Conservatoire de Musique in Montreal, before founding his own orchestra and Baroque choir, La Chapelle de Montréal. “I never really properly studied conducting. I developed as a musician and eventually conducting became an extension of that,” he said. His father, Serge Séguin, said that when his son was 15, he had persuaded him to pay 600 Canadian dollars, about $520 at the time, to go to Montreal’s towering Courthouse and add his mother’s maiden name, Nézet, to his surname. Séguin is a common name in Quebec, and the teenager thought that a double-barreled name would help him stand out as an artist. “He had a vision of what was necessary to accomplish his ambitions,” Mr. Séguin said. “At that age, he was already thinking of his future on the global stage.” In 2000, Mr. Nézet-Séguin became conductor of the Orchestre Métropolitain. He recalled that when Mr. Tourville, his partner, had tried out for the ensemble from behind a curtain, he had recognized his viola playing immediately. “It was the warmth,” he said. The two met as students at the Conservatoire and Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who had a girlfriend at the time, said the relationship had gradually blossomed. Being an openly gay conductor, he added, was still woefully rare. “I want to be a role model for young people,” he said. Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s big break as a conductor came in 2008 at the internationally celebrated Salzburg Festival, where he conducted Gounod’s “Romeo and Juliette Overture.” He was so nervous at one public dress rehearsal that he began by conducting the wrong piece, “The Flying Dutchman” by Wagner,  he said. But his performance turned out to be a triumph, propelling his international career and leading to appearances with the world’s greatest opera houses and orchestras. Conducting, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said, sometimes required embracing the unexpected. Once, at the end of a performance in Montreal of the Alban Berg opera “Wozzeck,” he recalled, a musician’s cellphone played a honky-tonk tune just as the opera was ending with a boy dancing with a hobby horse. “It matched the scene onstage so well that people said, ‘Oh my God, this is genius!’” he said. Too many of today’s conductors, he added, were too controlling. “The danger is to become too dry, too academic,” he said, “That the mind takes too much space compared to the heart.”']",The Quebec-born music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin has soared to the peak of his profession thanks to his precocious talent and a belief in “smiles and optimism.”
"Subduing Terrorist on London Bridge, He Was Prepared to Die",2019-12-12,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — A woman’s scream was the first sign John Crilly had of a terrorist attack. For a moment, he wasn’t sure it signaled real distress, he said, but then “it got a lot louder, a lot more intense.” It sounded like they were both in the same building, the historic Fishmonger’s Hall on the north bank of the River Thames. Rushing to investigate, he saw Saskia Jones, wounded and “sprawled across the stairs with her arms out,” recalled Mr. Crilly, who would be hailed as a hero of the deadly episode on Nov. 29 that ended on London Bridge.  Her attacker, Usman Khan, stood at the bottom of the staircase, a knife in each hand. Mr. Khan said “something like, ‘kill everyone,’ or ‘going to kill you,’ or something about killing people,” Mr. Crilly, 48, told the BBC in an emotional interview published on Thursday. Risking his own safety, he went at the killer, armed with only the improvised tools at hand — first a wooden lectern, and then a fire extinguisher — as the clash began in a central London building and then spilled out into the street.  He saw that Mr. Khan was wearing what looked like an explosive suicide belt, though it turned out to be a fake.  “I’m just basically screaming at him to blow it,” Mr. Crilly recalled, “like calling his bluff.” He said Mr. Khan, a convicted terrorist, replied that he was waiting to detonate the device until after the police arrived.  “I was prepared to probably lose my life — yeah, I think I was,” Mr. Crilly said. He and Mr. Khan, 28, both former prison inmates, had gone to a conference held by Learning Together, a prisoner education and reform program created by Cambridge University.  Also there were Ms. Jones, 23, and Mr. Crilly’s friend Jack Merritt, 25, recent Cambridge graduates who were passionate advocates for inmates. Mr. Khan fatally stabbed Mr. Merritt, a Learning Together supervisor who had worked with Mr. Crilly, and Ms. Jones, a volunteer for the program, and wounded others. Mr. Crilly and several other people tried to subdue him, and gave chase as the attacker ran from the building and onto London Bridge, scattering the usual weekday throng of pedestrians. Mr. Crilly sprayed him with the fire extinguisher. Another man poked at the attacker with a narwhal tusk he had pulled from a display in the hall, and another hit him with a pole.  While Mr. Khan slashed at them, they managed to wrestle him to the sidewalk and take away at least one of his knives. When the police arrived, Mr. Crilly told the BBC, “it seemed like ages before they shot him.” “I did scream, as well, to shoot him,” he said, “just in case he blew the belt.” At least one officer fired, killing Mr. Khan. Mr. Khan had pleaded guilty to plotting terrorist attacks, and served eight years in prison. After claiming to have changed his views, he was released last December. Mr. Crilly served 13 years. He and a partner broke into a home in Manchester, where they encountered a 71-year-old man who lived there. According to the BBC, the other burglar punched the resident, killing him. Under Britain’s joint enterprise law, Mr. Crilly was convicted of murder as well as burglary, along with his co-defendant, and sentenced to life in prison.  But Britain’s Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the law had been interpreted wrongly for years. Mr. Crilly, who completed a law degree in prison, became the only person so far to have a joint enterprise murder conviction overturned under that ruling, and he was released last year. HMr. Crilly told the BBC that Mr. Merritt had changed his life. “He actually listened, and you could tell he was really, genuinely interested,” he said. “Jack just basically meant hope.” Mayor Sadiq Khan of London later cited “the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran toward danger, not knowing what confronted them.”  But Mr. Crilly said he did not see himself as a hero. “Jack gave up his life,” he said, closing his teary eyes as his voice broke. “He would be my hero.”']","John Crilly, a former inmate, pursued the terrorist and sprayed him with a fire extinguisher, slowing his advance.

Smuggled Iranian Gas and a Predawn Dash Lead to Fiery Crash That Kills 13,2019-12-13,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least 13 people were killed in a fiery collision between a passenger bus and a pickup truck carrying smuggled Iranian gasoline early Friday in southwestern Pakistan, officials said. The deadly collision happened around 4 a.m. Friday in Killa Saifullah, a remote district in Baluchistan Province. “Thirteen people were burned to death in the collision. One person miraculously survived without any injuries,” Atiqur Rehman, the deputy commissioner of the district, said in a telephone interview. The official said it was raining and snowing around 2:30 a.m. on Friday when officials received information about the movement of four Datsun pickup trucks carrying smuggled Iranian gasoline in the district. “They were intercepted by law enforcing authorities, but one pickup truck managed to break through the security cordon,” he said. “Later, we learned that there had been an accident of a bus and the pickup truck.” The commuter bus was traveling from Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab Province to Quetta, Baluchistan’s provincial capital. Both vehicles caught fire and fell into a 10-foot ditch after the collision. Smuggled Iranian fuel is typically much less expensive than legally sold fuel in Pakistan, and Pakistani officials have long struggled to stamp out its sale. In Mr. Rehman’s district alone, the authorities confiscated 15,000 liters (about 4,000 gallons) of Iranian fuel just last month, he said.  The smugglers move late in the night, sometimes in small convoys of old pickup trucks filled with oil cans, he said. Despite being rich in natural resources, and the site of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese development projects, Baluchistan is one of the most troubled places in Pakistan. The security forces have used a heavy hand in fighting a long-running insurgency there, Islamist militant groups often target the Shiite minority population, and much of the Afghan Taliban leadership is still based in Quetta.  Officials say that smuggling has long been a factor in Baluchistan, aided by the province’s badland borders with Iran and Afghanistan, and driven by deep poverty and unemployment among residents.  “They are playing with fire only because they are very desperate,” Dr. Jehanzeb Jamaldini, a senator from Baluchistan Province, said of the poverty problem.  Senator Jamaldini said that the government had not done a good job providing alternative jobs and better economic conditions in Baluchistan, creating an opening for the sale of cheaper Iranian gasoline that should be allowed anyway to benefit residents.  But Pakistani officials say that smuggled Iranian fuel drains around $400 million from Pakistan’s economy each year.  An official of the Pakistan State Oil company told the country’s Senate this year that smuggled Iranian oil was still easily available in Quetta, the provincial capital, and elsewhere in the province.  “We have to shut down 159 petrol outlets in Baluchistan where Iranian petrol is freely available at fuel stations, and it is cheaper,” Umar Shafi, the official, was quoted as saying by the local news media. The smuggled gasoline also finds its way to other Pakistani provinces, including Sindh Province and the economic hub city of Karachi.']","In remote Pakistan, a fuel-loaded pickup that had evaded the police collided with a passenger bus around 4 a.m., officials say."
Iraqi Protesters Lynch Teenager While Police Stand By,2019-12-12,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — The antigovernment protests that have shaken Iraq for months took a brutal turn on Thursday when protesters lynched a 16-year-old boy who had fired a pistol in the air to try to shoo them away from his family’s home.  The protesters stabbed him 17 times, hung him by his ankles from a traffic light pole and cut his throat. In videos of the scene, people in police uniforms can be seen in the midst of the mob, seemingly allowing the attack to take place.  The rare outburst of violence by the protesters underscored the increasing tension on the streets after the killing of more than 400 protesters by government forces and a recent spate of attacks by other groups, while the absence of a response by either the police or bystanders, many of whom recorded the killing on their cellphones, raised questions about the complicity of Iraqi society. The Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights condemned the police behavior as well as the lack of any effort by citizens to stop the violence. “The presence of hundreds if not thousands of citizens who stood still, filming and watching is a dangerous development that confirms the society’s acceptance of violence,” said Ali al-Bayati, a commission member.  The protests have been driven by anger over political corruption, unemployment and Iranian influence in Iraqi politics. The protests forced Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to resign last month, and the government has struggled to respond to the protesters’ demands. The lynching victim, identified as Haitham Ali Ismael, had been berating protesters for three days for obstructing the street beside his house and making noise, but he had been largely ignored. On Thursday, witnesses said, he climbed onto the roof of his house and began shooting into the air with a pistol.  The protesters, apparently under the impression that he had killed someone, stormed his house, joined by a large number of unemployed people and children who looked as if they were barely adolescents. In video of the attack, the crowd can be heard chanting, “The blood of the martyrs will not be spilled in vain,” suggesting that they believed he had killed one or more protesters. The crowd barged into the small house at the edge of Al Wathba Square, where Mr. Ismael lived with his mother, and began stabbing him. The protesters took him outside, pulling off his clothes and dragging him bleeding through the streets.  “I was standing there when they hung this young man by a rope and tied him to the pole,” said Fadhil Muhammad, 25, a tuk-tuk driver. “Then the rope was cut and the victim’s head fell on screws on the ground in the street and they entered into his head.” Then they threw the boy on the bed of a police pickup truck, Mr. Muhammad said, “and in front of the police they began to slash his neck.” “Unfortunately Haitham had been fighting with these guys for three days because of their shouting and gathering near his house, but I did not expect it to reach to the point of killing him,” Mr. Muhammad said. “He was still a young man.”  Abu Mohammad Alkinani, 45, a fruit and vegetable seller, said he knew the boy and had “never heard anything bad” about him. “It was a painful scene, may God help his mother, and I wonder why the police did not do anything,” Mr. Alkinani said. “Maybe tomorrow this thing could happen with me and no one would help me.”  The leaders of the protest in Tahrir Square, the center of the protest movement, quickly distanced themselves from the attack and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.  “We went out peacefully for reforms and to stop the bloodshed and to put criminals in the hand of the judiciary,” they said in a statement released on social media.  “What happened today at Al Wathba Square is a crime condemned by the demonstrators and condemned by humanity and punishable by law,” the statement said. In videos, Iraqi police officers can be seen hurrying through the square as if they were disturbed by what was going on but perhaps afraid to interfere.  A police leader from the area, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, expressed a sense of powerlessness.  The attackers were slashing the boy’s throat while he was in the police truck, he said, and there was little the police could do. General Khalid al-Muhanna, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied allegations on some Iraqi websites that the riot police had entered the boy’s house and perhaps participated in stabbing him, but he did not respond to criticism of the absence of any effort by police to stop the bloody free-for-all.  “It is not true that the anti-riot forces attacked the house of the young man,” he said. “It was the demonstrators who did it, some of them wearing uniforms like those of the anti-riot police.”  The protests are now in their 10th week, and winter is coming on. The nights are cold and some days are rainy, worsening the conditions for the protesters, many of whom are living in deserted buildings and makeshift tents. At the same time, the nature of the violence has shifted.  Initially much of the shooting — whether with bullets or lethal tear gas canisters — was carried out by the Iraqi security forces, primarily special units including the Quick Reaction Forces, whose leadership is close to Iran.  In the last couple of weeks, however, there have been an increasing number of assaults, kidnappings and threats targeting activists by other groups.  On Saturday, armed men attacked unarmed protesters near the Sinak Bridge in Baghdad and shot 12, wounded about 100 and kidnapped many others. The attackers were believed to have included a mix of forces, including former militias that are now part of the Iraqi security forces, some of which are linked to Iran, and National Security forces, who are attached to the National Security Council. There have been no arrests announced in relation to that attack. A United Nations human rights report on the demonstrations released this week said that at least five high-profile demonstrators and activists have been kidnapped in recent days and held incommunicado by groups described as “militias.” There have been no arrests or people held to account in those incidents.  There has also been an uptick in attacks by the Islamic State, suggesting that the Sunni terrorist group may be taking advantage of the chaos to regroup.  The Islamic State targeted the militia affiliated with the nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr twice on Thursday night in Samarra, north of Baghdad. In one attack, a car bomber detonated his explosive, killing eight people, and in the second, a suicide bomber killed four people. Elsewhere in Salahuddin Province, a roadside bomb killed two police officers, and in neighboring Diyala Province a motorcycle rigged as a bomb killed one person. The security forces believe these two attacks were also the work of the Islamic State.']","Mistakenly believing that a 16-year-old had fired on them, a mob of antigovernment protesters stabbed him to death.

"On Your Tables: Ginger Beef, Caesars and Butter Tarts",2019-12-13,,"['By Ian Austen Readers of The Canada Letter were keen to highlight the contributions by their communities and provinces to Canadian cuisine after I presented my inadequate and incomplete list a couple of weeks ago. Among your many emails, one came from Jacqueline Fobes, a reader from Pebble Beach, Calf., alerting me to a terrific book about this very topic: “Speaking in Cod Tongues.” After giving it a read, I called Lenore Newman, its author and the Canada research chairwoman in food security and environment at the University of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. Professor Newman told me she was inspired to cross the country looking for sources of local food pride by a student “who became obsessed” with Nanaimo bars. She found some research money that, among other things, allowed the student to research whether the bars were actually from Nanaimo (they are). “That got me into the bigger story and of the role of women in the 1950s, their lives in mill towns and the cuisine they created,” Professor Newman told me. She defines Canadian cuisine in part by what it isn’t. “We don’t have a lot of recipes, and that’s a function of the nature of our cuisine,” she said. “It doesn’t mean it’s less developed. There’s lots of cuisines around the world that aren’t recipes. Instead, in Professor Newman’s view, Canadian cooking is “all about properties of seasonality, of incorporating wild foods, of multicultural incorporation and ingredients.” Several of you, too many to name, noted the absence of butter tarts from my list. That was a result of doubt and cowardice on my part. I planned to include butter tarts as one of Ontario’s contributions until I came across other provinces making claims on them. Professor Newman, however, assured me that they are indeed from Ontario.  If you didn’t catch it when it first appeared, be sure to read this defining take on butter tarts by Sara Bonisteel, my colleague in Cooking at The Times. [Read: The Passions of the Butter Tart] Marc LaPlante from Kingston, Ontario, and six other readers pointed out another missing item from Ontario. “Great Canucks, how can you not list the delight of the fried sweet BeaverTail  from the Ottawa Valley?” Mr. LaPlante wrote. Most commonly associated with skating on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, the BeaverTail is essentially flattened out doughnut pastry made with whole wheat flour and deep fried. The company that owns the name claims they were first sold by its founder, Grant Hooker, in Killaloe, Ontario, in 1978. Speaking for many parents, I’m sure, I have less than fond memories of trying to convince young children that not every skating excursion on the canal involved buying them. Ten readers brought up Calgary’s very important contribution: ginger beef. In her book, Professor Newman describes it as “deep fried strips of beef in a sweet sauce with fresh ginger, garlic, and hot pepper, usually with a few carrots and onions.” While it’s now a staple of most Chinese restaurants in Canada, Bill Corbett attributes its origins to the Silver Inn Restaurant.  He was also among several readers who raised Calgary’s creation of the Caesar. While that’s veering into beverage territory, it is an opportunity to bring up Robert Simonson’s article about how Canadians define the cocktail. [Read: It Came, It Quenched, It Conquered Canada: The Caesar] My mention of Vancouver and its Indian pizza prompted emails about two other variations on pizza. Cara Stewart reported that pirogi pizza can be found in Saskatchewan. I won’t render judgment until I’ve tried it next time I’m there. Bill Weaver pointed out that Hawaiian pizza — topped with ham and tinned pineapple — came out of Chatham, Ontario. “Although the topping creates some polarized views, I believe the addition of pineapple has advanced the taste of pizzas,” he wrote. Finally, several readers, including some of my friends, suggested that the peameal bacon sandwiches found at two stands in the St. Lawrence Market are the defining food of Toronto. But it seems a stretch to claim that they are to Toronto what bagels and smoked meat are to Montreal.  Professor Newman suggested it might be impossible to find a defining food for Toronto, a city of many foods. “I don’t think there’s ever going be a quintessential Toronto dish,” she told me, adding that the city is “just too global and multicultural.” \u200b\u200bYannick Nézet-Séguin, the musical director of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, told Dan Bilefsky that while growing up in Montreal, “I was abnormally intense.” Kawhi Leonard may now play for the Los Angeles Clippers, but the basketball crowd back in Toronto isn’t holding that against him. Sara Harowitz of Vancouver suggests five places to visit in the city’s Hastings-Sunrise district. Canada, the United States and Mexico agreed to a second version of the new NAFTA this week in a bid to get congressional approval in Washington. What benefits it will bring to autoworkers, however, is less clear. Boris Johnson won a resounding victory in Britain this week in an election that, like Canada’s, left the country divided politically along regional lines. The photographer Andrew Testa made a photographic portrait of the nation as it now faces Brexit. Like their Canadian counterparts, natural gas producers in the United States are hoping that exports of liquefied natural gas might reverse falling prices caused by a global glut of gas. Clifford Krauss’s reporting suggests that they both may be disappointed. Terry de Havilland, the British maker of psychedelic shoes for stars, has died at the age of 81. “I designed most of my shoes on acid, and the opening party for my shop in the King’s Road was famous for the three Cs — champagne, cocaine and caviar,” Mr. de Havilland once wrote. “God knows who was there — everybody.” Paintings on an Indonesian island that are at least 43,900 years old may be the oldest known art depicting scenes from the imagination.

Iran Says It Was Hit With ‘Very Big’ Cyberattack,2019-12-13,By Farnaz Fassihi and Ronen Bergman,"['Iran’s government has acknowledged that it faced a “very big” cyberattack, following a report in The New York Times this week that information from 15 million Iranian bank accounts was stolen and published online after widespread street protests were crushed in November. Iran’s telecommunication minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi — who had previously dismissed the bank-account theft as an insider extortion plot — said the attack had been state sponsored, but he offered no evidence to back up the claim. He said details and the country deemed responsible would be revealed after investigations had been completed.  Mr. Azari Jahromi said Iran’s cybersecurity unit had  thwarted the attack, making no direct mention of the compromised bank accounts. “We faced a very well-coordinated state-sponsored cyberattack on the government’s digital infrastructure,” Mr. Azari Jahromi told reporters in Tehran on Wednesday. “It was a very big attack.” He made the announcement the same day that Telegram, the popular phone app widely used in Iran, shut down the channel where the bank account details had been revealed for all to see.  The Telegram channel was created on Nov. 27 and until Dec. 5 had been home to the uploaded names and details for debit cards tied to the accounts of millions of Iranians who are clients of three banks — Mellat, Tejarat and Sarmayeh.  All three were the target of United States sanctions a year earlier over what American officials described as prohibited financial transfers done on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. “We routinely close down channels which publish personal data like passport scans or credit card numbers,” said Markus Ra, spokesman for Telegram. This channel was closed, he said, when a user reported it to the company after the publication of The Times article. A week earlier, Mr. Azari Jahromi had characterized the breaching of the bank accounts as the act of a disgruntled former contractor he said had obtained access to the information and was using it for extortion. As of Thursday, the banks had not issued a public statement about the breached accounts. But it appeared the problem continued even after the channel was erased from Telegram. Some Iranians posted screenshots of emails they had received from accounts with addresses identical to the customer service departments at two of the banks. The emails showed the account holders’ personal identification details and warned them: “We are in control of your bank information and your bank is lying to you.”  The emails advised these customers to take immediate action but did not specify what it should be. One Iranian said on Twitter that some of these emails contained an attachment file with the numbers of millions of leaked accounts. An Iranian cybersecurity expert based in New York, Amir Rashidi, said he had traced the emails to a server in Germany. Cybersecurity experts said that a breach of this magnitude could have been the work of a state actor, although there have been sophisticated attacks on Western banking systems that turned out to be organized by criminal groups.  They also said there was always the possibility that the attack had been the work of an insider.  Iranian media said the attack was the largest banking security breach in Iran’s history.  While there is constant cyberconflict between the United States and Iran, American financial institutions and the Federal Reserve have long been leery of offensive actions by the United States government against other countries’ financial systems. They fear that might legitimize reprisals against American accounts.  For Iran, the breach is the latest in a wave of challenges. In the past month, Iran announced it was facing a significant budget deficit because of American economic sanctions, it crushed nationwide demonstrations with a deadly response that has been widely criticized, and it contended with growing regional resentment. That is especially the case in Iraq, where Iran has exerted significant influence. Experts said that the bank breach, at the very least, could create a crisis of public trust with the country’s financial institutions. Boaz Dolev, chief executive of ClearSky, a cybersecurity company that was among the first outside Iran to spot the banking breach, said he believed the affected banks had deliberately kept quiet. Mr. Dolev speculated that the banks did not cancel the accounts “because they do not want to panic the public or they will find it very difficult to issue new cards.” In Israel — which, like the United States, has engaged in cyberconflict with Iran — news about the banking breach raised suspicions that Iran might blame Israel and take revenge. An Israeli banking official said two of the country’s biggest banks on Wednesday raised their cyberattack warnings to “top alert.”  A Middle Eastern intelligence official who tracks Iran and opposes its foreign policy said that over the past week top Iranian intelligence agencies, including the large cyberunit inside Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence, had been trying to track down the source of the banking breach and those behind the creation of the now-erased Telegram channel. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the security authorities in Iran were taking a serious stance on the breach and believe it had increased the potential for a renewed flare-up of antigovernment demonstrations, given the “damage to many citizens and the regime’s failure to prevent such information leaks.” David E. Sanger contributed reporting. ']",
Boris Johnson Tries On a New Campaign Persona: Disciplined,2019-12-11,By Mark Landler,"['UTTOXETER, England — On the second-to-last day of Britain’s landmark election campaign, Prime Minister Boris Johnson drove a backhoe through a wall of Styrofoam bricks. The wall was labeled “Gridlock,” while the backhoe was emblazoned with a Union Jack and the slogan “Get Brexit Done.” As political stunts go, it was hardly subtle. But it was a fitting end to a campaign that has had all the nuance of an earth mover. When Mr. Johnson faces British voters on Thursday, he is betting that his blunt-force message on Brexit will bulldoze three and a half years of political gridlock. The polls indicate he might be right: His Conservative Party has clung to a steady, if narrowing, lead over the Labour Party. If it holds, it would give Mr. Johnson the majority in Parliament he needs to take Britain out of the European Union. For the 55-year-old prime minister, whose brief tenure has been marked by legal setbacks, scorched-earth politics and unrelenting turmoil, it would be a striking political vindication, one that belies his clownish image and positions him to lead Britain through its most radical transition since the end of World War II. “This is a momentous occasion for our country,” Mr. Johnson told workers at a gleaming new factory built by JCB, a British construction-equipment maker in the Midlands, after he had climbed out of the backhoe. “I’ve never known a moment when the choice before us was so clear and so stark.” Yet the deep bitterness of the campaign attests to the divisiveness of Mr. Johnson’s binary message. It is less an appeal to an inspiring new vision of Britain than a grim promise to voters utterly fed up with talking about Brexit that he will get it done — once and for all, and regardless of what comes afterward. For all his talk of how consequential this election is, Mr. Johnson has either avoided talking about the far-reaching effects of leaving the European Union or has made far-fetched claims about Britain’s shimmering post-Brexit future. His party’s campaign manifesto is brief and vague, designed to avoid the traps that ensnared his predecessor, Theresa May. He waves away thorny questions like how he plans to negotiate a trade agreement with Europe in less than 12 months. “This is a transactional election,” said Andrew Gimson, who wrote an early biography of Mr. Johnson. “People are voting for Boris to get Brexit done, not because they love the Conservative Party.” There are few more transactional figures in British politics than Mr. Johnson. Largely devoid of big ideas or a coherent ideological framework, he has climbed the ranks by combining a quicksilver political expediency with a populist’s instinct for appealing to certain voters. In this campaign, he has repeated the phrase “Get Brexit done” so often that it has become a kind of incantation. Never mind that Brexit — should Mr. Johnson get it done by the end of next month, as he has pledged — would be just the start of the next phase in the country’s painful divorce from the European Union, which could take many more years. Mr. Johnson is famous for his shambling manner, a raffish untidiness that extends from his clothes to his personal life. It has been one of the ingredients of his political success, lending him an ordinary-guy appeal that would otherwise come hard to a Greek-poetry-quoting graduate of Eton and Oxford. In the campaign, however, Mr. Johnson has shown himself to be remarkably disciplined, sticking to his message, despite the best efforts of his opponents to shift the debate to other issues, like health care or crime. He seems less the happy warrior than a hyper-cautious tactician, one who started the campaign with a healthy lead and has been determined not to put it at risk. “In a sense, you’re getting the truer Boris Johnson, which is not the clownish, cuddly fellow,” said Sonia Purnell, another of Mr. Johnson’s biographers. “He is more ruthless than anyone you or I have ever met.” Mr. Gimson offered a more generous interpretation. “He’s quite an experienced campaigner,” he said. “Boris actually has thought through his campaign plan, and all the evidence on the ground is that it is working.” Mr. Johnson spent much of the campaign in the Midlands and the north, wooing working-class voters in corroded industrial towns who once voted so reliably for the Labour Party that the region was known as the party’s “red wall.” Many of them voted for Brexit in 2016 and blame the political establishment for thwarting their democratic will. He has hoisted a gutted cod in a fish market in the port town of Grimsby, weighed boxes of tea bags at a Tetley Tea factory in Eaglescliffe, in the northeast, and mopped a floor in the flood-damaged Derbyshire town of Matlock — drawing japes for his janitorial skills but grudging affection for the effort. “I like Boris,” said Malt Keeling, a butcher in Sutton-in-Ashfield, a Midlands town where the Conservative candidate for Parliament has a good chance of picking off a longtime Labour seat. “He’s not for the working man, I admit that,” said Mr. Keeling, who is 55. “But the Tories run the economy better.” Mark Heald, an unemployed Labour voter in nearby Kirkby-in-Ashfield, credited Mr. Johnson for putting Britain on the brink of leaving the European Union. “Everything he’s said he would do, he’s done it,” he said. But Mr. Heald, 44, said he was not ready to break with Labour. “This is the thing about this country: Who do you trust?” he said. “I don’t trust any of them. I’ve voted Labour all my life, so I’ll stick with them.” Trustworthiness has never been Mr. Johnson’s strong suit, and he did little to improve his reputation during this campaign. At the factory in Uttoxeter, he promised that Brexit would uncork a flood of pent-up investment in Britain (“We’ll start to get our mojo back, to be perfectly frank,” he said). What he failed to mention was that his own government had forecast that Brexit could reduce growth by as much as 6.4 percent of Britain’s gross domestic product by 2034. As he has throughout his career, Mr. Johnson still affects a carefree insouciance about the details. In Uttoxeter, he said he needed to wrap up his remarks because, “I now have to go,” pausing for several awkward seconds, as he looked around for a prompt from an aide, “somewhere else.” The audience tittered. Still, Mr. Johnson’s single-mindedness has unexpectedly made his campaign a somewhat joyless affair. There have been few moments of genuine spontaneity and more instances of protesters heckling. The most memorable image of Mr. Johnson’s campaign may prove to be his tense exchange with a local reporter who was trying to show him a photo of a child who had been forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital in Leeds because of a lack of beds. Rather than express sympathy for the child, a defensive Mr. Johnson grabbed the reporter’s phone and stuffed it in his pocket. Mr. Johnson’s aides have tried to soften his image. They released a commercial, inspired by a scene from the film, “Love Actually,” in which he turns up at a woman’s door and pleads wordlessly for her vote with flash cards (one of the film’s stars, Hugh Grant, has campaigned vigorously against him). But the prime minister, who made his name as a journalist, has methodically avoided scrutiny from the news media. He limits access to reporters who cover his campaign and ducked an interview with the BBC’s infamous interrogator, Andrew Neil. On Wednesday, when a reporter asked him to go on camera with the TV anchor Piers Morgan, Mr. Johnson escaped into a walk-in refrigerator. Such tactics outrage journalists in London. But it is not clear that they have hurt him with the working-class voters he is targeting. Despite Mr. Johnson’s messy personal life, allegations of misconduct while he was mayor of London and his disingenuous handling of Brexit, the news media have scarcely laid a hand on him. In this, he is similar to another populist politician with a checkered past who ran a convention-flouting campaign and won, said Baroness Rosalind Scott, a member of the House of Lords and a former president of the Liberal Democrats. “One of the things they learned from Donald Trump,” she said, “is that the rules are there to be broken.”']","The British prime minister is more grim tactician now than “the clownish, cuddly fellow” of the past. So far, it seems to be working."
"After North Korea Hints at New Policy, U.S. Warns Against More Missile Tests",2019-12-12,By Rick Gladstone,"['The United States is prepared to take “simultaneous steps” with North Korea to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula, the American ambassador to the United Nations said Wednesday, but she also warned the North Koreans against conducting further missile tests. The ambassador, Kelly Craft, made the remarks during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which was called at her request over worries that North Korea could soon resume testing of its long-range missiles or perhaps even nuclear weapons, which it halted in 2017. That moratorium was declared by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, during a period of optimistic-sounding diplomacy, punctuated by a summit meeting with President Trump in Singapore in June 2018, and two more meetings in following months. But talks between the two countries aimed at ending seven decades of hostility, and with it the elimination of Mr. Kim’s nuclear arsenal, have long been stalled. Mr. Kim, angered over United Nations sanctions that have isolated North Korea for years, has been hinting of a change in policy unless diplomatic progress is made with the United States. His military has launched more than a dozen short-range missiles this year, in what are widely viewed as signs of Mr. Kim’s impatience. Mr. Kim has given Mr. Trump a Dec. 31 deadline for a concession that could restart the diplomacy toward a peace agreement. Other North Korean officials have warned that the United States might receive an unwelcome “Christmas gift” if that deadline is ignored. Responding to the North Korean warnings, Ms. Craft sought to portray the United States as willing to make concessions, although she did not specify what they might be. “We have said many times before that we remain ready to engage in this comprehensive process,” Ms. Craft told the council. “We remain ready to take actions in parallel, and to simultaneously take concrete steps toward this agreement.” But she also warned against further missile tests, asserting they are not only violations of longstanding Security Council resolutions but are “deeply counterproductive to the shared objectives” of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. There was no immediate response from North Korea, which did not send any representatives to the Security Council meeting.  Hours later — Thursday in North Korea — its Foreign Ministry reacted with scorn and animosity. “The bandit-like U.S. which seeks to disarm us completely”  reaffirmed its “hostile” policy during the Security Council meeting by taking issue with North Korea’s efforts toward “modernizing its weaponry for self-defense” through tests, the ministry said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. “By holding the meeting, the U.S. did a foolish thing which will boomerang on it, and decisively helped us make a definite decision on what way to choose,”  the statement said. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly asserted he has a budding friendship with Mr. Kim, has largely ignored North Korea’s missile launches this year. The Trump administration also prevented a Security Council meeting requested by other members on North Korean human rights abuses, in what was interpreted as a gesture to mollify North Korea.

Mounting Evidence of Abuse by Chile’s Police Leads to Calls for Reform,2019-12-13,By Pascale Bonnefoy,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — The brutality of the Chilean police’s response to the country’s unrest  is leading to sweeping calls for the force’s reform. The protests, which started two months ago over an increase in subway fares and quickly morphed into a broader reckoning over inequality, included peaceful gatherings and violent confrontations with the police that resulted in thousands of instances of abuse, according to the National Institute for Human Rights, an autonomous state agency. Almost 400 of the incidents documented by the National Institute for Human Rights are of torture and cruel treatment. Another 194 involve sexual violence, including four rapes. More than 800 involve excessive use of force by the police. The Institute has labeled at least six killings by security forces as homicides. These documented instances of human rights violations have brought new scrutiny to the Carabineros, Chile’s national police force, which was never purged or significantly reformed after the dictatorship headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet ended in 1990. The Carabineros were deeply involved in human rights violations that left over 3,000 dead and disappeared and 38,000 tortured during Pinochet’s rule. “We never thought we would have to come back to Chile under these circumstances to record massive human rights violations,” said José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas’ director of Human Rights Watch, when the organization presented its report on Chile last month. “We thought this was history.” The Carabineros declined a request for an interview, but this week its director, Gen. Mario Rozas, said there were 856 internal investigations related to the reports underway. He also announced structural and policy changes to the institution.  President Sebastián Piñera said accusations will be investigated, and welcomed into the country four human rights organizations, including the Organization of American States and the United Nations, which found “a high number of serious human rights violations.” The government has also created a task force, led by Gonzalo Blumel, the interior minister, to propose reforms for the police force, and the police suspended the use of pellets. But human rights groups say that the Carabineros are still firing tear gas cartridges at demonstrators’ bodies and heads, in breach of their own protocol. On December 10, International Human Rights Day, 8 people were injured this way — two of them, including a 15-year-old girl, are in critical condition. Human rights groups and analysts say they want the government to increase its oversight of the Carabineros’s budget, operations and training and of their appointment and removal of officers, effectively bringing the police under civilian control.  Opposition legislators say the president bears responsibility for the actions of forces under his watch, and launched a process similar to impeachment proceedings against him and his former interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, who stepped down weeks after the protests began. The case against President Piñera was dismissed on Thursday. But on Wednesday, the Senate approved the accusations against Mr. Chadwick, holding him responsible for failing to take steps to avoid human rights violations and “not maintaining public order in a rational manner.” He was barred from holding any public office for five years. Since the protests began, hundreds of demonstrators have suffered eye injuries at the hands of the police, caused by the indiscriminate use of riot guns, often aimed directly at demonstrators’ heads. Two victims were blinded. More than 12,700 people have been wounded across the country, according to hospital records. The Public Prosecutor’s Office opened more than 2,670 criminal investigations based on reports of torture, sexual violence and injuries from firearms. The vast majority involve Carabineros personnel. When Chileans took to the streets in mid-October, the Carabineros were already facing a profound crisis, and were ill-prepared to be on the front lines of a sustained period of unrest. Over the past two years, more than 35 generals who were part of the Carabineros forces have been ousted in the wake of a series of scandals. Among those dismissed was the former police chief, who stepped down in 2018 after an anti-terrorist squad killed an indigenous man, Camilo Catrillanca, and then covered up the crime. Most of the senior officers removed were implicated in one of the biggest embezzlement scandals in Chilean history, a case that dragged on for more than a decade and involves at least $35 million. Nearly 100 police officers and civilians have been convicted to date in connection to the case, and the trial of 31 alleged ringleaders — a group that includes senior officers and former finance directors of the force — is scheduled to begin in a few months. The Carabineros’s intelligence division has also been in disarray after its agents came under investigation in connection with a scheme to fabricate evidence to falsely implicate members of the Mapuche indigenous community in terrorist activities in 2017. “All of this has generated significant internal conflict and discontent within their ranks, causing a legitimacy crisis that is both social and internal,” said political analyst Claudio Fuentes, a professor at Diego Portales University. Chile has seldom seen a period of unrest as prolonged and violent as the one that kicked off in mid-October. But signs of discontent had been brewing over the past decade: Large protests had taken place demanding education and pension reform, an end to corruption and respect for the land rights of indigenous people. And in every wave of protest, the police were accused of using disproportionate force — and of failing to credibly investigate and punish instances of abuses. Reforming the Carabineros was already on the legislative agenda when the protests broke out, but the proposed changes aim at improving transparency and fall short of the structural reforms needed to turn the police into a civilian force with robust accountability, which is what is being demanded now. Critics say the Carabineros have a hierarchical military structure and a system for disciplining officers that effectively discourage personnel from reporting misconduct or carrying out independent investigations. And the police often ignore the new use of force protocols they enacted in March, rights groups say. Bound by laws left behind by the Pinochet regime, Chile’s governments through the 1990s never had enough votes in Congress or the political sway to overhaul the Carabineros. Chilean authorities were unable to remove its high command, purge it of corrupt or abusive officers, or adapt its curriculum to a democratic scenario. “Carabineros is a militarized police force, with a military structure and logic, not a civil police force,” said Mr. Fuentes. “All attempts to reform it after dictatorship have been very slow, with very little capacity for civilian control.”']","Human rights monitors accuse the police of torture, sexual violence and other abuse, drawing scrutiny to Chile’s scandal-plagued national force."
"Arrest of Top Crime Fighter Stuns Mexico, Where Corruption Is All Too Routine",2019-12-12,By Kirk Semple and Paulina Villegas,"['MEXICO CITY — Even in a nation almost inured to corruption, the news was astonishing.  The man considered to be the brains behind the Mexican government’s militarized war on drug traffickers stood accused by American prosecutors of having been in the pocket of one of the major criminal groups he was ostensibly pursuing, severely undermining the very fight he was helping to lead. Genaro García Luna, Mexico’s former public security secretary, was charged with taking millions of dollars in bribes while in office to protect the Sinaloa Cartel, allowing the organization to smuggle tons of cocaine and other drugs into the United States. At the time, the group was led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, better known as El Chapo, who is now serving a life sentence in the United States.  The indictment, unsealed in New York on Tuesday, and the subsequent arrest of Mr. García Luna in Dallas hours later, stunned Mexico. It was as if Eliot Ness had actually been an accomplice of Al Capone. “It’s huge,” said Jaime López-Aranda, a security analyst in Mexico City who briefly worked under Mr. García Luna in the late-2000s. “I’m still a little bit in shock. And I keep thinking back to the guy and our conversations and his team and his people. It’s the sharp disappointment. I mean — my God, man. It’s like — ” He paused. “It’s like the end of an era.” Mr. García Luna was the chief engineer of the country’s controversial counternarcotics strategy that relied heavily on the armed forces to confront criminal groups and kill or capture their leaders. Mexico is still grappling with the legacy of his approach. While it had some success in capturing dozens of prominent crime bosses, deploying the military also spurred a sharp increase in violence and left a trail of death, as monolithic criminal enterprises were fragmented into an array of groups that have proven to be even more violent and uncontrollable.  For some Mexicans, the news of Mr. García Luna’s arrest was almost unimaginable. For others, it was proof of enduring suspicions that he had been in bed with criminals all along. Still others interpreted it as a sweeping — and scalding — referendum on the two administrations in which he served.  Then there were those who found confirmation that the whole apparatus of Mexico’s government was once and forever corrupt. Mr. García Luna was one of the architects — and the embodiment — of Mexico’s security strategy for a decade. From 2001 to 2005, during the administration of President Vicente Fox, Mr. García Luna led the Federal Investigative Agency, Mexico’s equivalent of the F.B.I. He then became the public safety secretary in the cabinet of President Felipe Calderón from 2006 to 2012, overseeing his boss’s “war” on drug trafficking organizations and the deployment of the Mexican military to wage it. Politically powerful, Mr. García Luna curried intense loyalty among his supporters but also inspired deep animosity among his critics, particularly when violence soared amid Mr. Calderón’s offensive against the traffickers. The strategy disrupted the criminal ecosystem but did not contain the violence between criminal groups, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and the disappearance of many others. The strategy continued under President Enrique Peña Nieto, but the current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has sought to discredit it, pointing to the fact that it failed to curb either drug trafficking or violence. At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. López Obrador said his government would not use the case of Mr. García Luna to beat up on Mr. Calderón, an outspoken critic of the current president. “I do not want you to think that we are taking advantage of this circumstance to attack former President Calderón, despite all the damage he did to us, not only to me, but to the country,” Mr. López Obrador said. But the president couldn’t seem to help himself, moments later describing the arrest as “a defeat to an authoritarian, corrupt regime, an element of proof that this model failed.” Anabel Hernández, a Mexican investigative journalist who has reported extensively on the alleged ties between Mr. García Luna and drug traffickers, found in his arrest some vindication of her work.  “There was not a war against drugs per se, but rather a war between cartels in which the federal government picked a side and protected the Sinaloa Cartel, which only meant more violence for society and more power to the cartel,” Ms. Hernández said in an interview. But for her, the indictment and arrest — in a foreign country — also reaffirmed her abiding frustration with the weaknesses of the Mexican state. “It reflects the immaturity of the Mexican political system, the lack of autonomy and inefficiency of the Mexican justice system,” she said. Some delighted in the news with a certain schadenfreude. In office, Mr. García Luna was hungry for media attention. Federal agents under his command once staged the arrest of a suspected kidnapper, and the liberation of three hostages, for broadcast on national television. He also enjoyed parading suspects before reporters and posing them with the piles of weapons and drugs impounded during their arrests. “For poetic justice, I would very much have liked a live television transmission of the detention of García Luna,” Leonardo Núñez González, a political analyst in Mexico City, wrote on Twitter. “But these things only happen in places like Mexico.” Many close associates of Mr. García Luna have largely kept quiet since the news of his indictment broke, as observers have speculated whether he has information that could lead to further indictments of former officials, not only in Mexico but also in the United States, which worked closely with Mr. García Luna during his years in government. Some observers were quick to point an accusatory finger at Mr. Calderón, saying that if his chief security minister had been working hand-in-hand with the Sinaloa Cartel, and getting huge payments for his efforts, then the president had to have known. “This indictment discredits the whole Calderón presidential term for a lot of people,” said Mr. López-Aranda, who served as Mr. García Luna’s spokesman at the Public Security Ministry for less than a year. For supporters of Mr. López Obrador, he added, “Christmas came early. Christmas for the next five years came early.” Mr. Calderón, who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the American indictment, said on Twitter: “My posture is always in favor of justice and the law.” But if the charges against Mr. García Luna were true, he wrote, it would be “a serious violation of the confidence entrusted in him.” Guillermo Valdés, who ran CISEN, a national security intelligence agency, during Mr. Calderón’s term, cautioned that even if Mr. García Luna were to be found guilty of the charges he faces, the entire government should not be implicated. “This would be a major blow to the Calderón administration, having a corrupt secretary of public security,” he said. But, he continued, “you simply cannot conclude that because of one corrupt government official, the rest of the government were obedient to the corrupt.” “It will be very sad to realize that you worked with a two-faced official,” he added. “And in that case we will have to admit that it was a monumental mistake to keep him.”']",The news shocked even a country grown used to graft: The man who for years led Mexico’s war against drug traffickers was accused of taking millions in bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel.
Photos of the U.K. in the Shadow of Brexit,2019-12-12,By Steven Erlanger and Andrew Testa,"['Britain is dragging itself through its fifth major election in five years: a third general election, even though Parliaments are supposed to last for five years; and two referendums, one on Scottish independence, which lost, and the other on Brexit, which won. The Leave victory in June 2016 has defined and marred British politics ever since, creating havoc within the traditional parties and bringing a nastiness and cruelty to public life that still seems very un-British, even to the British themselves. It has fed new divisions in the society and a harsh English nationalism that threatens the future of the kingdom, with both Scotland and Northern Ireland deeply troubled about leaving the European Union and doubtful about the bright radiant future the Brexiteers blithely prophesy.  What is most bizarre, perhaps, is that a majority of Britons now think it would be better to remain in the European Union. But most Britons, according to the same polls, also believe that the results of the Brexit referendum must be respected. Having spoken once, three and a half years ago, they want politicians to respect their vote, even if they now believe it was mistaken. So as they trudge to the polls once again, this time in winter, the British are exhausted. They have what many consider an unappetizing choice between Boris Johnson, an upper-class Conservative with a long reputation for mendacity, and Jeremy Corbyn, an aging socialist who is nearly as unpopular as Prince Andrew, whose youthful nickname of “Randy Andy” no longer seems so amusing. Britain feels anxious, traditional loyalties cracking, on the cusp of a transition to the unknown. Queen Elizabeth II soldiers on at 93 and her heir, Charles, the Prince of Wales, is just beginning to grow into the job for which he was born at an age, 71, when most people have retired. So the clever slogan of Mr. Johnson and his Brexit adviser, Dominic Cummings, fits the mood: “Get Brexit done.” Put an end to stalemate and squabble so many years after the referendum. Put lipstick on the pig that was his predecessor Theresa May’s deal with Brussels.  Of course, that will start another round of tedious negotiations on trade, but “Brexit” will be done, figuratively, anyway.  What happens then? Just now, few seem to care. Andrew Testa, who took these photographs on a long tour through Britain, summarizes the mood he found as precisely as his eye captured the country. “It’s all about the referendum,” he said. “People say, ‘We voted, so it has to happen, no matter the consequences.’”  Those who voted for Brexit had many reasons: British sovereignty, English nationalism, European bureaucracy, annoyance at German and French influence in Brussels, and the fear that too many foreign immigrants would dilute or alter national and regional identities built up over centuries.   The Somerset Carnival is one of the ancient traditions that some in England worry are being undermined by a changing demography, with large-scale immigration of workers from poorer parts of the European Union. The creation of significant Polish-speaking neighborhoods, with strains on local schools and health services, led to a big vote for Brexit in Lincolnshire. But the immigrants also created competition for work, and even in areas with few immigrants, British workers who have lost their industrial jobs often blame foreigners for their troubles. After Brexit, new immigration controls may sharply limit the number of people allowed to work and live in the country. That has some businesses, especially farms, coffee shops, hotels and restaurants, worrying about a labor shortage. Some who voted for Brexit have since had a change of heart, seeing some of the consequences, especially for trade with the Continent, Britain’s largest market. Many products will be subject to higher tariffs and shipping delays, and some European Union subsidies, especially for farming, will eventually disappear. John Gray, an organic farmer who took over from his parents, thinks that his daughter, Rebecca, now 14, might take over from him in time. But he worries about leaving the European single market and what that will mean for his beef and lamb.  Others in Northumberland, like shepherds, also regret their Brexit vote. Angry about the paperwork required for European subsidies, they now face the possibility of losing those subsidies altogether. And then there will be the paperwork for customs and health regulations if they want to continue to export their products. Ties to Europe inevitably damaged earlier ties to the post-colonial Commonwealth. Brexiters forecast new ties of trade with the former colonies, including the United States, that would make up for loss of European trade.  Some British people of Indian and Pakistani descent voted for Brexit to limit the number of Europeans who could come here to work and live, thinking that there would then be more room for immigrants from South Asia. One of the key sticking points to getting Brexit “done” has been the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. “No hard border on the island of Ireland” was one of the great accomplishments of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought a large measure of peace to the island.  It created a devolved government in Northern Ireland and led to the decommissioning of most arms by paramilitary groups on both sides — Republicans calling for reunification with the Republic of Ireland and loyalists fighting to remain in the United Kingdom. The pact opened the way to unification by consent, but more tangibly it removed the border posts between north and south, allowing freedom of movement and trade, akin to the fall of the Berlin Wall.  But now, Mr. Johnson’s Brexit plan threatens that peace by keeping Northern Ireland effectively in the European Union’s economic orbit, separating it from the rest of the United Kingdom — something that the unionists regard as a historic “betrayal.”  These photos show life along the border; no one wants to reconstruct that border, at least, with all the tensions and violence that might result. People here are weary of the games that have been played since the 2016 referendum and many are fed up with being at the mercy of distant politicians in Westminster, many of whom regard Northern Ireland as a backward nuisance.  The passions, anger and toxicity evoked by Brexit have been most visible in the regular demonstrations outside the Houses of Parliament, where the most vocal of both sides gather with their flags, loudspeakers and placards. This is where the television cameras show up, too. It is a form of democracy in the televisual age, but it hardly improves the quality of the debate.  The London bubble is also sacred, and can revolve too often around England, trade and the financial interests of the City of London. These things matter — the British economy is about 80 percent dependent on the service sector, not on industry or agriculture.  But the debate within the London bubble often misses the fatigue and anger of the kingdom’s three other nations — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Only Wales voted for Brexit. But Brexit has inspired independence movements of varying strengths in each of them. England makes up about 84 percent of the population of the United Kingdom, and has most of the wealth. So there is resentment from the other nations, who have their own histories and devolved assemblies, but who often feel patronized by England, by London and by the news media.  That feeling is especially strong in Scotland, with about 8 percent of the population, and which is governed by an openly separatist party, the Scottish National Party. Even in Wales, which has been much more closely tied to England and has only about 5 percent of the population, there are stirrings of independence. History matters. Every country lives by its tribes and its myths and its past glories. Britain is no different. One of the prime movers of Brexit has been Britain’s long sense of separateness from the Continent, cut off for centuries by the English Channel, only 21 miles across at its narrowest point.  The Channel Tunnel, after all, has only just celebrated its 25th anniversary. Britain’s Empire was also largely non-European, and Britain, of course, was on the winning side of World War II. Britons bravely fought off the Nazis and were never occupied, and hung on long enough for the United States to enter the war and for the Soviet Union to defeat Germany in the east.  The shore batteries and radar stations may be crumbling now along the British coastline, but the pride in that victory over German and Italian fascism, especially in the face of a conquered and occupied Continental Europe, remains a vital thread in the British identity.  The postwar French president, Charles de Gaulle, saw Britain as different, as a seafaring island nation, and vetoed its application for membership in what was then known as the European Economic Community, in both 1963 and 1967.  Britain finally joined on Jan. 1, 1973, after De Gaulle’s death. Now, 47 years later, it is preparing to leave. A new chapter opens in the island story.

"In Pakistan Hospital, It Was Lawyers vs. Doctors. 3 Patients Died.",2019-12-12,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Clad in black suits, white shirts and black ties, hundreds of lawyers forced their way into the Lahore cardiology hospital, smashing windows and damaging equipment. Doctors ran for cover, and unattended, panicked patients ran for their lives. The hospital wards were littered with shards of glass and broken furniture.  Riot police used tear gas canisters, water cannons and batons to disperse the intruders. The melee at the hospital, the Punjab Institute of Cardiology,  lasted for hours on Wednesday, shocking the country.  In the end, officials said, three patients died amid the chaos. And now at least 80 lawyers have been arrested by Pakistani authorities, while Prime Minister Imran Khan has ordered an investigation. The lawyers said they were avenging an attack in November by doctors and staff of the hospital, after the lawyers demanded preferential treatment.  Local news media reported that a lawyer visited the hospital, where his relative was being treated, in late November. He ended up arguing with the hospital staff and summoned some colleagues for support. The heated exchange turned violent, and the hospital staff and doctors injured three lawyers at the hospital building, the news reports said. Afterward, the lawyers tried to have terrorism charges filed against the doctors and have them arrested. The Lahore police tried to mediate between both groups, and no arrests have been made at the lawyers’ behest over that dispute. This week, lawyers carried out a strike and staged a protest demonstration against the police for failing to arrest the doctors involved in the November incident. On Wednesday, the lawyers said they decided to protest at the cardiology hospital after they felt provoked by the doctors. “In any society, no matter what the situation, such an attack on a hospital has never taken place,” said Muhammad Basharat Raja, the Punjab law minister. Paramilitary troops have been deployed at important government buildings in Lahore, the provincial capital, to quell further unrest. In recent years, lawyers in Pakistan have not shied from resorting to violence and taking the law into their hands. Lawyers have attacked judges over disagreements during court hearings. Clashes with police are frequent. Pakistani lawyers in general have been emboldened since 2007, when a political opposition protest campaign against the then-military dictator General Pervez Musharraf was spearheaded by lawyers.  Images of lawyers — dressed in their customary black coats and black ties — clashing with the police had assumed iconic status, as Mr. Musharraf struggled to maintain his grip on power and was eventually ousted. Some of the lawyers involved in Wednesday’s attack said they were moved to act by a viral video by one of the doctors, who mocked and ridiculed them through reciting poetry and belittling remarks. The lawyers live-streamed the run-up to their attack on the hospital as they walked toward the building. In one video, an unidentified lawyer is seen challenging the doctors, saying the doctors had invited their death and could not escape the wrath of the lawyers.  “Look at the sea of lawyers, doctor,” the lawyer said in a bombastic tone. “Today, we will insert stents in the doctors.”  Local news media reported that some lawyers carried weapons and fired in the air to spread panic. A police vehicle was set on fire during the violent standoff. The provincial information minister, Fayaz-ul-Hasan Chohan, was also beaten up by the lawyers as he tried to mediate between the lawyers and the doctors.  “The lawyers tried to abduct me,” Mr. Chohan said. A video of Mr. Chohan went viral on social media. Lawyers could be seen punching and pulling the minister’s hair as he and some journalists tried to extricate him from a group of lawyers. On Thursday, the Pakistan Bar Council said the lawyers would observe a countrywide strike on Dec. 13 against the “biased conduct of Lahore police.”  Dr. Yasmin Rashid, the provincial health minister, said the government would take stern action against the lawyers. Dr. Rashid said the lawyers exhibited an inhuman behavior and even manhandled a pregnant doctor during the ransacking of the hospital. “No one could imagine that such a day would come in Pakistan, when patients had to be provided security from the lawyers,” Dr. Rashid said.']","First the doctors attacked the lawyers.

"Battered U.K. Labour Party Ponders Next Move, as Corbyn Plans Exit",2019-12-13,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — It was supposed to be a new dawn, the moment when Jeremy Corbyn, Britain’s most left-wing political leader in a generation or more, proclaimed the start of the most ambitious economic transformation the nation had seen since the end of World War II.  Instead, a somber Mr. Corbyn was seen hugging his allies in the cafeteria of a sports and recreation facility in north London in the early hours of Friday, on his way to announce that his quest for power was over. Like other left-wing parties in Western Europe, Labour is once again in crisis, scrambling for answers to seismic shifts in electoral politics. Labour’s embrace of the leftist vision of Mr. Corbyn — once seen by many members as the party’s salvation — has led to electoral catastrophe. The question now is whether the party changes course and lurches to the center ground or elects a younger leader in Mr. Corbyn’s image, even after he was so thoroughly rejected by the voters on Thursday. Central to that conundrum is whether the voters rejected Mr. Corbyn himself, or his message. How is it that a man who was embraced as a beaming, grandfatherly character in the 2017 general election, making gains for Labour, would just two years later be saddled with some of the lowest approval ratings of any opposition leader in polling history? This time around he doubled down on his anti-austerity pitch of 2017, promising to shower money on social programs and the health service, while nationalizing many utilities and providing free broadband. But rather than exciting people, he seemed to lose them, many doubting his credibility.  His longstanding and, to many of supporters, unfathomable refusal to tackle forcefully anti-Semitism in the party or, in a  TV interview, to apologize, dogged his campaign and poisoned his image. He came to be seen as ineffectual, analysts said. That made him easy prey for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the nation’s predominantly right-wing press, all painting Mr. Corbyn as a dangerous radical who would lead the nation to economic ruin. And there was Brexit, the dominant issue but one that Mr. Corbyn, as a longtime euro-skeptic himself, never could quite come to grips with. Trying to appeal to both sides of his badly divided party, he managed to satisfy no one, by refusing to say which side he was on. To some voters it was perhaps the most critical blow to his credibility. “He failed to lead a proper campaign,” Sarah Rose, a 43-year-old sociologist, said of Mr. Corbyn as she walked her dogs in Clissold Park in the area Mr. Corbyn represents. “He failed to tackle accusations of anti-Semitism, and he failed to have a sensible position on Brexit. It’s devastating.” Speaking early Friday, Mr. Corbyn confirmed that he “will not lead the party in any future general election campaign.” His moment of political pathos unfolded, incongruously, on a stage alongside a novelty election candidate called Nick the Incredible Flying Brick, who wore a large yellow and black hat. What Mr. Corbyn said next — that he would stay on during a period of “reflection” — sets the scene for a ferocious battle over the succession and the soul of a party that was crushed by the Conservatives and has now lost four elections in succession. “This theme of having a period of reflection isn’t to allow people to reflect, it is the very opposite,” said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, describing the tactics of Mr. Corbyn’s close-knit allies. “They want a period of pause after the shock of this defeat to persuade members of their narrative that they need to keep on in the same direction,” he said.  Mr. Corbyn promised to stand aside “in the early part of next year sometime,” perhaps sensing that the party’s lawmakers might force a leadership election if he hangs around too long. Many critics, who were never reconciled to his leadership, feel vindicated. One of those, the veteran Labour lawmaker Margaret Hodge, reacted swiftly to Mr. Corbyn’s speech. “Corbyn talking about a period of ‘reflection,’” she wrote on Twitter, before adding tartly: “I’ve reflected. You failed. Please stand down.”   No successor will have as much baggage as Mr. Corbyn, but the fight to succeed him will be critical nonetheless.  Mr. Corbyn’s ally, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has ruled himself out as a contender, and unless he changes his mind, the “Corbynista” candidate is likely to be Rebecca Long-Bailey. A loyalist, she was raised in Manchester and worked in a pawnshop, call centers, a furniture factory and as a postal worker before eventually studying to become a solicitor. So bad was Labour’s defeat that another Corbyn ally and possible successor, Laura Pidcock, lost her seat in the electoral meltdown. But more centrist candidates will probably include Keir Starmer, who speaks for Labour on Brexit, and Emily Thornberry,  the party’s main speaker on foreign affairs. Ms. Thornberry, though once an ally of Mr. Corbyn, took a more anti-Brexit stance than he did, as did Mr. Starmer. Both were largely sidelined in the election campaign. Other contenders could be Angela Rayner and Jess Phillips. Labour Party members will ultimately choose the next leader, and many are loyal to Mr. Corbyn and his economic agenda, though a majority oppose Brexit. And in a survey among them earlier this year on potential successors, they rated Mr. Starmer as the top contender, with twice as much support as Ms. Long-Bailey. It is not surprising then, that Mr. Corbyn’s allies are already blaming Thursday’s defeat on Brexit, arguing that Labour lost in the north and the middle of the country because it was offering a second Brexit referendum under pressure from remainers, like Mr. Starmer. Ian Lavery, the party chairman, who wants to proceed with Brexit and is an ally of Mr. Corbyn, argued that the cause of the defeat was “not Jeremy Corbyn, it is Brexit and ignoring democracy.”  Yet there are deeper structural reasons for Labour’s loss of support in the parts of the north and middle of the country that defected to the Tories. “Brexit has accelerated a massive change in voting behavior, but not started it,” according to Peter Kellner, a political analyst and former president of YouGov, a polling organization. He noted that, until the mid-1980s, around 80 percent of Labour’s support came from manual workers and their families. With the decline of the big industries, coal mines, shipyards and steelworks, by 2010 white-collar Labour voters outnumbered blue-collar voters.  It will be up to the next leader to build a new coalition of support and decide whether to shift to the political center or try to keep alive Mr. Corbyn’s agenda, despite the crushing defeat. Mr. Fielding said that if the pro-Corbyn faction feels its grip on the party is weakening, things could get nasty. “They were able put to the people the most radical manifesto since World War II. It is their historic opportunity and they are not going to let it go,” he said.

2 Dead in Protests Over India’s Religion-Based Citizenship Bill,2019-12-12,By Suhasini Raj and Maria Abi-Habib,"['NEW DELHI — Tens of thousands of protesters rioted in three states across India’s northeast, some defying a government curfew and military deployment to demonstrate against the passage of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Bill, which will grant citizenship to thousands of migrants on religious grounds. By Thursday night, the government had shut down the internet, deployed hundreds of troops, imposed a curfew in Assam state and banned groups of more than four people from assembling in neighboring Meghalaya state.  The police shot and killed two protesters in Assam whom they accused of defying the curfew, and arrested dozens of others there, The Associated Press reported. Protesters are angry that the bill will grant citizenship to thousands of Hindu, Christian, Jain, Buddhist and Sikh migrants from some neighboring countries where New Delhi says they are religiously persecuted. Demonstrators say this will flood their hometowns with unwanted foreigners. The bill will make it harder for Muslim migrants to attain Indian citizenship, although many Muslims are also discriminated against in neighboring countries. Critics fear the bill will be used to harass Indian Muslims by forcing them to pass a citizenship test and prove their family’s lineage in the country, while giving a blanket pass to people of most other religions.  But government officials say the bill is a humanitarian effort to provide shelter to religiously persecuted minorities. The bill is expected to be signed into law in the coming days. The protests first broke out on Wednesday, after the controversial bill was passed by the upper house of India’s Parliament, and quickly turned violent. Protesters set two train stations on fire, clashed with security forces, blocked national highways, burned vehicles and attacked the home of the highest-ranking government official in Guwahati, the capital of Assam.   The government’s show of force only seemed to enrage protesters further, with larger numbers of demonstrators gathering on Thursday and clashing with security forces.   Protesters in the states of Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura say the bill will dilute their numbers by naturalizing Hindus from neighboring Bangladesh who fled to India decades ago, during their country’s civil war.  Although the three states are majority Hindu, their residents tend to be more concerned about safeguarding their unique ethnic makeup and linguistic heritage than about helping coreligionists from other countries. Hiren Gohain, a retired professor in Guwahati, denounced what he called an arbitrary bill by the government that had little public support, but only sought to reinforce the Indian government’s quest to unravel India’s secular underpinnings.    “There had been no demand from any quarter in India for this Citizenship Amendment Bill,” Mr. Gohain said in a telephone interview. India’s governing party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., “has brought the bill to polarize people among communal lines and extinguish the very national existence and culture of Assam,” he added. The government shutdown of the internet in Assam on Wednesday and Thursday secured India’s spot as the country with the most internet blackouts in the world. India, the world’s largest democracy, was responsible for 67 percent of the world’s internet shutdowns last year, with 134 incidents, according to Access Now, a digital information advocacy center.  So far this year, India has had 89 internet blackouts, some lasting months, as in Kashmir, where the internet was shut down for 133 days after the government stripped the majority Muslim territory of its autonomy in August. India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting directed TV channels on Wednesday to refrain from broadcasting protests or any “anti-national” content, a move critics say is part of government efforts to stamp out opposition. The order came as the live TV station for the upper house of Parliament cut out when opposition lawmakers heckled the home minister, Amit Shah, who is behind the Citizenship Amendment Bill. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government tried to push a similar citizenship bill. But the legislation stalled after many politicians objected to the religious dimension of the bill and the possibility that a large number of Hindu Bengalis would be made citizens, giving them the right to acquire land.']","Demonstrators defied troops and a curfew after the bill, which would make it easier for some non-Muslim migrants to become citizens, was approved in Parliament.

"After Volcano Eruption in New Zealand, 6 Bodies Are Retrieved in Risky Mission. 2 Are Still Missing.",2019-12-12,By Jamie Tarabay and Mihir Zaveri,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — A military team in New Zealand on Friday morning recovered the bodies of six people killed in a volcanic eruption on Monday on White Island but failed to find two others, undertaking a daring recovery mission even as the threat of another eruption loomed. The six bodies that were found were airlifted to a patrol vessel moored in the Bay of Plenty, the HMNZS Wellington, and were expected to be flown later to Auckland to be formally identified. The recovery team returned from the island, also known by its Maori name, Whakaari, without two other victims known to have been killed.  Col. Rian McKinstry, who was part of the command leading the Friday operation, said the team on the ground had to end its search because its air supplies were dwindling. But officials said the search would be continued from the air and the water, since one of the two victims whose bodies were not recovered was believed to have been swept into the bay. A dive team will be redeployed on Saturday to search for that body.   The retrieval mission, which began at daybreak on Friday, came after the New Zealand authorities had repeatedly delayed it out of concern for the safety of the recovery team. The volcano had been spewing steam, and conditions on the ground were still dangerous when the authorities decided late Thursday to move forward with the operation. The threat of volcanic hazards continued as the mission was underway on Friday, but Mike Clement, deputy police commissioner for national operations, told reporters that other conditions were “good in regard to the weather, sea state and the environment on the island.” He said that progress was “taking more time than expected” because the recovery team members’ heavy protective equipment was slowing their mobility. The rescuers were wearing protective gear to shield them from toxic volcanic gases, as well as from the ash underfoot. The eruption on Monday covered the popular tourist destination in the Bay of Plenty in ash while at least 50 people were visiting. The six bodies recovered on Friday were in addition to those of eight others that rescuers had transported off the island in the immediate aftermath of the eruption. Among those who were able to escape, at least 26 remained hospitalized on Thursday with burns over at least 30 percent of their bodies. On Thursday, Mr. Clement and Nico Fournier, a volcanologist, said conditions on White Island, also known by its Maori name of Whakaari, were too unstable and unpredictable for such a recovery operation, with a 40 to 60 percent chance of another eruption over the next 24 hours.  But the decision to move forward came as families expressed frustration at the delay in reaching the island. Two local helicopter pilots who landed on the island shortly after the eruption and rescued people from the shore have said conditions were ideal for an operation they said would not take more than 20 minutes to complete. “There is a growing sense of desperation to bring home those we love,” said Judy Turner, the mayor of Whakatane, a coastal community close to the volcanic island. “No news is not good for people in this situation.” There is also the chance that another eruption could further deteriorate the condition of the remains of the dead, hampering the ability to properly identify them. White Island is New Zealand’s most active volcano and for years has been a popular tourist destination. Tourists would don gas masks and hard hats to tour the apex of the volcano. Before this week, the deadliest episode there had been in 1914, when 10 miners were killed after part of a crater wall collapsed. The island, which is privately owned, became a scenic reserve in 1953, and more than 10,000 people visit each year. Since Monday, victims’ relatives and others have asked why tours had been allowed to continue despite warnings that volcanic activity had been on the rise.  Jamie Tarabay reported from Whakatane and Mihir Zaveri from New York. ']",The authorities had repeatedly delayed recovery operations because of challenging conditions on White Island.
Military’s Preferred Candidate Named Winner in Algeria Election,2019-12-13,By Adam Nossiter,"['Sizable street protests in Algiers and other cities greeted the announcement on Friday that a former Algerian prime minister, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, 74, had been elected the country’s new president in a much-contested vote the day before. Mr. Tebboune will succeed Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who ruled Algeria for 20 years before being chased out of power by popular protests in April.  The protesters, who largely boycotted the election, said it meant little. The country’s real rulers were still the military, they said, and in particular the army chief of staff, Gen. Ahmed Gaïd Salah. Mr. Tebboune was seen as the military establishment’s preferred candidate. Demonstrators coursed through the streets of Algiers on Friday chanting, “We didn’t vote,” over and over. The official turnout in Thursday’s vote was a record low of around 40 percent. The actual turnout was likely far less as the vote was extremely low in the country’s major cities, including Algiers. One Paris-based Algerian analyst, Moussaab Hammoudi of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, citing a contact in the upper ranks of the country’s bureaucracy, said the turnout was actually a fraction of the official number. In Algiers, Abdoulmoumene Khelil, secretary general of the Algerian Human Rights League, agreed. “It’s clear that the officially announced turnout is completely false,” he said. “We saw that nobody came out to vote. We’re used to these completely falsified elections. That’s why we didn’t put forward a candidate.” Protesters rallied in Algiers against the election even as it was being held, staving off aggressive police intervention to do so. Mr. Tebboune had faithfully served Mr. Bouteflika for years: as a local official, as a powerful minister, and then briefly in 2017 as prime minister, before being thrown out of office by Mr. Bouteflika’s brother Saïd, who by then had become the country’s real ruler because of his older sibling’s illness. But analysts said that one reason Mr. Tebboune was the preferred candidate of the military establishment, and of General Gaïd Salah, was because he appeared to have split with the Bouteflika clan, with which the general was in bitter conflict by the end of his tenure. The protesters had long since rejected Mr. Tebboune, as well as the other four candidates in the race, as part of the “system,” their epithet for the ruling elite that has governed the country since independence from France in 1962. The generals who historians and analysts say are the real power-brokers in the country had insisted on holding Thursday’s vote in an effort to move the country past the protest movement. “These were elections ordered by the military command,” Mr. Hammoudi said. “They needed to have these elections, to give themselves a civilian facade. But what Gaïd Salah thought would be a solution, actually only deepens the problem for them.” Mr. Khelil, the rights activist, said that the election “contradicts the will of the people” and was intended to give the existing system a “civil facade.” “It brings nothing concrete to what the people’s movement wants,” he said, speaking from the middle of the big demonstration in Algiers on Friday. “Maybe it resolves an internal problem in ‘the system,’ but it doesn’t resolve the demands of the Algerian people.” On social media, protesters said the protest movement would continue, as it did Friday. Mr. Khelil said either the new president would work to meet the demands of the protesters, beginning with the release of dozens who have been imprisoned in recent months — he thought this unlikely — or the government would double down on repressing the movement, “which would be a fundamental error.” Abdelkrim Boudra, one of Friday’s marchers and a member of an opposition study group, said “the political crisis is only going to get worse.” “They’ve reached the logical end, and they will soon realize that they haven’t resolved anything,” he said, speaking of the authorities. “Yesterday we saw the police unleashed. I hope it stops right there.” Mr. Hammoudi said: “People have only one obsession: to get rid of the regime. This masquerade won’t pacify the movement.” Hadjer Guenanfa contributed reporting from Algiers.']","Antigovernment protesters took to the streets to reject the vote as illegitimate.

6 Bodies Retrieved Near New Zealand Volcano. Ground Search Halted for 2 More.,2019-12-12,By Jamie Tarabay,"['Eight members of New Zealand’s military flew on Friday to White Island, a popular tourist destination, where they recovered the bodies of six victims killed in Monday’s eruption of the island’s volcano. But the team ended its ground search for two other bodies in the afternoon. Col. Rian McKinstry, who was part of the command leading the Friday operation, said the team on the ground had to end its search because their air supplies were dwindling. But officials said the search would be continued from the air and the water, since one of the two victims whose bodies were not recovered was believed to have been swept into the bay. A dive team will be redeployed on Saturday to search for that body. The recovery team had gone to the island, also known by its Maori name, Whakaari, at daybreak Friday and spent four hours on the ground searching for the bodies. John Tims, the deputy police commissioner for national operations, said the six bodies that were recovered were airlifted by helicopter back to the recovery team’s vessel, the HMNZS Wellington, moored in the Bay of Plenty, before being flown later to Auckland to be formally identified. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she hoped the recovery of the bodies would bring some closure.  “Today was all about returning them to their loved ones,” Ms. Ardern told reporters  in Whakatane, a nearby mainland coastal town. “We know that reunion won’t ease that sense of loss, of suffering, because I don’t think anything can, but we felt an enormous sense of duty as New Zealanders to bring their loved ones home,” she said. Deputy Commissioner Wally Haumaha reported that relatives of the dead reacted with relief when they heard the bodies had been secured.  “Like any family would welcome home a loved one, these people have been waiting patiently and just to hear the process was going well, they were ecstatic,” he told reporters.  At least eight additional people were killed in the eruption, with the total death toll from the disaster believed to be at least 16. Of those who were able to escape the island, at least 26 remained hospitalized on Thursday with burns over at least 30 percent of their bodies.  The operation to retrieve the remaining victims had been delayed for days because of the volatility of the volcano, which could erupt again at any minute.  “The combined interpretation of all our data is that magma is degassing at shallow depths and the situation remains highly volatile,” said Craig Miller, a volcanologist with GeoNet, the agency that monitors geological activity in New Zealand. Mike Clement, also a deputy police commissioner for national operations, told reporters earlier Friday as the operation was underway that progress was “taking more time than expected” because of the recovery team’s heavy protective equipment, which was slowing their mobility.  The risk of another eruption during the recovery effort was significant, and that was the biggest reason the operation had been delayed since Monday. Volcanologists working with the police and rescue operations have said all week that the possibility of White Island erupting again was about 40 percent to 60 percent. On Thursday, Nico Fournier, a volcanologist in New Zealand, told reporters that White Island hadn’t been this volatile since 2016. The rescuers wore  protective gear to shield them from toxic volcanic gases, as well as the ash underfoot. Mr. Fournier said anyone traversing the island would have difficulty breathing, seeing and walking. On normal tour days, visitors are given hard hats and gas masks when they journey to the island. Health officials found themselves suddenly desperate for one item in particular to help the victims: skin grafts. Peter Watson, the chief medical officer for the district health service in Auckland, told reporters that while New Zealand has a stock of skin, it urgently needs more — about 1.2 million square centimeters — roughly 1,292 square feet.  “The supplies are coming from the United States and the order has been placed,” he said.  Doctors said some of the injured have burns over 90 percent to 95 percent of their bodies. The patients have been sent to burn units in other hospitals around the New Zealand, and several Australian victims have been evacuated to hospitals in Sydney and Melbourne.  A patient with 40 percent burns would require at least eight hours of surgery. As a consequence, all those burn units have been operating, sometimes three to four procedures at a time, since the Monday disaster.  “Monday is beyond anything we would have anticipated,” said Dr. Heike Hundemer, clinical leader of Whakatane Hospital. “We used every single bed space, every resource we had to care for those people.” And many on the hospital’s staff were working to save people they knew, she said. “Our staff are deeply impacted by what we saw. We are a tight team, in a small community. Some of those people who have lost their lives were known to our staff.” White Island is an enormous tourist draw in New Zealand, having appeared in “Lord of the Rings” and other films, and its volcano is the country’s most active.  Still, how such a calamity was allowed to happen is the biggest question everyone has been asking. The volcano had been exhibiting high levels of activity in recent weeks.  Police and workplace safety officials have started investigations into the deaths of the tourists and into at least two employees from a tour operating agency that brought visitors to the island. Questions have persisted over what people knew and when, but Geoff Hopkins, a 50-year-old pastor who was on the island 30 minutes before the volcano erupted, said everyone was well aware of the risks they were taking by walking onto an active volcano.  GeoNet, the geological monitoring agency, had reported increased activity at the volcano for several weeks before the eruption, raising the warning level to 2 out of 5, but maintaining that the island was still safe for visitors. The tours have been running for decades, under a deal between a handful of operators and the family that has passed down ownership of the land through several generations.  The tours fall under the jurisdiction of the 2016 Health and Safety at Work (Adventure Activities) Regulations, which require a safety audit for companies that “deliberately expose the participant to a serious risk to his or her health and safety that must be managed by the provider of the activity.”  White Island Tours, which was responsible for bringing most or all of the people to the island on Monday, is a registered and approved tour provider. A little over a year ago, it won an award as one of the safest places in New Zealand to work. ']",
"Jeremy Corbyn, U.K. Labour Leader, Struggles to Close Election Gap",2019-12-11,By Stephen Castle,"['BIRMINGHAM, England — The chants are the same as in 2017: “Oh JER-e-my COR-byn, Oh JER-e-my COR-byn.” The message, taking on “the rich and powerful” and ending austerity with a burst of nationalizations and public spending, is largely the same, too. Yet, two years later, the magic that seemed to envelop the opposition Labour leader’s campaign in 2017 and deprived the Tories of their parliamentary majority seems to be lacking. With Labour mired in a continuing crisis over anti-Semitism, opinion polls suggest that Mr. Corbyn is struggling even to repeat his surprisingly strong 2017 performance, let alone score an outright victory for his brand of socialism in the general election on Thursday. But little of that pessimism was on display at a recent rally in Birmingham, England, where an eclectic blend of poetry, music and political speeches was met with deafening cheers. A celebrity guest, a Birmingham-born singer, Jamelia, told the crowd that she had never voted before but will do so, at age 38, for Mr. Corbyn. “We all know the story,” she later added, “of David and Goliath.”  David, in this case, is Mr. Corbyn, a 70-year-old veteran activist who spent three decades on the fringes of politics, yet could become Britain’s most left-wing prime minister in living memory, albeit probably only at the head of a minority government.  That outcome in itself would be momentous, with big implications for the country’s future and, of course, Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to pile up a clear parliamentary majority if he is to take Britain out of the European Union next month, as he has promised. In the final stretch of the campaign, the Labour Party has shifted to a more defensive posture. That has meant pouring precious resources into traditional strongholds in the north and middle of the country — places that voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum — rather than trying to win Conservative districts in the south that voted to remain.  The hope is that Labour can lure undecided Britons and squeeze the vote of the centrist Liberal Democrats, whose campaign seems to have faltered. As Election Day approached, many opinion polls tightened, jangling nerves among Mr. Johnson’s team. Still, many Labour supporters had expected more, considering that nine years of Conservative rule have produced tough and unpopular austerity policies and more than three years of political chaos over Brexit. “There is now some panic about whether Labour can hold some of their existing seats,” said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. “It has now become a defensive campaign, and from the perspective of what we had been led to believe, that is a clear defeat.” Mr. Corbyn’s leadership has been marred by factionalism and by persistent claims that he has tolerated anti-Semitism within Labour’s ranks. The critics include the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, the spiritual leader of much of Britain’s Orthodox Jewish community, who argued that “a new poison — sanctioned from the very top — has taken root.”  Leaks of a submission from the Jewish Labour Movement to Britain’s Equality and Human Rights Commission included 70 sworn testimonies from current and former Labour staffers, and concludes that “the Labour party is no longer a safe space for Jewish people,” The Guardian reported. Frustratingly for many Labour supporters, Mr. Corbyn has resisted making flat-out apologies, refusing four opportunities in one TV interview before doing so, somewhat reluctantly, in a second. Coming from the far left, Mr. Corbyn has always faced hostility from Britain’s news media, which is dominated by right-wing tabloids. That, in part, is why Mr. Corbyn was written off by many in the 2017 campaign before confounding his critics. But that was then. In 2017 Mr. Corbyn was less well-known and benefited from the greater exposure broadcasters had to give him during an election under British law. Many voters were pleasantly surprised to see a personable, grandfatherly figure, a man who toils on his garden allotment, makes his own jam, rides a bicycle and was a multiple winner of Parliament’s beard of the year competition. His unashamedly socialist message struck a chord with many young people, and when he spoke after the 2017 election at the Glastonbury rock festival, the crowd chanted his name to the opening riff from the White Stripes song “Seven Nation Army.” But that enthusiasm seems to have waned during two years of wearisome and fruitless haggling in Parliament over Brexit. After a huge surge, the number of Labour Party members has dipped, and persuading activists to campaign has been tough in a winter election that few wanted. Back in 2017, success came partly from avoiding the bitterly divisive issue of Brexit and focusing instead on ending austerity and concentrating on core issues like health care. But with the Brexit saga reaching a critical point, Mr. Corbyn has struggled to shift the argument, at least until the last days of the campaign, when the fate of the National Health Service leapt into the headlines. Mr. Johnson has a snappy, if misleading, slogan — that he will “get Brexit done,” even though most analysts think it will take years to hammer out a new trade agreement with the European Union, not to speak of the United States. But Mr. Corbyn has been slow to call Mr. Johnson out, partly because Labour’s fuzzier Brexit policy was constructed to straddle internal divisions. Labour wants to negotiate a new exit deal with the European Union and put that to a referendum, with remain as the alternative and Mr. Corbyn staying neutral. At a news conference in London where Mr. Corbyn accused the Conservatives of misleading voters about their Brexit deal, a reporter asked him how he could make that claim when he himself refuses to say whether he would vote for or against Brexit in a second referendum. In contrast to their austere 2017 agenda, the Conservatives now promise more public spending, encouraging Labour to double down on its austerity-ending platform of 2017. That has opened Mr. Corbyn to accusations of irresponsible spending.  Professor Fielding thinks Labour did not expect the Tories to learn from their experience in 2017, and adds that Mr. Johnson, despite his flaws, is “not as bad as Theresa May; he’s a better candidate and armed with his clear ‘get Brexit done’ campaign motif.” “Jeremy Corbyn is no longer the new face on the block, that’s been and gone and you don’t come back from appalling approval ratings twice,” Professor Fielding said.  Laura Parker, the head of Momentum, a leftist group that supports Mr. Corbyn, counters that her 40,000 members have been more active than in 2017, that their videos have been viewed 65 million times and that anything is possible even if voters seem weary about politics. “There could be as many as six million people who have not yet decided how to vote,” she said. At the rally in Birmingham — an attempt to recreate the energy of the 2017 campaign — Mr. Corbyn talked without notes, preaching to the choir in a stump speech about soaking the rich and showering benefits on the less fortunate that he has been making for decades. Activists like Derick Johnson, an information technology expert, are delighted to hear a socialist, rather than a centrist, message from a Labour leader. “Everybody who listens to him likes him,” he said of Mr. Corbyn. If that is true, a lot of people are not listening. At the nearby bus station was Debbie Sexton, who once voted Labour but has switched to the Conservatives because of Brexit and Labour’s economic policy. “Where is all the money coming from?” she asked. The morning after his Birmingham rally, Mr. Corbyn was asked whether Labour might do better under someone else’s leadership. “I think Marmite is really good for you,” he replied, comparing himself to a salty British spread that divides opinion almost as much as Brexit itself. “Some people like it, some people don’t.” ']","The national polls put the Conservatives ahead, just as they did in 2017 when the left-wing Mr. Corbyn shocked the experts. But can he recapture that magic? "
"Unrest Marks Algerian Election, as Protesters Boycott the Vote",2019-12-12,By Adam Nossiter,"['Crowds in Algeria sacked voting stations on Thursday and the police used force to break up demonstrations, as the authorities went ahead with a presidential vote in the face of a popular boycott by a movement that toppled a president early this year. The police beat back protesters with truncheons, but large crowds protesting the election continued to assemble in central Algiers. A polling station in the city center was stormed, forcing a temporary suspension of the vote, and unrest was reported around polling stations in the mountainous Kabylie region, traditionally hostile to the authorities. The vote is the first since a popular uprising — mass protests denouncing pervasive corruption — chased out Algeria’s long-ruling president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April. An “interim government” of his former allies was quickly installed, backed by the army. Since then the protesters, who for months have assembled peacefully every week in the streets of Algiers and other cities, have demanded a complete overhaul of what they call “the system” — an end to the careers of all those associated with Mr. Bouteflika, who ruled Algeria for 20 years. Instead, the aging generals who have been the country’s ultimate arbiters for generations, insisted on holding an election that was broadly rejected from the start by much of the population. The strange campaign that followed — empty meeting halls, tight security for candidates, posters torn down everywhere — spoke to what was likely to be a low turnout. The five candidates competing in Thursday’s vote all worked for Mr. Bouteflika, and two served as his prime minister. That, say the protesters, is the problem: the generals are simply trying to recycle the Bouteflika regime, giving it an electoral facade. Mr. Bouteflika himself used the tactic for years, staging elections whose legitimacy was widely questioned. “Algerians don’t agree with this type of election,” said Nacer Djabi, a widely respected sociologist, in an interview on Thursday in Algiers. “Obviously they are not against elections. But they are against the conditions in which this election is unfolding, and they are afraid that these elections will simply reproduce the same system, the same faces, the same policies, the same corruption.” Calls for an election boycott have been sounded ever since the vote was announced in September, and observers noted sparse participation at many, though not all, polling stations on Thursday. Turnout in Algeria’s vast desert hinterlands appeared to be higher than in the cities. “This election has been imposed, and given what’s been seen every week, it seems clear that the vast majority of citizens won’t go to the polls,” the independent newspaper El Watan wrote in an editorial on Thursday. Results are not expected until Friday. In Algiers, the police were out in force, with police vans and anti-riot trucks lining the streets. They moved quickly Thursday to break up an anti-election demonstration in the center of Algiers, beating protesters and arresting about a dozen. French television showed officers in riot gear rounding on a protester, kicking and beating him. On Wednesday night, the police had sealed off the capital’s main boulevards, hoping to prevent crowds from gathering. The tactic did not work, however, as a considerable number of protesters had assembled in front of the central post office, for months the main gathering spot, by Thursday afternoon. The two leading contenders in the vote on Thursday are thought to be former prime ministers Ali Benflis, 75, whose recent pre-election rally had to be protected from protesters by the police with tear gas and water cannons, and Abdelmadjid Tebboune, 74. Both the candidates and the army general who exercises real power in Algeria, Chief of Staff Ahmed Gaid Salah, 79, have tried to win over the demonstrators. Unpopular figures associated with the old order have been sentenced to jail, including Mr. Bouteflika’s brother, Said, and a host of leading businessmen accused of corrupt complicity with the government. And the candidates, at their near-empty meetings, have insisted that they sympathize with the goals of the protest movement. They have been heckled and jeered nonetheless. The protest movement has rejected the candidates’ overtures. Mistrust is total. Lately, the government has lashed out against the protesters. “There’s a neocolonialist school of thinking which makes use of some Algerians, or rather pseudo-Algerians — traitors, mercenaries, homosexuals,” said the interior minister, Salah Eddine Dahmoune. “We know who they are.” General Salah, himself, has issued veiled warnings. The election is taking place amid an economic crisis, and whoever wins will immediately face budgetary and unemployment problems. But the new president will be widely seen as lacking the legitimacy to tackle those challenges. Algeria, Africa’s third-biggest oil producer, depends on oil and gas for 95 percent of its exports. But the price of oil is about half of what it needs for the government to balance its budget. The arrest and jailing of leading businessmen has meant frozen payrolls and layoffs. Analysts estimate that 60 percent of businesses have stopped their activities. “We’re going to have a president who will not have legitimacy at the national level, and who can’t be legitimate internationally,” said Mr. Djabi, the sociologist. “This president will be weak in the sense that he won’t be able to solve economic and social problems. A president who is badly elected can’t solve the Algerians’ problems.” Hadjer Guenanfa contributed reporting from Algiers.']",The protesters who toppled the longtime president say the vote is window dressing for the corrupt officials who still control the country.
9-Year-Old Prodigy Pulled From College Over Degree Delay,2019-12-11,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Until this week, Laurent Simons was on track to become the world’s youngest university graduate.  The 9-year-old Belgian prodigy was working on a brain-connected electrical chip for his final project at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, with the hope that he would complete his coursework and receive a diploma before he turned 10 on Dec. 26. It would have been a perfect Christmas gift, said his father, Alexander Simons, capping off a frenetic few years in which Laurent started primary school at age 4, went to high school at 6 and entered the university in Eindhoven at 9. But the plan went awry on Monday, when Laurent’s parents terminated his studies at the university over a dispute about the boy’s possible graduation date.  The university said in a statement that Mr. Simons had “repeated his explicit wish that his son should obtain his bachelor’s degree at the age of 9,” which the university considered not feasible given the exams he still needed to pass.  Mr. Simons rejected an offer in which Laurent would have graduated next year without a specific deadline, arguing that such a delay was unacceptable. The university had used his son “like a Christmas tree,” he said, a glittering ornament that made the institution shine. “He wasn’t making it,” the university spokesman, Ivo Jongsma, said about Laurent’s previous graduation plans. “But of course it wasn’t a problem for us,” he added. “He’s a genius; he would still have been one of the fastest ever” to graduate from a university. Laurent made international headlines last month when his parents publicized the news that he would graduate with a degree in electrical engineering by the end of the year. He had enrolled at the Eindhoven university in March, and his mentor there, Prof. Peter Baltus, said that Laurent was on track to finish a three-year program in just 10 months. “His absorption capacity is very high,” Professor Baltus said. In a phone interview last month, Laurent said he wanted to study medicine, get his doctorate and make artificial organs. He said he wanted to help people like his grandparents, whom he grew up with in the Netherlands while his parents worked in Belgium, and suffered from heart problems.  As Laurent’s potential graduation date came closer, his parents made him available for interviews and posted pictures on an Instagram account that gained tens of thousands of followers in a few weeks. “Busy Week With Interviews!! Building Up The Pressure! Soon Gigantic News!!,” a post read. But the university told Laurent’s parents that their son would need more time to complete his studies. On Friday, Mr. Simons organized a news conference in which he accused the Dutch institution of trying to delay Laurent’s plans to study for a Ph.D. at a “high-end” university in the United States.  “It’s like a bright soccer star who plays for P.S.V. Eindhoven,” Mr. Simons said, referring to the prominent Dutch soccer team, “and you get approached by Paris Saint-Germain,” he added about the top French club that has paid hundreds of millions to acquire a roster of stars in recent years. “You’re not going to say no.” It was unclear how Mr. Simons planned to have his son study for a doctorate without an undergraduate or even a master’s degree. He described Laurent as disappointed that he would not graduate this year. “Imagine how he feels,” he said. In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Simons also said that the Eindhoven university had done his son a disservice by moving back his graduation date, and having master’s students rather than full professors teach him recently.

"Indian Parliament Passes Divisive Citizenship Bill, Moving It Closer to Law",2019-12-11,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj,"['NEW DELHI — The upper house of the Indian Parliament passed a contentious citizenship bill on Wednesday, bringing a religiously polarizing measure one step closer to law as new protests erupted across the country.The measure, called the Citizenship Amendment Bill, uses religion as a criterion for determining whether illegal migrants in India can be fast-tracked for citizenship. The bill favors members of all South Asia’s major religions except Islam, and leaders of India’s 200-million-strong Muslim community have called it blatant discrimination. The Rajya Sabha, India’s version of a senate, approved the bill in a 125-to-105 vote. It next goes to the president’s desk, where it is expected to be signed into law in the coming days. Opponents of the legislation in India and international rights groups have called the bill a major blow to India’s long-held commitment to a secular democracy. Officials in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government have insisted that the legislation would protect human rights. [Update: Modi urges calm as New Delhi violence rages for third day.] “The bill provides expedited consideration for Indian citizenship to persecuted religious minorities already in India from certain contiguous countries,” said Raveesh Kumar, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. “It seeks to address their current difficulties and meet their basic human rights. Such an initiative should be welcomed, not criticized by those who are genuinely committed to religious freedom.”  The bill is a central piece of a far-reaching agenda by Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, which has long espoused a Hindu-centric worldview.  India is around 80 percent Hindu, with a large Muslim minority, and many of Mr. Modi’s supporters believe India should emphasize its Hindu identity as much as possible and become more of an overtly Hindu nation. India’s founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, resisted this, insisting on keeping India a secular state and carving out special protections for minorities, including Muslims.  Mr. Modi is popular and powerful, and his political party is one of the most dominant forces that India has produced in decades. Still, it has plenty of detractors, and protests over the bill have grown bigger and more violent throughout the week.  Late Wednesday, the Indian government shut down the internet in many districts in the state of Assam and called up the army in other areas to quell the chaos. The police were already battling demonstrators with water cannons and tear gas.  Protests have broken out in Aligarh, Bhopal, Deoband, Jaipur and several cities in the northeast, where the bill could have the largest effect by allowing Hindu migrants to settle legally in areas where locals have expressed anti-migrant sentiments.  The Indian government has promised to protect indigenous rights in these areas, but that has failed to quash suspicions or resentments. More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the heart of Assam’s commercial capital, Guwahati, yelling: “Go Back Modi!” In other places, angry men set fire to tires and stomped on effigies of Mr. Modi.  As the protests spread, many people debated what kind of country India should be. “The idea of India that emerged from the independence movement,” said a letter signed by more than 1,000 Indian intellectuals, “is that of a country that aspires to treat people of all faiths equally.” But this bill, the intellectuals said, is “a radical break with this history” and will “greatly strain the pluralistic fabric of the country."" The citizenship legislation, which passed through the lower house of Parliament on Monday, follows hand in hand with a divisive citizenship test conducted this summer in one of India’s states and possibly soon to be expanded nationwide.  All residents of the state of Assam, along the Bangladesh border, had to produce documentary proof that they or their ancestors had lived in India since 1971. Around two million of Assam’s population of 33 million — a mix of Hindus and Muslims — failed to pass the test, and these people now risk being rendered stateless. Huge new prisons are being built to incarcerate anyone determined to be an illegal immigrant.  Some of those who have been arrested have lived in India for generations.  The citizenship bill would allow Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsees or Jains who have migrated from Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan a clear path to naturalization in India.  Migrants who are Muslim — which might include people who have lived in India for generations but were unable to produce an old property deed or birth certificate to prove it — would not be afforded the same protection.  The bill excludes Muslim members of religious minorities from neighboring countries, such as the Rohingya who have been persecuted ruthlessly in neighboring Myanmar.  International organizations have seized on that in criticizing the legislation. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal body, called the measure a “dangerous turn in the wrong direction” and said that the United States should consider sanctions against India if the bill passes. Indian officials and other supporters of the bill cite attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all of which are predominantly Muslim, and the shrinking Hindu populations in those countries. Kanwal Sibal, a former foreign secretary and a supporter of Mr. Modi’s foreign policy, said the bill “certainly expresses a pro-Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist sentiment for objective reasons as they are a beleaguered community with no other option.” But, he said, the citizenship bill has “nothing to do with the Muslims of India. It relates to foreign Muslims who have infiltrated into India over the years."" The big question many Muslims in India are now asking is: Who will be considered an Indian citizen? And who will be considered an illegal foreigner?  Many of the people who failed to pass the citizenship test in Assam had lived in India all their lives, felt deeply Indian and were despondent to be stricken from the citizenship rolls. Some even killed themselves, including a 14-year-old girl from a small village.  Where all of this is going is hardly clear. Even if India rounds up thousands of people the government considers illegal migrants and puts them into the newly built prisons, it will not be easy to deport them.  Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan will be unlikely to accept India’s determination of citizenship, especially if it seems that most of those being slated for removal are Muslims.  India’s home minister, Amit Shah, considered the second most powerful man in the country, has vowed two things: to bring the citizenship tests nationwide and to protect Hindus knocked off the citizenship rolls. Harsh Mander, a well-known human rights defender, said in a newspaper column that these measures posed “the gravest threat to India’s secular democratic constitution since India became a republic.” Mr. Mander, who said he was born a Sikh, said that if the bill passed he would declare himself a Muslim to stand in solidarity with “my undocumented Muslim sisters and brothers.""']","The government says it is trying to protect religious minorities from being persecuted in Muslim countries. Indian Muslims say the bill is discriminatory, and protests are spreading."
Taliban Attack U.S. Base in Afghanistan as Negotiators Talk Peace,2019-12-11,By Fahim Abed and Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — As their negotiators resumed peace talks with American diplomats, Taliban militants on Wednesday set off a car bomb and penetrated a medical facility attached to Bagram Air Base, the largest United States military base in Afghanistan, killing at least two people and wounding at least 73, officials said. The daring attack on the base — which President Trump visited recently — lasted nearly 12 hours after the initial explosion, and it was bound to complicate the negotiations. After a year of talks, the two sides had been on the verge of announcing an agreement in September when President Trump called off the negotiations, citing a Taliban bombing that killed an American, a NATO soldier and nearly a dozen Afghans.  In the attack on Wednesday, a vehicle laden with explosives targeted the southern part of the base, the site of a medical facility that was under construction. Several attackers then entered the base, engaging in a firefight with Afghan and coalition forces, Afghan officials said.  Soon after the initial attack, a spokesman for the American-led NATO mission said the assault had been repelled. But later Wednesday, nearly 10 hours after the first explosion, the spokesman said that some fighters were still holed up in the medical facility. He said the medical facility had been badly damaged, but he insisted the air base defenses were not breached. Reports about casualties to coalition forces were conflicting. Initially, the NATO mission’s spokesman said coalition forces had suffered no casualties. In a later update, he said “some service members have been evaluated for minor injuries as a result of the initial attack,” but that there were no major injuries. The Georgian Defense Ministry said that five Georgian soldiers who are part of the coalition had suffered minor injuries. Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, said two civilians were killed and at least 73 others were wounded. By 8 p.m. local time, more than 12 hours after the attack began, all seven assailants were dead, he said.  “Houses were damaged as far as 200 meters from the scene of the explosion,” Mr. Rahimi said. Talks between the chief American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, and Taliban negotiators have been underway in recent days in Qatar after they were restarted by Mr. Trump in November. Officials say that both sides are talking about ways to decrease violence, reach a possible cease-fire and pave the way for talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Although both sides have engaged in violence across Afghanistan during this year’s negotiations, it was an increase in Taliban attacks just before an expected announcement of a peace agreement deal that President Trump cited for calling off the peace talks. During the three-month halt in talks, Western diplomats hoped the Taliban would return to the table with a realization that they had pushed their hand too far with the violence.  Wednesday’s attack, during the fifth day of the new talks, could cast doubt on the group’s intentions and raise new concerns that the Taliban’s political wing and the military side might not agree on how to end the 18-year conflict.

Saudi Family of Pensacola Gunman: ‘Even We Don’t Know the Truth’ of Motive,2019-12-11,By Vivian Yee,"['AL AHSA, Saudi Arabia — Not long before a 21-year-old Saudi Royal Air Force trainee shot and killed three American sailors on Friday at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., he called his mother and his brother back home. The trainee, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was wearing his uniform, they could see on the video call — the uniform he had always wanted to wear as a child, when he dreamed of becoming a pilot.  With his elder brother, Abdullah, he joked around on the call: “You’re the eldest,” Lieutenant Alshamrani teased, “but I’m going to get married first.” Talking to his mother, he promised he would be home as soon as he finished his training. “Just a few more months,” he said. What was missing was any hint of what was to come: opening fire in a classroom building at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, shooting three fatally and wounding eight more before being killed by a sheriff’s deputy.  Lieutenant Alshamrani seemed utterly normal in that last conversation, his family insisted in interviews this week in Saudi Arabia. Four days later, they are still baffled. “He never had a secret. He was never hiding anything,” Saeed Abdullah Alshamrani, 55, the lieutenant’s father, said  at the family’s home in eastern Saudi Arabia on Tuesday evening. “It’s such a mystery. Even we don’t know the truth.” “Are you sure he’s dead?” his father asked during the interview, surrounded by several relatives, acquaintances and others whose relationship to the family was not clear. “We haven’t even been given any proof of whether he’s dead or alive.” No motive for the shooting has been determined, although the F.B.I. is treating it as a presumed terrorist attack. The Pentagon announced on Tuesday that it was suspending operational training for all of the nearly 900 Saudi military students in the United States. Among the few clues to emerge was a tweet from an account that may be connected to Lieutenant Alshamrani and that condemned United States foreign policy decisions in the Middle East, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. There was also a complaint the lieutenant filed this year against one of his instructors for mocking his mustache in class. But in Saudi Arabia, the American focus on  possible radicalization has left family and acquaintances bewildered, forced to answer for their son and friend to other Saudis.  Sensitive to Western stereotypes that often reflexively brand Muslims as terrorists, and aware that the kingdom cannot afford to lose Washington’s support, many Saudis have been eager to portray the lieutenant as a monstrous outlier. A hashtag declaring that he “does not represent” Saudis has dominated Twitter in the kingdom, and the news media has echoed the point. “This work can only be done by a cowardly villain,” wrote Hamdan Al-Shehri, a political scientist, in the Arab News, a Saudi newspaper. “He has betrayed his country, which trusted him and spent millions on his education. Instead, he stabbed her in the back.” The Saudi government is also extremely sensitive about the case, fearing that it could jeopardize a relationship already frayed by criticism in Washington over the war in Yemen and the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other top officials have all condemned the shooting. Lieutenant Alshamrani’s family have said they were questioned by government officials. In interviews, his father, brother, cousins and a family friend said that Lieutenant Alshamrani had always seemed content to be in the United States, working toward his longtime goal, never mentioning difficulties. “Since he was a kid, he’d dreamed of being a pilot, and he worked so hard for it,” said his brother, Abdullah Alshamrani. Once he arrived in the United States, “he loved it so much, really,” his brother said. “He was amazed by America’s military force, just really impressed by the military.” The third child in a family from Tabalah, a farming town in southern Saudi Arabia, Lieutenant Alshamrani grew up in Al Ahsa, not far from the Saudi Aramco compound in eastern Saudi Arabia. His father had moved there to work in the local airport, eventually rising to be a security official. The family spent summers with extended family back in Tabalah, with its date farms nestled amid the undulating desert and stark mountains. They built another house there and frequently came back for weddings and other family events. On summer evenings, with other entertainment scarce, young men like Lieutenant Alshamrani and his brothers and cousins would gather at rented guesthouses in the desert to play cards and watch soccer on television late into the night. Lieutenant Alshamrani always seemed more serious and less boisterous than the other young men, recalled Galat bin Mitshoosh, a retired longtime detective with the local prosecutor’s office in Tabalah who knows the family. “I never heard anything political from Mohammed,” he said. “He was quiet, just a normal guy. He might talk about sports sometimes.” The Alshamranis were observant Muslims who prayed, he said, but their practice of Islam was not considered especially strict. A person familiar with the investigation in the United States has said that friends and classmates told investigators that Lieutenant Alshamrani seemed to have become more religious when he returned from his last visit home in February. During that visit, relatives said, he took his mother to the holy city of Mecca to perform the umrah, a type of pilgrimage that many Muslims routinely undertake. In his relatives’ eyes, however, they said there was nothing to indicate his Islamic beliefs had changed or hardened. He did not seem different, they said, except that he had shaven his chin clean. Always a good student, Lieutenant Alshamrani cemented his place as the pride of his family when he became one of the two students picked from his air force academy class of several hundred to enter the training program in the United States on a scholarship. Saudi Arabia has sent hundreds of thousands of young students overseas to study in Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States in recent years, but it was so rare for someone from rural Tabalah to study in the United States that the last young man from the town to do so before Lieutenant Alshamrani is locally famous. “I was so proud of him. He’s the role model of the family,” his brother Abdullah said. “I’m the eldest son, but Mohammed is a big deal.” Starting in August 2017, the Saudi government paid for him to spend a year learning English at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio before he moved to Pensacola for military training. He had already received weapons training at his academy in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, the family said. But he did not appear to acquire a gun in the United States until July, when he legally purchased a Glock 45 9-millimeter handgun in late July, shortly after obtaining a state hunting license, the F.B.I. said on Tuesday. Over his years in the United States, he shared with his family pictures of himself smiling in Times Square and in uniform with one of his American trainers.  A video he took in Florida showed friends splashing around in kayaks, as he laughed behind the camera. When he called home — almost every day, his father and brother said — he talked about traveling around the United States, hanging out with his Saudi roommate and coming home after graduation. He was counting down the months. So was his family. His father had told neighbors and friends in Tabalah that he would throw a huge graduation party for his son when the family visited next summer, according to Mr. bin Mitshoosh, the retired detective. All of the men from the town’s six tribes would be invited. When he called his family on Friday, Lieutenant Alshamrani offered to send his brother some extra money. He promised to be home soon. “I’ll call you later,” he told Abdullah.  Only hours later, that night, would they learn the news. Abdu Mansour contributed reporting.']","The father and brother of Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, who shot and killed three sailors in Pensacola, said in interviews in Saudi Arabia it was “a mystery” why he opened fire in a classroom.

They Came to Play Table Tennis. They Were Deported at Gunpoint in the Dark.,2019-12-12,By Patrick Kingsley,"['VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia and Herzegovina — For two Nigerian competitors at a recent table tennis tournament in Croatia, losing was just about the high point of their trip.  Days after their defeat, the two men say they were arrested by the police, robbed of their money and clothes, and deported at gunpoint to a country they had never heard of. The players, Alexandro Abia and Kenneth Eboh, had been mistaken for undocumented immigrants — the latest collateral damage in an increasingly aggressive campaign by European governments to prevent a repeat of the migration crisis of 2015.  Even though migration has declined dramatically since then, the authorities across the Continent continue to tighten their borders, increase expulsions and, in places like Croatia, crack down violently on undocumented migrants.  Mr. Abia, 18, and Mr. Eboh, 29, say they were not intending to settle in Europe. They are both students at the Federal University of Technology Owerri in Nigeria. They entered Croatia legally in November to participate in an international sports competition for university students in Pula, an ancient city on the Croatian coast. After being knocked out early in the tournament, the pair, who had tickets to fly home, say they decided to make the most of their visa by visiting Zagreb, the Croatian capital. On their last night, they were arrested by the police while on an evening stroll, and accused of entering the country illegally from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country to Croatia’s south. “We said: What is Bosnia?” Mr. Eboh said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “We thought they were joking.” But the police were very serious. Officers refused to let the two men fetch their passports from their hotel. The next day, the police drove them to a forest next to the Bosnian border, forcing them at gunpoint to walk south into Bosnia alongside a group of Pakistanis, Mr. Eboh said. “They said: ‘You go Bosnia, go, go,’” said Mr. Eboh. “I said: ‘Go where? I‘m not from Bosnia.’ But he brought up his gun and said he would shoot me.” The Croatian Interior Ministry has disputed the accounts of the two men, calling them contradictory and inaccurate. To support its case, the ministry cited news reports saying the Nigerians were abused and expelled on Nov. 17, but the police have said they checked out of their hostel on Nov. 18.  “The police have no record of them exiting the Republic of Croatia legally, nor have the police officers working on combating irregular migration taken any action towards persons with their first and last name,” the Interior Ministry said in an email on Thursday.  But the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations department that gave assistance to the Nigerians in Bosnia, reviewed the men’s documents and confirmed that their Croatian visas were valid until Dec. 3 — meaning they were in the country legally when they were deported. Records provided by the tournament organizers show they both participated in the table tennis competition.  The incident has highlighted the often violent ways with which European governments have sought to avoid a repeat of the European migration crisis in 2015, when more than a million people made it to Europe without a visa. Most traveled from Turkey to Greece, before heading to northern Europe via Hungary. But a deal between the European Union and Turkey has persuaded Turkish officials to make it harder to reach Greece. In turn, Greece has placed greater restrictions on those hoping to leave its northern borders.  With Hungary erecting a fence along its border with Serbia, the primary migration trail north has shifted westward, through Bosnia and Croatia. And to throttle movement still further, the Croatian government has employed a policy of violent nighttime deportations, seizing many migrants suspected of entering the country from Bosnia and forcing them back across the border without letting them apply for asylum. In interviews in Bosnia this week with dozens of migrants, residents and aid workers, a consistent picture has emerged of migrants being beaten, robbed by the police and deported without due process from Croatia to Bosnia. “Whenever we ask anyone what happens, everyone says the same,” said Semra Okanovic, a Bosnian government doctor who works with Doctors Without Borders, a medical aid group, to treat wounded migrants in northern Bosnia. “They get beaten, their telephones broken, their money stolen. Some of them have their arms broken. Some say their clothes are stolen and pushed in the river.” A third Nigerian, Sunday Awojobi, interviewed in northern Bosnia on Wednesday, said he had been deported in a similar fashion to the two table tennis players. Mr. Awojobi had a visa valid until March 2020, and a stamp in his passport showed that he had entered Croatia legally on Nov. 9. After an international outcry about their fate, the two table tennis players have been confined inside a government-run center in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, while the Bosnian and Croatian governments debate who should take responsibility for them. Their mobile phones were confiscated, meaning they can only be contacted by the center’s landline. “We have been locked up and it’s not fair — we are human beings,” said Mr. Eboh. Mr. Abia added, “You have to take us away from here.”']","Two Nigerian students, in Croatia for a sports tournament, were mistaken for undocumented migrants.

How Labour’s Working-Class Vote Crumbled and Its Nemesis Won the North,2019-12-13,By Benjamin Mueller,"['BARLBOROUGH, England — They trudged through a stinging rain to polling stations, streams of people who once powered the left in Britain: ex-miners, supermarket clerks, retired schoolteachers, health aides. But when they re-emerged, they had voted not for the Labour Party, the side that had shepherded them through decades of political upheaval, but instead for their old nemesis, the party long despised here for shutting down the mines and shrinking the British state: the Conservatives. “I’m from a Labour background: the coal pits and fighting Maggie Thatcher and everything else,” said Dawn Ridsdale, 56, an unemployed sales agent, as she stood outside the converted barn in Barlborough where she cast her ballot. She had opposed Brexit, but now wanted someone with the ruthless streak of the prime minister who had closed the mines, Margaret Thatcher, to sort it out, once and for all. “The country’s on its backside,” she said. “I’ve unfortunately had to vote for Boris. He’s the best of a bad bunch.” She meant Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, the upper-class eccentric who defied half a century of political geography on Thursday to tear through Labour’s old coalition of small-town, working-class voters in the Midlands and north of England, a block of seats once thought so impregnable that it was called the Red Wall. Down went at least nine seats that Labour had held without interruption since the Second World War. Down went a type of tribal politics in northern England, in which people inherited voting customs from their parents and grandparents, passing fights over mine closures and benefit cuts down the generations.  And down went Dennis Skinner, the so-called Beast of Bolsover, an ex-miner and Labour lawmaker whose fusion of socialism and pro-Brexit values had put him in control of Bolsover, the constituency around Barlborough, for 49 years. For Labour, which suffered its worst election defeat since 1935, the results signaled the end of an era of being able to reach into both thriving cities and left-behind former mining villages for votes. The party’s two wings — pro- and anti-immigrant, young and old, university graduates and tradespeople — were cleaved.  “It’s the detachment of the Labour Party from great swaths of the country, which they seem not to sympathize with,” said Robert Tombs, a historian at the University of Cambridge. “That leaves the party in a pretty dire position in the long term, unless it can miraculously reinvent itself.” The big, longstanding parties of the left started vanishing from Europe years ago as class alliances faded in a postindustrial economy. But the consequences of the political realignment in Britain, as in the United States, are much graver because their two-party systems prevent left-wing parties from simply resolving their differences by splitting. The left is now squabbling on both sides of the Atlantic, with both the Labour and Democratic parties grappling with a rancorous battle between young activists and more moderate voters. The results yesterday in Britain were a sobering lesson in the consequences of destroying age-old party alliances before new ones had time to germinate, analysts said. “You’ll have the pro-migration, culturally liberal left saying, ‘We don’t want to ally with racists,’ and you’ll have the socially conservative, economically left-wing part of the coalition saying, ‘We don’t ally with people who think we’re racists,’ and that’s a very, very hard argument to resolve,” said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. By Friday morning, Britons awoke to a Labour Party largely consigned to the cities of England. The Conservatives, on the other hand, harnessed the power of Brexit to storm districts where the party’s brand had been toxic for generations. In doing so, they replicated the success of President Trump in breaching the so-called Blue Wall in states like Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, exploiting a combination of anti-immigrant messaging and dissolving class allegiances to take seats thought to belong to the Democrats. Whether Britons voted for a permanent realignment on Thursday, or merely one long enough to carry them through Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn’s disastrous leadership of Labour, was the big unknown. But outside the pubs, churches, schoolhouses and trailers where people in Bolsover cast their ballots on Thursday, it was clear that many ex-Labour voters felt more at home for the moment in Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party than anywhere else. They bemoaned a decade of broken promises, many of them made by the Conservative Party, but bought into Mr. Johnson’s idea that the political elite, and not his party, were to blame. They were seething with anger: at immigrants, at Britain’s postindustrial economy and at the constant gaze of the country’s news media and political elite in the south, toward London. And above all, the people who made up Labour’s old base in Bolsover unburdened themselves of their withering feelings about Mr. Corbyn, spitting epithets — “Marxist,” “terrorist sympathizer,” “idiot” — about a man who made them far more unhappy than even an old Etonian like Mr. Johnson could. In Bolsover, the market town at the center of this sprawling district, one voter, Thomas, pointed from the polling station to where he had spent three decades working in a coal mine. For all its dangers, mining had held the promise of steady work and fair pay, and came with all the advantages of union protection now absent in the industries that took its place. But for Thomas and his wife, Christine, who declined to give their last name because they did not want friends to know how they voted, frustration at the region’s decline became wedded to anger at the immigrant workers who took the low-wage jobs that replaced mining. “Jobs there should have gone to ex-miners, not to foreign workers,” Christine said of a warehouse on the site of a nearby mine. “Instead you see ex-miners thrown in the scrap heap.” They had just been shopping near the warehouse, and found themselves among so many Polish people that, Thomas said, “we were foreigners.” Lifelong Labour voters, they broke from much of the party in supporting Brexit and then finally stopped voting for it because of Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, they said, dominated as it was by an economic agenda too far to the left and a leadership rooted in London. “It hurts,” Thomas said, though not all his allegiance was lost. “I still am a Labour man. I’ll vote Labour again when they get rid of this lot.” Britain’s political realignment holds risks for the Conservative Party, too.  Just as the Republicans in the United States seized the South, only to find themselves suddenly unable to win seats in places like New England, so too do the Conservatives risk losing their socially liberal voters in southern England if they become dominated by the ex-Labour heartlands of the north, Professor Ford said. At the same time, in a country growing more diverse, the Labour Party will eventually benefit from aligning itself to socially liberal values — but not for some time, and not unless its supporters spread out across the electoral map, said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. Many voters in Bolsover described a drift from Labour that started years ago, well before Brexit, as ties to trade unions frayed and the Labour leadership became identified with increasing immigration. But it was Brexit that cemented their vote for the Conservatives. While the idea of rerunning the Brexit referendum a second time had taken hold in London, it sounded to voters in Bolsover, Leavers and Remainers alike, like a serious threat to democratic legitimacy. “There’s been a referendum, and there’s a will of the people to leave, despite my personal beliefs,” said Craig Beddow, a retail worker in the area. “I don’t think the country can risk a hung Parliament, because we’re just static now. Despite my beliefs about Remain, I think we need to get on with it and let the country move on.” Not that he harbored any affection for Mr. Johnson, whom he called “the worst conservative leader in my lifetime.” Barry Salt, another voter, had similar sentiments, saying that Mr. Johnson was “a fool,” but that Mr. Corbyn was worse: “He’s going to turn this into a communist state if he’s left alone.” Many voters knew and loved Mr. Skinner, the longest-serving lawmaker running for a seat in this election, and some Labour loyalists said nothing could sway their vote. “I’d vote for a donkey with a red rose on it,” said Jason Vardy, a bookmaker, referring to the symbol for Labour. His father, Stanley, an ex-miner, felt the same way: “If I voted Tory, my dad would’ve shot me.” But for others, being a Labour lawmaker was exactly what was wrong with Mr. Skinner. Despite the lawmaker’s own pro-Brexit views, the Labour label put him on the side of the big-city elites who looked down their noses at the north. “If he weren’t a Labour man, he’d be brilliant,” said Malcolm Shaw, a military veteran and ex-Labour voter, after ticking a box for the Conservatives.']",The Labour Party’s devastating defeat in an ex-stronghold has grave consequences for a party: Its two wings — older and working class and urban and educated — appear to have irreconcilable differences.
Migrant Who Rescued Man From Burning Building Earns Praise in Spain,2019-12-12,By Raphael Minder,"['When Gorgui Lamine Sow heard shouts for help and saw the fire at a residence in eastern Spain last week, he didn’t think twice. Scaling a wall and climbing onto a balcony, he entered the burning second-floor apartment, hoisted the occupant onto his shoulder and carried him to safety. But Mr. Sow, an undocumented street vendor from Senegal, did not stick around for thanks and congratulations. Instead, without identifying himself, he disappeared as soon as the emergency services reached the scene, in Dénia, about 60 miles south of Valencia. A few days later, a local newspaper tracked down Mr. Sow, and moves are now afoot to reward him with residency. The proposal has been backed by an online petition that has gained more than 40,000 signatures in the week since the rescue. The authorities in Dénia have also said that the town plans to honor Mr. Sow with a special award. “I did what my heart told me to do,” Mr. Sow told the newspaper, Levante-EMV, about the rescue. “I have nothing, but I am strong and I can help,” he said. “I don’t like to see people suffer.” He described how he had acted after hearing shouts and seeing smoke billowing out of the apartment. One photograph showed him climbing out of the building with the occupant, Álex Caudeli Webster, on his shoulder, using a ladder provided by a neighbor. Mr. Sow, 20, told the newspaper that he had arrived in Spain two years ago. He said he was living with his partner and 7-month-old baby in Gandia, a small town near Dénia, in a doorless dwelling in which they shared a mattress on the floor. In an article published online in the Spanish newspaper El País on Wednesday, Mr. Caudeli, 39, was pictured with Mr. Sow. In the photograph, Mr. Sow wears a Superman T-shirt that Mr. Caudeli gave him. Mr. Caudeli’s nose, ear and wrist are bandaged as a result of burns suffered in the fire, which started while he was asleep. “He saved my life,” Mr. Caudeli told El País. “He picked me up like a sack of beans.” The rescue drew comparisons to the story of Mamoudou Gassama, a migrant from Mali who last year saved a boy who was dangling from a fourth-floor balcony in Paris. Mr. Gassama was later granted French citizenship.  The issue of undocumented street vendors stirs strong emotions in Spain. Most of the migrants come from Africa, and often have risked their lives fleeing violence or poverty. But many find that when they reach the European Union, finding a job without the correct papers is almost impossible. Spain has become one of the main landing points for migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The flow of arrivals increased significantly in 2018 after Matteo Salvini, who was then Italy’s interior minister, closed his country’s ports to undocumented migrants.  But this year the Spanish government estimates that the number of migrants reaching its shores has halved from 2018, in part because of reinforced surveillance by the authorities in Morocco, where most migrants to Spain begin their journey.  Disasters at sea are common on the often overcrowded and ill-equipped boats that carry migrants to Europe. Last week, an African vessel that was bound for the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago, capsized off the coast of Mauritania. At least 58 people drowned, according to the International Organization for Migration. ']","Gorgui Lamine Sow, a street vendor from Senegal, could be granted residency in recognition of his actions."
China Displaces Turkey as Top Jailer of Journalists in 2019,2019-12-11,By Rick Gladstone,"['China nudged past Turkey as the leading jailer of journalists this year, a press advocacy group reported in its annual survey, partly because of severe repression in China’s Xinjiang region and Turkey’s eradication of “virtually all independent reporting,” which has left many reporters unemployed, driven into exile or intimidated into self-censorship. The survey, released Wednesday by the Committee to Protect Journalists, also found that authoritarianism, instability and protests in the Middle East had led to a sharp rise in the number of journalists incarcerated in that region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt now share the rank of third-worst jailer of journalists, the group said. For the fourth consecutive year, at least 250 journalists were imprisoned around the world, the group said in a news release announcing the findings. It said President Xi Jinping of China, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt had shown “no sign of letting up on the critical media.” It was the first time in four years that Turkey had not claimed the dubious title in the group’s survey, as the number of journalists incarcerated there fell to 47 from 68 in 2018. But the group said the reduction did “not signal an improved situation for the Turkish media.” Rather, the group said, the reduction reflected the successful drive by Mr. Erdogan to “stamp out independent reporting,” with actions that included the closing of more than 100 news outlets. Scores of journalists are now in exile, jobless or too frightened to report on topics the Turkish government finds objectionable, the group said.  Other journalists who had been held in Turkish jails have been freed, because of shortened pretrial detention periods under new laws that grant appeals for convictions of offenses such as “propaganda for a terrorist organization,” which the group described as a frequent charge against journalists in Turkey. “Dozens of journalists not currently jailed in Turkey are still facing trial or appeal and could yet be sentenced to prison,” the group said, while “others have been sentenced in absentia and face arrest if they return to the country.” In China, at least 48 journalists are incarcerated, one more than in 2018, the group said, as Mr. Xi has “instituted ever tighter controls on the media.” A crackdown in Xinjiang, where a million members of Muslim ethnic groups have been sent to internment camps, has led to the arrests of “dozens of journalists,” the group said, including some incarcerated for work they had done years ago. In Saudi Arabia, where the number of imprisoned journalists has risen steadily for years, at least 26 are being held, the group said, the same as the number imprisoned in Egypt. In 18 of the Saudi cases, the group said, the charges have not been disclosed. The group found 16 journalists held in the reclusive sub-Saharan nation of Eritrea, including some who had not been heard from in nearly two decades. Other countries on the group’s top jailers list include Vietnam, with 12 imprisoned journalists; Iran, with 11; Russia and Cameroon, with seven each; Bahrain and Azerbaijan, with six each; Syria with five; and Burundi, Rwanda and Morocco, with four each.  The group said it also had revised its 2018 list to 255 from 251, having belatedly learned of arrests, releases or deaths it had not known of a year ago.  The list is a snapshot of those incarcerated as of Dec. 1, and excludes the many journalists who are seized by the authorities and released throughout the year. Based in New York, the Committee to Protect Journalists is a leading proponent of press freedom, and its advocacy work has helped lead to early release of at least 80 imprisoned journalists this past year.

"France’s Pension Changes Won’t Affect Older Workers, Prime Minister Vows",2019-12-11,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Hoping to tamp down the transport strikes that are choking France, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe promised in a much-anticipated speech on Wednesday that the government’s planned pension overhaul would not affect older workers and would have a limited effect on those now in midcareer. But he again angered the unions on a crucial point — pushing the French to work longer — raising doubts about an early end to the strikes, which have also hit schools and government services, and setting up a possible prolonged battle between workers and the government of President Emmanuel Macron.  Mr. Philippe, the president’s stoic frontman for the pension plan, said that through incentives and penalties, the French would be encouraged to work until 64, past the legal retirement age, 62, one of the lowest in Europe. He also made concessions on the start date of the changes, which would go into effect in 2022, but only progressively, and at an even slower pace for those, like railway workers, who are currently in “special” retirement schemes. But the new age target was too much for a critical moderate union, the French Democratic Confederation of Labor,  or C.F.D.T., whose support the government needs and which had held back from the strikes.  “The red line has been crossed,” said Laurent Berger, secretary general of the C.F.D.T. Union.  The militant leftist General Confederation of Labor, or C.G.T. Union, which has spearheaded the strikes, struck an even harsher tone, an ill omen for government hopes of easing tensions.  “We’re obviously not at all satisfied by the government’s announcements,” Philippe Martinez, leader of the C.G.T., said after the prime minister’s speech. “They’re not taking us seriously, and they’re not taking seriously those who are in the fight today.”  The most hard-line unions like the C.G.T. want the government to withdraw the whole project. Others, like the C.F.D.T., are not opposed to an overhaul in principle, but are suspicious of the government’s plans and want guarantees that nobody will lose out. France’s pension system, one of the most protective in the world, has been a traditional third rail in national politics, responsible for the downfall or weakening of successive governments. The current administration may not prove an exception.  Mr. Philippe warned his parliamentary representatives on Tuesday that he would not be waving any “magic wand” to end the strikes. And the disruption for commuters continued on Wednesday, with most subway lines in Paris still shut, and most medium- and long-distance trains canceled. Already, the effects on shopping, tourism and trucking are being felt.  In his speech, the prime minister notably excluded older workers from the pension overhaul. He also offered guarantees to those in a host of professions — including teachers, nurses, soldiers and police officers — that their pension benefits would remain intact.  But it quickly became clear that he had not backed down far enough to quell the social unrest plaguing Mr. Macron’s government less than a year after he brought tenuous calm to the “Yellow Vest” uprising that began over a gasoline tax and expanded into wider discontent over his policies.   Some unions quickly called for a redoubling of resistance to the government. The head of a major rail union, Laurent Brun, said a “toughening of the strike” was now needed in response to Mr. Philippe. And Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the leftist France Unbowed party, said: “Those who are now 15 are condemned to this points system. The others are thrown into an incoherent and treacherous labyrinth.”  Mr. Philippe said that the full effect of the pension changes would be felt only by people born after 2004, and those born before 1975 would not be affected at all, he promised. For people born between those years, only the period they work after 2025 would be affected, he said. The prime minister also fixed the minimum pension at about $1,100 a month.  “We’re proposing a new pact between the generations, one faithful in spirit to that which the National Resistance Council put in place after the war,” he said, referring to the 1940s body that coordinated the actions of the French Resistance and outlined postwar social and economic policies that became the foundation of France’s social security model. “It’s a profound reform of the rules, to correct injustices and to take into account the new realities.” But Mr. Philippe was firm on crucial points that brought tens of thousands into the streets and halted public transport: The “special systems” governing pensions for millions will be scrapped, replacing 42 plans with one points-based system for all workers. The new law would ensure that the value of the points would not diminish over time, he said.  The overhaul has been a central goal of Mr. Macron and Mr. Philippe, who have argued that getting the French to retire later and streamlining the pension system are necessary steps to put the system on a sounder financial footing. Mr. Macron wants to unify the system and do away with the special pensions systems that date back decades, or even centuries in a few cases. He would give all workers points correlated to the number of years they work, and people would cash them in upon retirement. Mr. Philippe argued that the government’s new universal plan was far more adapted to the contemporary realities of work: careers that are interrupted, that take place over several jobs and that start or finish at varying ages.  The government, he said, wanted to “guarantee the French a stronger and more durable social protection, because it won’t depend on the demography of professions, so that one’s professional choice won’t weigh on retirees. Our children will have less linear careers than ours. We’ve got to give them confidence that our system no longer seems to privilege some over others.”  Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.']","Workers would be urged to work until 64, two years past the legal retirement age, the government said, revealing details of a planned pension overhaul that has prompted strikes.

Foreign Experts Quit Inquiry of Hong Kong Police Over Lack of Powers,2019-12-11,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — A group of foreign experts hired to give more credibility to Hong Kong’s police watchdog while it investigated accusations of brutality has quit over the agency’s lack of powers, dealing a blow to the government. The experts said in a statement they would “formally stand aside” after concluding that the city’s police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council, had limited authority to conduct independent investigations. The protest movement has called for a judge-led independent commission to review the police’s conduct, a demand that draws broad public support. Critics say the council, which is stacked with conservative figures and unable to summon witnesses, is toothless. The government and the police force have rejected the protesters’ demand, saying the watchdog would suffice. The watchdog hired the international panel, which included policing experts from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in early September to try to give the probe more credibility. The foreign experts said last month that the council needed the power to subpoena witnesses and verify the police’s version of events. The experts said on Wednesday that without such authority, the inquiry would not meet the public’s expectations “of a police watchdog operating in a society that values freedoms and rights.” The watchdog had earlier rejected the foreign experts’ recommendations, with the council’s chairman, Anthony Neoh, saying in an interview with the Chinese news media that the experts did not understand Hong Kong’s laws. Pro-democracy lawmakers said the panel’s decision to pull out of the investigation only served to support the public’s demands. “The whole incident has become an international laughingstock,” Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, told reporters on Wednesday. She said the government thought seeking foreign expertise “could rationalize their irrational state of affairs, but now the opposite has happened.” The council is expected to deliver a preliminary report on its findings in January. Tanya Chan, an opposition lawmaker, said the experts’ resignations amounted to a “vote of no confidence” on the investigation. She urged Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s beleaguered leader, to persuade Beijing to support an independent investigation when she meets with Chinese leaders this weekend. The police have fired nearly 16,000 rounds of tear gas and 10,000 rubber bullets since the protests began in June over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to China. The heavy use of tear gas, including in densely populated residential neighborhoods, has prompted public health and environmental concerns. More than 6,000 people between the ages of 11 and 84 have been arrested in the continuing unrest. The police have faced increasing condemnation after being accused of failing to quickly respond to a mob attack on antigovernment protesters in late July in the northern district of Yuen Long. In late August, riot police officers charged onto a subway train, fired pepper spray and beat people in the carriage, further tarnishing the force’s image. Hundreds of thousands of people poured onto the streets on Sunday, six months into the movement, in one of the largest marches in weeks to pressure the government to meet demands for greater civil liberties and police accountability. But Mrs. Lam has refused to make any further concessions, raising the prospect that the demonstrations could continue for the foreseeable future. Tensions in Hong Kong eased somewhat after the pro-democracy camp scored a stunning victory in local elections last month, but the police say they are increasingly concerned about the threat of violence. The force said officers had found two homemade bombs containing about 22 pounds of explosives near a high school a day after Sunday’s protest. Ezra Cheung contributed reporting.']",The panel’s withdrawal is a blow to the government’s effort to meet public demands for an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality.
E.U. Climate Plan Would Sweeten Deal for Coal Countries,2019-12-11,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — The European Commission introduced on Wednesday its centerpiece climate strategy that, if approved, would pivot the world’s third-biggest polluter to climate-friendly economic policies and nudge coal-reliant nations with payouts worth billions of euros.  Known as the Green Deal, the plan would require many European Union member states to radically change how they operate their economies and find new livelihoods for millions of citizens, risking a continentwide backlash akin to the “Yellow Vest” protest movement that has riled France. The strategy paper, feverishly prepared over the past few weeks by the European Commission, the bloc’s administrative branch, has been described as a top priority for the next five years and beyond.  “Our goal is to reconcile our economy with our planet, and make it work for our people,” said the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. “The European Green Deal is as much about cutting emissions as it is about creating jobs.” It would legally commit all European Union nations to cut emissions from 1990s levels by at least 50 percent by 2030, up from the current goal of 40 percent.  It also takes as a given that 28 countries would commit to a net-neutral emissions target by 2050 that has so far proven elusive. (Britain is set to leave the bloc on Jan. 31.) In practice, countries that refuse to commit to the 2050 neutrality target will be swayed only when financial commitments are firmed up. European officials promise that will be soon. European nations are among history’s largest emitters of the planet-warming gases that have already raised global temperatures, and its moves to tamp down emissions are crucial to slowing global warming. But those moves could also encourage other major polluters — especially China, the world’s biggest producer of greenhouse gases — to rein in their own emissions. Officials gathered in Madrid this week for the annual United Nations climate negotiations were looking for two concrete signals from Brussels in the coming days: a stated commitment to ratchet down to net-zero emissions by 2050 as well as more ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 2030.  The European Union and China are scheduled to hold a climate summit in Germany next fall. But Alden Meyer of the Union for Concerned Scientists said in Madrid that China was unlikely to commit to stronger targets unless Europe did so first. The commission is expected to present draft laws in January for approval, although debate and input from the national governments of the member states are likely to water down its current proposal. Most of the policies are unlikely to take effect before 2021. Getting European countries to ditch polluting industries will not be cheap. At the heart of the commission’s proposals is a mechanism to pay out billions of euros to nations that rely on coal — especially the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. They have long blocked the European Union from committing to a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At a meeting of European leaders in Brussels on Thursday, the commission and officials from countries like France will try to convince skeptical nations like Poland that the compensation fund for phasing out polluting industries will be flush and willing to dispense cash to nations making the transition.  European Union officials said that the goal was to put down a relatively limited amount of cash — 5 billion to 8 billion euros, or about $6 billion to $9 billion — and use financial instruments to help pay for projects like building wind farms, upgrading railways and teaching employees of coal plants new skills so that they could find other work. The commission hopes the financial instruments will expand the assistance to €100 billion. They acknowledged that the cash component was small, but said they had to work within the constraints of the bloc’s budget was small. These sweeteners will be crucial for Poland and its allies, which view the European Union climate goals as out of pace with their domestic realities. They will try to squeeze out as much as they can for their domestic economies, setting up tough negotiations over the climate plan. The proposals are already being criticized from many quarters, underscoring how tough a sell they will be. Environmental groups like Greenpeace and many Green politicians in the European Parliament who reviewed the policies have called the proposals half-baked, rushed and unconvincing. And it is not only smaller European countries that need persuading. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, recently passed a law to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and meet Paris Agreement targets, but it still relies on heavily polluting industries.  For example, despite top-level political commitments, the influential Federation of German Industries warned on Tuesday that the European Union’s new emissions targets would “unsettle” businesses and consumers.

"In Johnson Victory, Democrats and Republicans See Lessons for 2020",2019-12-13,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Britain was still counting the final votes in its landmark election early Friday morning when Democrats and Republicans on the other side of the Atlantic began asking what Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s landslide victory meant for them: Was it a good omen for President Trump’s re-election chances in 2020, a cautionary tale for Democrats, or both? It had happened before, in June 2016: Britain’s angry vote to leave the European Union was seen as a canary-in-the-coal-mine for Mr. Trump’s insurgent victory over Hillary Clinton five months later. On Friday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump latched on to the idea that history might repeat itself. “I think that might be a harbinger of what’s to come in our country,” he said of Mr. Johnson’s big win. But if there are parallels, there are also important differences between this British election and the American one next year. Mr. Johnson appealed to the same populist sentiments that fueled the 2016 votes in both countries. But unlike in the United States, he also seized on a sense of nationwide exhaustion with Brexit, a desire to break the political deadlock and, as he put it, “Get Brexit Done.” Mr. Trump cheered on Mr. Johnson from the sidelines, even as the British prime minister desperately tried to keep a distance from the American president. That underlined another difference between the two leaders: the president’s disruptive style and deep unpopularity with large segments of the electorate, which drew comparisons to Jeremy Corbyn, the vanquished Labour leader, rather than to the breezy Mr. Johnson. For all his populist bluster, Mr. Johnson rejected a proposal to join forces with the hard-right Brexit Party, calculating he could win a Parliamentary majority without its help. In victory, he has appealed for unity with promises of funding for schools and the National Health Service, a big-government approach that would not be out of character for a European Social Democrat. For Republicans, who have fully embraced Mr. Trump, Mr. Johnson’s victory shows not just the continuing potency of populism but also its limits. For Democrats, who have been enmeshed in a battle between their progressive and moderate wings, the Labour Party’s defeat is a useful example, since party officials have long debated the risks of tacking to the left. Still, there is no equivalent in the crowded Democratic presidential field to Mr. Corbyn, a deeply divisive figure whom several Labour officials accused of blowing an election that his party could have won. “There’s going to be a huge debate about why Labour lost, which has ramifications in the United States,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center for the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “Some Democrats will say it lost because Corbyn was unpopular and the party had an anti-Semitism problem,” Mr. Wright said. “Others will say the party’s left-wing economic policy was the problem.” Joe Biden, the leading moderate Democrat in the presidential race, lost no time making the latter case. Speaking at a fund-raiser in San Francisco on Thursday, he predicted that the Labour loss would be chalked up to its extreme positions. “Look what happens when the Labour Party moves so, so far to the left,” Mr. Biden said, characterizing the analysis he expected. “It comes up with ideas that are not able to be contained within a rational basis quickly.” It was a not-so-subtle plea to Democrats to choose him over liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Johnson’s victory, Mr. Biden said, would also be interpreted as promising for Mr. Trump, since he is “kind of a physical and emotional clone of the president.” Sure enough, Mr. Trump, who has cultivated a close relationship with Mr. Johnson, tweeted, “Looking like a big win for Boris in the U.K!” and followed it up with a promise that once Britain left the European Union, it would be free to strike a “massive new Trade Deal” with the United States. Given the historically close ties between the United States and Britain, it is telling that this election was characterized more by the distance those on each side kept from the other. Mr. Johnson played down his friendship with Mr. Trump, pleading with the president not to intervene in the election during his visit to a NATO meeting in London in the days leading up to the vote. Mr. Trump is such a radioactive figure in Britain that the Conservatives feared his public endorsement would backfire on the prime minister. Until his congratulatory tweets on Thursday evening, Mr. Trump largely complied. On the Democratic side, liberal figures like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders kept Mr. Corbyn at arm’s length — a reflection, analysts said, of the accusations of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, as well as the belief that he was not going to do well. Among prominent Democrats, only Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and a supporter of Mr. Sanders, publicly endorsed Mr. Corbyn’s party. (A top official in Mr. Sanders’ campaign, however, also posted a message of support Thursday on Twitter. ) Stephen K. Bannon, former chief strategist to Mr. Trump, contends that the president’s victory in 2016 was “inextricably linked” to the Brexit vote. He views Mr. Johnson’s success as revealing deeper political currents that could threaten the chances of the Democratic nominee in 2020. “It’s not just about Corbyn,” he said. “If they don’t grasp the reality of the rejection of the program of Corbyn, they’re going to get a brutal lesson.” But Mr. Bannon said the election also held lessons for populists on the right. Mr. Johnson’s rebuff of the Brexit Party, which had proposed campaigning together on a hard-line, pro-Brexit platform, will free the prime minister to try to draw the Conservative Party back to the political center.  “You will see a limited appetite for populism in the Tory party,” Mr. Bannon said. “They see that they didn’t need it.” Some British analysts dismissed the argument that Labour’s loss was a repudiation of its agenda, saying that some of its proposals, like increased funding for the National Health Service, were popular with much of the electorate. The problem, they said, was the party’s standard-bearer. Mr. Corbyn’s hard-left ideology makes Ms. Warren look moderate, political analysts said, while Mr. Sanders is far more personally popular than the Labour leader. The Sanders campaign has calculated that by moving left, it can mobilize a multiracial working-class coalition, while at the same time luring back rural white voters. To some Democratic strategists, the Labour Party represents the worst-case scenario of that gamble: Moving left did not retain working-class voters in the British Midlands and the north — the party’s bedrock support — but drove off center-left professionals in the south of Britain, who voted to stay in the European Union. Still, Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College in London, said, “Bernie Sanders is an infinitely more effective politician than Jeremy Corbyn.” For Democrats, there are tactical lessons in Labour’s defeat. Mr. Johnson ran a highly disciplined campaign, pounding home his message that he would “Get Brexit Done” and avoiding debates over kitchen-table issues, like health care, which could have played to the advantage of Labour. “It shows the importance of discipline,” Mr. Menon said. “There was a simplicity of message.” Mr. Johnson also successfully framed his campaign as a revolt against Britain’s political establishment. Parliament, he said, had thwarted the democratic will of the people in not delivering Brexit. The prime minister bludgeoned Mr. Corbyn for his muddled position on Brexit. Mr. Trump is likely to use a variation on the people vs. the establishment narrative, attacking Democrats in Congress, who are on track to impeach him, for trying to thwart the will of the voters who elected him in 2016. As in the United States, Britain’s election was characterized by extraordinary rancor and a blizzard of dubious claims from the candidates. And, as in the United States, the peculiarities of the British political system guaranteed that the winner was not the party that got the most votes. While Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won a 79-seat majority in Parliament, they and the other pro-Brexit parties drew only 46 percent of the vote. The Labour Party, and other parties that either oppose Brexit or want to rethink Britain’s departure, won 52 percent. Britain’s first-past-the-post system — meaning that in each constituency, the candidate who gets the most votes wins, regardless whether that’s a majority — allowed the Conservatives to win a disproportionate share of seats. This has prompted debates about overhauling the electoral system that echoed the calls for reform after Mr. Trump defeated Mrs. Clinton in the Electoral College, despite losing to her by 2.8 million votes. And like in the United States, there seems little prospect of changing the system any time soon. Alexander Burns contributed reporting from New York, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.

"As Myanmar Genocide Hearing Closes, Focus Is on Trapped Rohingya",2019-12-12,By Hannah Beech and Saw Nang,"['BANGKOK — Half a world away from the elegant confines of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where Myanmar is being accused of genocide in a landmark case that opened this week, a Rohingya Muslim man was preparing to die. It was, he said by phone on Thursday, going to be a slow demise. His village in Rakhine State in far western Myanmar had been attacked in recent weeks. The rice had been ready to harvest, but Buddhists had stolen the crop. Aid from international groups had ceased. People were hungry, sick and desperate. “I have a home and a rice field, but I am just waiting to die,” said the man, who did not want his name used because he feared he would be killed for speaking out. This week’s dramatic opening in The Hague saw agonizing testimony about the mass slaughter and rape of Rohingya Muslims by Myanmar’s military and local mobs, followed by strenuous denials from Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who is Myanmar’s de facto civilian leader, that there had been any orchestrated persecution of the Muslim minority. But the three days of hearings, which ended on Thursday, had a narrower objective than deciding whether Myanmar’s treatment of the mostly stateless minority group constitutes the gravest of international crimes. A determination of whether Myanmar, a mostly Buddhist country, is guilty of acting with genocidal intent could take years to make. The point of this week’s legal proceedings, instead, was to determine whether judges need to issue an emergency order to protect the Rohingya still in Myanmar from what United Nations investigators say is an ongoing genocidal campaign. The judges said on Thursday that they would issue a decision as soon as possible. After decades of discrimination, capped by slaughter, rape and wholesale village burnings in 2017 — atrocities that have been well documented by human rights groups and journalists — there are now far more Rohingya living outside of their homeland in Rakhine than inside it. Over the years, about a million have fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where they live in a series of settlements that constitute the world’s largest refugee camp. Others survived perilous passages by boat to work as migrant workers elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Thousands more toil in Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia. The roughly half a million Rohingya still in Rakhine survive at the whim of a security state that considers them foreign interlopers. Their tenuous situation has been aggravated in recent months by open warfare between Myanmar’s military and another ethnic group native to the state, the Rakhine. In testimony presented to the court this week, lawyers for Gambia, the West African country that has brought the case against Myanmar in the International Court of Justice on behalf of other Muslim-majority nations, said that the Rohingya in Rakhine are facing mounting pressure, even the risk of starvation. “The evidence of Myanmar’s genocidal intentions has actually strengthened over the past year,” said Tafadzwa Pasipanodya, a lawyer on the Gambian team. Officials in the state, however, said the fact that Muslims still lived in Rakhine proved that crimes against humanity were not unfolding. “Gambia’s accusation that genocide is going on in Rakhine is nonsense because there are some Muslims still living here peacefully,” said U Win Myint, a spokesman for the Rakhine State government. “If you still can see them in Rakhine State, how can you say there is a genocide?” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has said that her government is committed to welcoming back Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh. But since the Rohingya exodus, the local government has taken over some of their villages, which had been razed by fire, and built security bases and government buildings on the land. Since outbreaks of sectarian violence in 2012, Rohingya living in and around Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine, have been confined to internment camps. Sittwe’s grandest mosques have fallen into disrepair. Others were reduced to rubble. Fatima Khatun, a 30-year-old Rohingya who graduated from what was once a religiously mixed high school in Sittwe, said her husband had died this year of what should have been an easily treatable case of kidney stones. “We couldn’t get him to the hospital in time,” she said, sitting in her wooden shack in an internment camp on Sittwe’s outskirts. “Now my family has nothing.” Late last month, 95 Rohingya, including 23 children, boarded a boat to try to escape the country, only to be caught by the authorities as their vessel rounded the bulk of the Myanmar landmass for the Andaman Sea. They are now in prison, charged with illegal movement, according to a rights group, Fortify Rights. Because most Rohingya lack citizenship in their homeland, they are not allowed to travel freely inside Myanmar. At the International Court of Justice on Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi disputed the notion that the military, with whom her government now shares power, had planned a genocide of the Rohingya. She accused the Gambian team of painting “an incomplete and misleading factual picture” of what happened in Rakhine and insisted  authorities in Myanmar were trying to help the Muslim group. Scholarships would be made available to Muslim students, she said, even though almost no Rohingya have had access to higher education for years.  Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi also said on Wednesday that Myanmar could depend on its own justice system to prosecute any crimes that might have occurred in Rakhine, obviating the need for an international court to get involved.  Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi pointed to a guilty verdict in which a military tribunal convicted seven soldiers for their roles in the killing of 10 Rohingya in the village of Inn Din in Rakhine in 2017. Details of that massacre were uncovered by two Reuters reporters of Myanmar nationality, who spent more than 16 months in jail for their exposé. U Aung Than Wai, a politician from the ethnic Rakhine minority, which is embroiled in its own insurgency with the state of Myanmar, was in jail with the seven soldiers back when he was a political prisoner. The military men were given premium cigarettes by their jailers, he said, and beer, too.

U.K. Election Result Starts Clock on Brexit Talks With E.U.,2019-12-13,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — European leaders on Friday welcomed the clarity of the British election result, since they, too, want to “get Brexit done.” But Boris Johnson’s substantial majority will only start the clock on new negotiations about Britain’s future trading and security relationship with the European Union. Few except Mr. Johnson expect the talks to be quick or easy. They can be quick, Brussels argues, if Britain agrees to keep its regulations and tariffs the same or very close to those of the bloc. But European leaders, in Brussels for the last day of a summit meeting, remain unsure whether Mr. Johnson, with his resounding mandate to ratify his Brexit deal by the end of January, will stick to his campaign pledge to finish any trade negotiation with the European Union by the end of 2020, or whether he will choose next summer to seek a year’s delay for longer talks.  Will this be the Mr. Johnson who vowed once “to die in a ditch” or the Mr. Johnson who reached his draft Brexit deal with Brussels last October by abandoning his red lines over Northern Ireland? In congratulating Mr. Johnson on his Conservative Party’s decisive victory, Charles Michel, president of the European Council, sounded a note of concern, saying, “We expect as soon as possible a vote by the British Parliament on the withdrawal agreement — it is important to have the clarity as soon as possible.” So long as the two sides are negotiating, Britain will be in a “transition” period, with its relationship with the European Union essentially unchanged, even if it will legally have ceased to be a member. Mr. Michel said that Brussels “will negotiate to ensure to have a close cooperation in the future with the U.K.,” adding, “The integrity of the single market is a very important issue for us.” Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said, “I hope that Boris Johnson ‘delivers,’ as he said himself during his campaign, because people need to have clarity, and I hope that with yesterday’s results, they do.” He added, “The excuse that there is no clear majority in London doesn’t last anymore.” But he suggested talks on the future relationship were “not going to be simple.” Brussels, in its conclusions on Brexit, is demanding a future relationship that “will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations and ensure a level playing field.” That is Brussels-speak for British regulations and rules that do not diverge too far from Europe’s. But if Mr. Johnson wants a free hand to make trade deals with the United States and other countries and to position Britain as more of a low-tax, light-regulation economy, Brussels will demand a tougher set of trade restrictions, unwilling to have a large competitor so close with significantly more favorable conditions for business and finance. European leaders have agreed that the negotiations will be led by Michel Barnier, who also led the Brexit withdrawal negotiations and knows the issues well. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said on Friday that Brussels would be ready to begin talks on Feb. 1, and that its goals were “zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping.” Eleven months would be a short time in which to finish a deal, she said, “but this is what we work for.” The talks “will be step by step but in an attitude that says we want to be good neighbors,” she added. Mr. Johnson may favor a hard deadline, but that will put Britain, which will soon be negotiating from outside rather than inside the European Union, into a weaker position, argued Fabian Zuleeg, head of the European Policy Center, a research institution based in Brussels. The risk is that a quick trade negotiation, considered almost a contradiction in terms by trade experts, could fail, bringing Britain and Brussels back to the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit. Many British businesspeople — and presumably some of the new Conservative Party members of Parliament from the industrial north of England — will want to be able to trade with Brussels with as little friction and paperwork as possible. That would mean closer alignment to the European Union than harder-line Brexiters advocate. “One advantage of a closer E.U. relationship is that there would be a better chance of clinching a deal by next December,” said Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group in a briefing note. “The disadvantage is that Johnson’s current Euroskeptic allies would oppose E.U. demands such as a level playing field on regulation.’’ But what British ministers describe privately as “the crucial divergence question” has barely been discussed in the cabinet, Mr. Rahman said, while noting that Mr. Johnson was likely to reshuffle his cabinet before too long. Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, has managed his key goal: preventing the restoration of a hard border on the island with Northern Ireland. But he also wants to preserve close ties in a future relationship, he said on Friday — “a trade deal or trade deal plus” — to “ensure that we still have a tariff-free trade between Britain and the E.U. and a set of minimum standards.” That way, Mr. Varadkar said, “nobody feels that there is unfair competition, especially when it comes to labor rights or environmental protection.”  On climate, the leaders said they had agreed on a goal of a carbon-neutral European Union by 2050, but in fact Poland secured a temporary exemption Friday morning, citing its coal-dependent economy and a lack of transitional funding, which ties into another complicated debate about the bloc’s next seven-year budget. President Emmanuel Macron of France expressed confidence that the Poles would go along eventually, and said the exemption “doesn’t slow down the implementation of the green deal.” Hungary and the Czech Republic also went along when they were assured that nuclear power would be recognized as an element of their domestic energy supply in order to get to carbon neutral. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, whose country relies on highly polluting coal for some 80 percent of its energy needs, said the negotiations had been “very difficult,” adding, “Poland will be reaching climate neutrality at its own pace.” Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary insisted that the less-affluent countries of Central Europe must get generous financial guarantees. “We cannot allow Brussels bureaucrats to have poor people and poor countries to pay the costs of the fight against climate change,” he said.']",Few expect the negotiations on the country’s future trade and security relationship with the bloc to be quick or easy.
"New Zealand Volcano Still Too Dangerous for Rescue Crews, Officials Say",2019-12-11,By Jamie Tarabay,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — Rescue workers on Wednesday were again forced to delay attempts to reach White Island to recover the bodies of people believed to have been killed in a volcanic eruption there. The authorities said conditions were still too dangerous and unpredictable to risk the attempt. A volcanologist, Graham Leonard, said at a news conference that the chance of another eruption on the scale of Monday’s explosion happening within the next 24 hours was between 40 and 60 percent. He added that for anyone traveling to the volcanic island now, even walking and breathing would be a challenge. Dozens of people were rescued after the eruption Monday, but the authorities later said that eight people were still believed to be on the island and presumed dead. On Wednesday, the New Zealand police released a list of nine people who they said were officially considered missing, seven from Australia and two from New Zealand. The police would not explain the discrepancy. Deputy Commissioner John Tims of the New Zealand police expressed frustration that recovery efforts had been delayed for a second day, but said the risks — including the hazards that toxic fumes could pose to rescue crews — outweighed the sense of urgency.  “My intent is absolutely to return to that island,” he said. “Those families and friends absolutely deserve closure, and I’m going to work really hard to make that happen.” White Island — also known by its Maori name, Whakaari — erupted on Monday afternoon as 47 people were touring the volcano’s crater. As of Wednesday, eight people were confirmed to have been killed.  About 30 victims of the eruption, which covered the island in gray ash, have been sent to seven hospitals around New Zealand, because the nearest hospital’s burns unit was overwhelmed. Most of the injured had burns over at least 30 percent of their bodies. About two dozen of the victims were Australian, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia said the country was sending three air force planes to bring some of them home. Other victims were from New Zealand, China, Germany, Malaysia, Britain and the United States.  Mr. Leonard, the volcanologist, said tremors on the island were escalating, increasing the chances of another eruption within the next day or so. “There are two key risks,” he said. “The first is environmental — at times it will be challenging for breathing, walking and seeing on the island — and there are risks for another eruption.” As of Wednesday afternoon, the GeoNet agency, which monitors geological activity in New Zealand, put White Island at threat level three out of five. After the eruption on Monday, it was raised to four.  White Island has long been a popular tourist destination, billed as offering a chance to get close to an active volcano. Before this week, the deadliest incident there had been in 1914, when 10 miners were killed after part of a crater wall collapsed. The island, which is privately owned, became a scenic reserve in 1953, and more than 10,000 people visit each year. Since Monday, victims’ family members and others have asked why tours had been allowed to continue despite warnings that volcanic activity had been on the rise. ']","Efforts to recover victims were delayed again Wednesday, as an expert said there was a strong chance of another major eruption within 24 hours."
"As Rivals Fight for Control of Libya, Erdogan Says Turkey May Jump In",2019-12-11,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['LONDON — The battle for control of Libya threatened to escalate further this week as Turkey said it might intervene to stop the Russian-backed forces now closing in on Tripoli, the capital. In comments to Turkish television networks on Monday night and again on Tuesday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pointedly raised the possibility that Turkey might send troops to counter the Russians if the United Nations-recognized government headquartered in Tripoli formally requested it. “In case of such an invitation, Turkey will decide itself about what kind of initiative to undertake,” Mr. Erdogan said Monday. On both Monday and Tuesday he referred explicitly to the possibility of “sending soldiers” or “our personnel.” Mr. Erdogan, for commercial and political reasons, has emerged as the last significant patron of the beleaguered Tripoli government. His blunt talk of a new military intervention underscored the perilousness of the situation now facing the Tripoli government, which is under a tightening siege by Russian forces backing the militia leader Khalifa Hifter.  Officials of Tripoli’s so-called Government of National Accord said they were open to any assistance that advanced its mission. “The G.N.A. welcomes ALL international support,” Mohamed Ali Abdullah, an adviser for United States affairs to the Tripoli government, wrote in a text message. Libya is a strategic prize with vast oil reserves and a long Mediterranean coastline. But eight years after a NATO intervention helped topple Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi during the Arab Spring revolt, the country remains mired in chaos. The bedlam has turned its beaches into a departure point for tens of thousands of Europe-bound migrants and its deserts into a haven for bands of militant extremists. Over the last three months, Russia has transformed Libya’s simmering civil conflict by deploying large numbers of fighters in what increasingly appears to be a determined push to help Mr. Hifter capture the capital. Mr. Hifter, 76, had been waging an  on-again, off-again fight to take Tripoli for more than five years, with no success. His most recent assault, launched April 4, left his forces stalled for more than five months on the southern outskirts of the city. Now, however, the heavy Russian support has enabled Mr. Hifter’s forces to renew their advance into the city. Over the weekend, they captured most of the neighborhood of Salah el-Deen, one of their biggest gains in months. “The momentum has definitely shifted,” said Frederic Wehrey, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who recently returned from a visit to the front. He saw signs of exhaustion among some of the city’s defenders, he said.  “If morale snaps, it is a terrifying thing,"" Mr. Wehrey said. “And who knows when it is going to give way?” A collapse of the government would most likely mean a prolonged period of bloody street fighting inside the city, with years of insurgency by regional militias opposed to Mr. Hifter and now facing revenge. The turmoil would almost certainly set off new waves of internal and external migrants fleeing, analysts and diplomats say. For Washington, Mr. Wehrey argued, allowing Russian forces to establish dominance in Libya, as they already have in Syria, would also “seriously damage whatever U.S. credibility is remaining in the Middle East.” “Russia is basically pushing on a door that has been creaking open for a while,” he said. The United States has largely withdrawn from Libya while the European powers have been divided over how to approach it. Since the United States began to pull back after the 2011 NATO intervention, an array of regional powers — all Western-armed American partners — have plunged into the vacuum, providing weapons and support to favored clients doing battle with one another. The United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and France eventually lined up behind Mr. Hifter, betting that his authoritarian style could restore stability. Turkey, in part because of its rivalry with the Emirati-Egyptian-Saudi bloc in a regional cold war, has become the only significant military backer of the Tripoli government. The United States, along with the other Western powers, also publicly supports the Tripoli government and a United Nations-sponsored peace process on the unity government, but only Turkey has provided military support. Washington, in practice, has sent mixed signals. United States officials, who say the Russian forces in Libya now include uniformed troops as well as mercenaries, have called their presence “incredibly destabilizing” and warned of “the specter of large-scale casualties among the civilian population.” But the National Security Council official overseeing Libya, Victoria Coates, met with Mr. Hifter two weeks ago to discuss peace talks, granting him a new level of recognition from the White House.  When Mr. Hifter began his advance, in April, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement condemning the assault on Tripoli, but the White House released a statement days later saying President Trump had called Mr. Hifter to commend his fight against “terrorism.” This week, United States military officials said that they believed a Russian air defense system installed in Libya had brought down an American surveillance drone. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, chief of the United States Africa Command, said in a statement on Monday that the forces that brought down the drone had not realized it was American. “But they certainly know who it belongs to now,” he said, “and they are refusing to return it. They say they don’t know where it is, but I am not buying it.” Before the Russian intervention this fall, the Libyan strife had consisted mainly of simmering, low-intensity warfare. A total of a few hundred untrained fighters at any one time clashed in a handful of deserted districts on the edge of Tripoli, as armed drones fired down from above. Mr. Hifter’s forces flew Chinese-made drones furnished by the United Arab Emirates, and the Tripoli forces countered with less potent Turkish models. But all that began to change as the Russian forces arrived earlier this fall. By October, as many as two hundred Russian mercenaries had arrived, and within weeks the number grew to more than a thousand. They brought with them more advanced air power, better coordinated air support for ground troops, and guided artillery, as well as trained snipers. With their help, Mr. Hifter’s forces now control the air. The Tripoli government’s Turkish drones seem to have disappeared from the sky, presumably damaged or destroyed by Mr. Hifter’s allies. “The Tripoli forces have nothing in the air now,” said Wolfram Lacher, a scholar of Libya at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “Everyone is waiting for the new Turkish equipment to arrive.” Mr. Erdogan spoke for years about avoiding conflicts in the region. But his talk of intervening in Libya follows a Turkish incursion into northern Syria two months ago, as Turkish troops moved against American-backed, Kurdish-led militias there and struck an accommodation with the Russian forces active in the country. In the television interview on Monday night, Mr. Erdogan pledged to appeal personally to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at a meeting in January. Calling Mr. Hifter “an outlaw,” Mr. Erdogan said, “On the Hifter issue, I don’t want it to give birth to a new Syria in relations.”  He added, “I believe Russia will also review its existing stance toward Hifter.” Mr. Erdogan has more at stake, though, than stability in Libya. His comments about a possible military intervention come just days after Ankara signed a deal with the Tripoli government that would give Turkey drilling, pipeline and other maritime rights over an expanded portion of the Mediterranean Sea between the countries. That set off outrage from Greece and Europe, but gave Turkey a new financial stake in the Tripoli government. The president’s statements, Mr. Lacher said, “suggest that this agreement is so important to the Turks that they are willing to do whatever it takes to stop Hifter from winning.”']",President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey might send troops to Libya to counter Russian-backed militia forces.
Brexit Is Going to Get Done. But on Whose Terms?,2019-12-13,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s landslide election victory Thursday clarifies British politics in one important respect: Efforts to reverse the Brexit referendum are now dead. Britain will leave the European Union next month. But on what terms it will do so remains unclear, perhaps even more so in the wake of the election. Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party rode a wave of frustrated working-class voters to a decisive majority in Parliament, radically realigning British politics and reshaping Britain’s oldest party. Crucially, that new coalition of voters may also shape the trade agreement that Mr. Johnson must now negotiate with Europe — and hence, the nature of his Brexit. The voters who gave Mr. Johnson the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher share few of the free-trade or deregulatory instincts of the Brexiteers who masterminded Mr. Johnson’s campaign or filled his last cabinet. These voters want safe jobs, protection from imports and the restoration of a Britain that vanished in the contrails of the global economy. That is worlds away from the agile, economically open, lightly regulated Britain that Mr. Johnson’s Downing Street brain trust envisions — Singapore-on-Thames, to use their preferred marketing slogan. Reconciling those two models will be difficult, if not impossible, even for an ideologically flexible prime minister. “It’s the abiding conundrum of Brexit,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. “The Conservatives have now become the party of those left behind by the forces of globalization while also being the party of free trade. All Boris Johnson has to do is satisfy both.” Mr. Johnson appeared to grasp the challenge. In his ebullient victory speech on Friday morning, the prime minister said he recognized that his new backers across the old Labour heartland in Britain’s Midlands and north were not natural Tories. They are better described as a disaffected rump of Labour Party loyalists, many of whom backed Brexit in 2016 and only “lent” the Conservatives their votes this time around as a way to get the job done. The prime minister promised to govern as a big-tent Conservative, forsaking the austerity of his Tory predecessors in favor of a social democratic-style spending binge, earmarking billions of pounds to bolster Britain’s schools and the National Health Service, hire 20,000 police officers and build vast public works projects. “In winning this election, we have won votes and the trust of people who have never voted Conservative before, and people who have always voted for other parties,” Mr. Johnson told a cheering crowd in suburban London. “Those people want change. We cannot, must not, must not, let them down.” Spending money is likely to be the least of Mr. Johnson’s challenges. He is a political chameleon with few fixed principles and an instinct, honed during his years as the mayor of London, to govern from the center. There is support across the political spectrum for an end to austerity, even at the price of ballooning deficits. But the coming negotiation with Brussels will force him into painful trade-offs that cannot be papered over with promises of more money for schools and hospitals. “Johnson’s entire pitch domestically is the antithesis of Singapore-on-Thames,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “He doesn’t have a mandate to eviscerate regulation, and they’ve never faced that contradiction before.” The Conservative Party has united around a vision of Brexit that would deepen those contradictions by diverging sharply from the European Union. Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal agreement, which will now sail through Parliament, hews to a hard-line version of Brexit, eschewing participation in the European single market or customs union. The idea is for Britain to develop its own free market. Mr. Johnson has until the end of 2020 to hammer out a trade deal with the European Union, an almost impossibly brief time to fashion a bespoke agreement. If he continues to refuse to ask for another extension, as he vowed during the campaign, Britain could yet end up having to trade with Europe on World Trade Organization terms — the equivalent of a no-deal Brexit. Such a scenario, experts said, would devastate Britain’s automakers, not to mention other manufacturing industries. That would reverberate through the industrial strongholds that the Conservatives carried on Thursday.  The new members of Parliament from those districts insist they will be able to curb Mr. Johnson’s worst impulses. “We can hold their feet to the fire,” said Lee Anderson, a Conservative who won a longtime Labour seat in the Midlands district of Ashfield. “A Tory candidate in the south is not a Tory candidate in the north.” That could set up an intraparty battle with an intellectually muscular contingent of Brexiteers who have spent years sharpening their ideas. Some of those people belong to the European Research Group, a hard-line faction that once exerted outsized influence over Mr. Johnson, holding him to his pledge not to extend negotiations with Brussels. In his last government, Mr. Johnson surrounded himself with ministers who codified their free-market, deregulatory principles in a 2012 book, “Britannia Unchained.”  But the election results have changed the dynamic in Parliament. Fortified with a 79-seat majority, Mr. Johnson can now afford to brush aside the hard-line Brexiteers in his party, should he so choose. A major indication of his intentions could come when he shuffles his cabinet after Christmas. If, for example, he replaces ministers like Dominic Raab, a co-author of “Britannia Unchained” and the current foreign secretary, with more centrist figures, it could suggest that Mr. Johnson will pursue a softer Brexit. Mr. Johnson also has to contend with resurgent nationalist movements in Scotland and Northern Ireland, both of which fiercely oppose Brexit and could use that as grounds to break away from the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists won more seats in Westminster than the pro-Britain unionists of Northern Ireland did. A vocal proponent of Brexit, Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party, lost his seat. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party won 48 of 59 seats, leading the party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, to demand powers to call another referendum on Scottish independence. The prime minister could be swayed as well by the fact that, however resounding his parliamentary victory, Britain remains deeply divided about Brexit. Indeed, parties that either oppose Brexit or want to rethink Britain’s departure won 52 percent of the total votes cast, while the Conservatives and other pro-Brexit parties won only 46 percent. For the hundreds of thousands who thronged the streets of London to demand a second referendum, this election will be a bitter pill to swallow. Although the groups that campaigned for a do-over never found a narrative to counter Mr. Johnson’s call to “Get Brexit Done,” they are likely to mutate into some kind of “rejoin movement” that will continue to agitate. Some analysts, however, are skeptical that Mr. Johnson will reverse course on Brexit. For one, agreeing to a closer alignment with the European Union would impose economic costs on Britain that would make it politically unpalatable for the Conservative Party. Moreover, Mr. Johnson is unlikely to pick a fight with his party’s establishment. “Boris is part of the establishment,” Mr. Wright of Brookings said, “and Brexit is largely a Conservative establishment project.” In his victory speech, Mr. Johnson voiced little sympathy for those who pined for a second referendum. “This election means that getting Brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people,” he declared. “I think we’ve put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum.” Still, while Mr. Johnson made it clear what he is against, he has not clarified exactly what he is for when it comes to Brexit. “We don’t know what he wants, which is remarkable after such a hard-fought election,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London.']",Boris Johnson’s victory has drawn in millions of former Labour voters whose vision of Brexit is far different from the Conservative establishment’s. 
"For Scotland and Northern Ireland, a Weakening of Ties",2019-12-13,By Ceylan Yeginsu and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — While voters across England embraced Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party, it was a different story in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where Thursday’s electoral earthquake has strained the ties that bind the United Kingdom and increased the risk of its eventual breakup.  In Scotland a constitutional crisis looms after the dominant Scottish National Party made significant gains, winning 48 of 59 seats, and said it would press its demands for a second independence referendum — something that Mr. Johnson has already rejected. The background in Northern Ireland is more complicated. But for the first time in its history, the territory elected more nationalist members of Parliament, who support reunification with the Republic of Ireland, than unionists, who wish to remain a part of the United Kingdom. Though the situations are quite different in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the common thread is Brexit, a project supported by English and Welsh voters but opposed by majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the 2016 Brexit referendum. “Brexit has completely transformed the debate in Northern Ireland,” said Daniel Keohane, an Irish political analyst. “Before Brexit, no one seriously thought a united Ireland would happen anytime soon. Now it’s a very real prospect based on these results.” In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, who leads the anti-Brexit Scottish National Party, said that it was “now clear beyond any doubt that an overwhelming majority of people in Scotland do want to remain in the European Union.” Then she demanded a repeat of the 2014 referendum in which Scots voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. This was, she added, an “assertion of the democratic right of the people of Scotland to determine our own future.” Such claims are unlikely to move Mr. Johnson, putting him and Ms. Sturgeon on a collision course. On Friday after a phone call between the two leaders, Mr. Johnson issued a statement saying that he had made clear to Ms. Sturgeon how he “remained opposed to a second independence referendum,” adding that the result of the 2014 vote “was decisive and should be respected.” But the reality is that the politics of England and Scotland seem to be diverging. So while Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won a landslide overall, they lost seven of their 13 Scottish seats despite their hopes that campaigning against Scottish independence might save them. The main British opposition party, Labour, which once dominated Scottish politics, now holds just one seat there. Removal from the European Union against its will is likely to feed a sense of resentment in Scotland, especially if Mr. Johnson’s Brexit plan proves as economically harmful as many expect. In Northern Ireland it was a sobering night for the party that had championed Brexit there, the hard line Democratic Unionist Party. Its leader, Nigel Dodds, lost his parliament seat in Belfast North.  The Democratic Unionist Party had propped up the minority Conservative government since 2017, and ultimately felt betrayed when Mr. Johnson struck a new Brexit deal that leaves Northern Ireland linked closely to the European Union’s customs market, effectively severing it economically from the rest of the United Kingdom and putting a new border in the Irish Sea.  But an even more striking shift in Northern Ireland’s political trajectory, analysts say, is the startling support won by the centralist Alliance Party, which gained 8.8 percentage points in Thursday’s general election, more than any other party. Unlike the territory’s main unionist and nationalist political parties, whose policies are mainly defined by sectarianism, the Alliance Party is neutral and has come to represent progressive and moderate politics across all communities. “The real story of the night is the Alliance Party in the middle, which is now our third-largest party,” said Newton Emerson, a political commentator in Northern Ireland, who describes himself as a “liberal unionist.” “The big change we have seen in Northern Ireland is that we now have a three-community system.” He said the troubled governance system created by the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 pact that halted decades of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland, “now has a third leg on the stool.” Frustrated by the political deadlock between unionists and nationalists that led to the collapse of the region’s governing assembly more than three years ago, many voters supported the Alliance Party, hoping that an electoral sting for the main parties would force them to revive the local power-sharing government. “The political paralysis has had great consequences,” said Marie Kelly, a trainee nurse, who voted for the Alliance Party in Belfast. “Our health system is collapsing, we just don’t have the resources and deprived areas are suffering so so badly.” Ms. Kelly, who previously voted for the Democratic Unionist Party, said she had wanted to punish it for focusing on Brexit alone and ignoring other important problems. “We need a more neutral political representation that prioritizes issues over ideologies.” Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of the Alliance Party, who won in the Belfast constituency of North Down that the Democratic Unionists had been favored to win, said his victory was tied to the values of “moderation, rationalism and inclusion.” The biggest disappointment in the election was felt by unionists and loyalists who vehemently oppose Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new Brexit deal. The unionists view the deal as a betrayal because it would require checks on goods flowing across the Irish Sea, effectively cleaving Northern Ireland economically from the rest of the United Kingdom. “The poll clearly creates the expectation that Boris Johnson will try to force the Betrayal Act through Parliament,” said Jamie Bryson, a prominent unionist activist who is challenging the Brexit agreement in court. “The unionist-loyalist community have been clear. An economic United Ireland will never be tolerated.” Senior members of the community insist that the deal breaches the consent mechanism of the Good Friday Agreement, which eased the legacy of bitterness between Protestant unionists and the Catholic republicans, who want Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland. The new Brexit arrangement, they say, threatens to inflame sectarian tensions. “If the political process has been exhausted then potentially, we could face some very dark days ahead,” Mr. Bryson said. “And that’s obviously something everyone wants to avoid.” Mr. Keohane says it is understandable that unionists are upset about the customs arrangement because it will be more intrusive than most people wanted, but at the same time he said it is hard to imagine them attacking their own state. “Of course, there will be some loyalists who will make a lot of noise about it. I don’t blame unionists for being upset,” Mr. Keohane said. “they have been betrayed by Boris Johnson, it’s as simple as that.”']","Both strongly opposed Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan. With that now a certainty, independence is in the air, particularly in Scotland."
"When Governments Get Complacent, Anger Rises",2019-12-13,By Damien Cave,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email.  What do the fires and smoke around Sydney, the volcano eruption in New Zealand that left at least eight people dead, and Bougainville’s vote for independence from Papua New Guinea all have in common?  During a long run yesterday, thinking about the Australia bureau’s stories over the past week, I began to see a theme running through them all: complacency.  The Cambridge English Dictionary defines it as “a feeling of calm satisfaction with your own abilities or situation that prevents you from trying harder.” Other dictionaries deliver even more scathing judgments, calling the complacent smug and unwilling to change even when confronting uncertain or dangerous situations. But no matter how harsh the definition, there is no denying that complacency — “the great chewing complacency,” as Aesop put it — damages lives in ways that bring sadness and rage. Let’s consider just the most recent examples, each of which offers its own insights on how a pattern of self-satisfied inaction might be broken. Prime Minister Scott Morrison came to Sydney Tuesday, on a day when bush fire smoke was at its thickest, and spent less time talking about the fires than about a religious freedom bill.  He was immediately pilloried by Sydneysiders who have become frustrated with his government’s refusal to actively address climate change through sharper emissions cuts, and more firefighting help here in a country where volunteers do most of that work.  At one point, when asked about firefighters raising money online for equipment, Mr. Morrison declared that firefighters didn’t need more assistance because they “want to be there.” That’s what did it. Outrage surged. The complacency broke, at least a little. The next day, he announced a boost of 11 million Australian dollars for more planes and helicopters to help firefighters on the ground. The Lesson: Climate change complacency tied to vested interests (coal, coal, coal) can be much harder to dislodge than the complacency around adaptation, which allows for more immediate visibility. Also: people risking their lives (in this case, for free) are powerful weapons in any fight against the status quo.  The tour operators who brought dozens of tourists to an active and remote volcano in New Zealand had gotten used to seeing the boiling crater lake and gas vents throwing hot fumes into the air.  They trusted local volcanologists, who said tour groups should be fine, and failed to plan for the evacuation that was needed Monday when White Island erupted, trapping 47 people. Eight have been confirmed dead and the bodies of another eight were in the process of being recovered as of Friday morning, for a total of 16 killed.  Ray Cas, an emeritus volcanologist at Monash University who visited White Island twice and immediately felt that tour groups should not be allowed, said he told colleagues in New Zealand about his concerns, but with 30 years of tour groups having passed through without incident, no one seemed eager to adjust or change.  “It’s the isolation and the lack of available of emergency services that is really a concern,” he said.  Now, New Zealand officials are just starting to discuss whether the tour groups should be banned, or whether more precautions need to be taken if anyone is to return to the island.  The Lesson: Tragedy, immediate and visceral, often does more to identify complacency and shift the dynamic than anything else.  When the Bougainville Peace Agreement of 2001 brought an end to the civil war that killed 20,000 people, many people in the region hoped Papua New Guinea would develop an equitable revenue-sharing deal for the mineral-rich islands before an independence vote arrived.  But in nearly two decades, little changed. And on Wednesday, nearly 98 percent of those who voted in Bougainville supported becoming an independent nation.

Conservatives Win Commanding Majority in U.K. Vote: ‘Brexit Will Happen’,2019-12-13,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party won a commanding majority in the British Parliament, a striking victory that redraws the lines in British politics and paves the way for the country’s exit from the European Union early next year. The Conservatives won 365 seats in the House of Commons, versus 203 for the Labour Party, according to the official results. That would give the Conservatives about a 75-seat majority, their largest since that amassed by Margaret Thatcher in 1987. As the results flowed in from individual districts, they pointed to a radical reconfiguration  of Britain’s political map. The Conservative Party was winning dozens of Labour seats in the industrial north and Midlands, shattering the so-called red wall that has undergirded the Labour Party for generations. For Mr. Johnson, whose brief tenure has been marked by serial defeats in Parliament, legal reversals and ceaseless upheaval, it was a resounding vindication. Defying predictions that he would be tossed out of his job, the prime minister is now assured of leading Britain through its most momentous transition since World War II.  For Britain, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the 2016 Brexit referendum, its future seemingly shrouded in perpetual uncertainty, the election provided a rare moment of piercing clarity. “It’s a remarkable victory,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. “Boris Johnson now has five years in power. Brexit will happen. Labour faces an existential question about its future — yet again.” As news of the Conservative victory began to circulate, the pound surged in trading against the dollar and euro, reflecting relief that British politics is likely to stabilize and Britain is more likely to have an orderly departure from the European Union. While the pre-election polls had been predicting a Conservative victory, the news for the party on Thursday was even better than had been forecast, with the Tories projected to gain about 50 seats, in excess of most projections. The Labour Party was set to lose about 60 seats, its worst showing since 1983, and one that seemed likely to lead to the resignation of the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The results, with their seismic shift in the parliamentary power balance, indicated that Mr. Johnson had won his bet that by calling another general election and throwing the question of Brexit back to the British public, he could break the stalemate in Parliament and win a mandate for his policy of a swift withdrawal from the European Union. There were, however, some red flags for Mr. Johnson, who will lead a Britain still deeply divided over Brexit. The Conservatives were tracking to win about 43 percent of the total vote.  The Scottish National Party was projected to win 49 of Scotland’s 59 seats, gaining more than a dozen seats. The party has stridently opposed Mr. Johnson’s drive for a swift Brexit, and its powerful performance could renew calls for a referendum on Scottish independence, which the prime minister opposes. The Conservative Party’s gains among working-class voters in the Midlands and the north could also affect Mr. Johnson’s freedom to negotiate a trade agreement with the European Union. Those voters will push for a revival of Britain’s manufacturing economy and protection from imports, a vision that is at odds with the free-market, deregulatory ethos of Mr. Johnson and his aides. One of Mr. Johnson’s top aides, Priti Patel, the home secretary, said Thursday evening that the new government would introduce legislation to complete Brexit before Christmas, a lightning fast schedule. But Britain’s departure would still not be likely to happen before Jan. 31, the date agreed upon with the European Union. Many in Britain grumbled about having to go to the polls again so soon, especially in the weeks leading up to Christmas, when the weather is cold and the days are short. But the stakes this time could not have been higher. Unlike the 2017 vote, this election clarified Britain’s immediate future for the first time since a narrow majority voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Mr. Johnson’s victory extinguishes the possibility of Britain’s reversing that decision, a dream that has been nurtured by millions who believe that the referendum was a catastrophic error and should be rerun. Polls show a slim majority of people would now favor remaining in Europe, though campaigns for a second referendum have consistently fallen short in Parliament. For the Labour Party, which had lagged the Conservatives in the polls throughout the campaign but seemed to be narrowing the gap in the past few days, it was a devastating defeat. The party struggled to shift the focus during the campaign from Brexit to social issues like health care, which play more to its benefit. One of the most senior Labour Party officials, John McDonnell, acknowledged that Brexit had dominated the campaign, keeping his party on the defensive. Labour had promised to negotiate its own withdrawal agreement with Brussels and then put that to a popular vote. That message was less straightforward than Mr. Johnson’s rallying cry of “Get Brexit Done.”  Neither Labour’s stance on Brexit nor its hard left manifesto of nationalization, tax increases on the rich and huge public spending increases resonated with an electorate that appeared above all to to be ready to turn the page, even if the post-Brexit future is a minefield of uncertainties. Adding to Labour’s problems was the deep personal unpopularity of Mr. Corbyn, who could never recapture the cheerful aura that seemed to surround him in 2017. Nor could he respond effectively to accusations of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in the party. Early Friday morning, Mr. Corbyn said he would not lead the Labour Party in “any future general election campaign,” acknowledging the “very disappointing” defeat. But he said he would stay on as leader for the time being.  Other smaller parties suffered as well, particularly the Liberal Democrats, which campaigned to reverse the results of the Brexit referendum. The party was projected to win only a single seat over what they won in 2017, and would see its total number of seats, which had grown because of defections from other parties, reduced by eight. The party’s leader, Jo Swinson, lost her seat. It is difficult to overstate the shift in Mr. Johnson’s fortunes from a year ago, when he was briefly a back bencher. As a fledgling prime minister in September, he had faced a mutiny from nearly two dozen members of his own party over his threat to leave the European Union without a deal. Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that his decision to suspend the Parliament for five weeks — to squelch its ability to debate his Brexit policy — was illegal. He purged the party dissidents and has largely recast the Conservatives as a band of hard-line Brexiteers. In the campaign, Mr. Johnson stuck to a disciplined strategy, forswearing the clownishness that has characterized his political career. He avoided scrutiny from the news media, declined to be drawn into debates about issues aside from Brexit and conducted his campaign largely on photo opportunities — like when he drove a backhoe through a Styrofoam wall emblazoned with the word, “Gridlock.” Every single Conservative candidate signed a pledge to support Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal agreement, guaranteeing that if his party won even a one-seat majority, Britain would depart the bloc under the terms of that deal. Early Friday, Mr. Johnson said that his government had received “a powerful new mandate to get Brexit done.” Once Parliament gives its approval to the withdrawal deal, Mr. Johnson’s first order of business will be to negotiate a trade agreement with the European Union, a task that many experts predict will be arduous and all but impossible to complete before Britain’s next deadline, Dec. 31, 2020. That sets up another potential battle over extending the deadline — something that Mr. Johnson has sworn not to do — or leaving with no deal.']","The strong showing is vindication for Boris Johnson, who now has a chance to put his personal stamp on Britain, beginning with Brexit."
Former Turkish Prime Minister Forms Party in Challenge to Erdogan,2019-12-13,By Carlotta Gall,"['ANKARA, Turkey — A former prime minister and erstwhile ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that he was creating a new political party, a challenge that could splinter the governing party and fatally damage the Turkish leader’s chances for re-election. Ahmet Davutoglu, once Mr. Erdogan’s closest ally, served under him as foreign minister and then prime minister until 2016. His break with the Turkish president represents a direct challenge as Mr. Davutoglu pledges a return to the original principles and ideals of their old party. To the cheers and whistles of a large crowd of supporters in a hotel ballroom in Ankara, the capital, Mr. Davutoglu unveiled his Future Party, saying that “the future is our nation’s, the future is Turkey’s.”  He told his supporters to focus not on the pain of past divisions, but on uniting and securing rights for all in the future. A second close ally and former minister, Ali Babacan, has also resigned from Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., and is preparing to announce his own new party within weeks, his supporters say. The two defections will not immediately threaten Mr. Erdogan, since he has amassed enormous personal power with the country’s transition last year to a presidential system. His current term runs to 2023.  But the moves represent the first major break within the governing party and could undermine Mr. Erdogan’s prospects for retaining power. “They will negatively affect the A.K.P.,” said Ali Bayramoglu, an academic and columnist with close ties to the party.  The two challengers could cause a realignment of the center-right conservative vote that has been loyal to Mr. Erdogan, he added. They will join an array of opposition parties whose tactical alliance succeeded in defeating Mr. Erdogan’s supporters in five of Turkey’s largest cities in local elections earlier this year, including Ankara and the country’s largest metropolis, Istanbul. His opponents have declared the loss of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan’s home city and political base, to be the beginning of the end of his 18-year dominance of Turkish politics. Mr. Erdogan has seen his popularity slide to its lowest level in three years, with a currency crash and economic recession that hit 18 months ago testing his leadership. One recent independent poll showed his popularity dropping to 33 percent from 41 percent in July 2018, a level that could see him struggle to secure the majority vote needed for re-election to the presidency, despite his alliance with the National Movement Party. The Turkish Army’s incursion into Syria in October, which was popular at home, gave Mr. Erdogan a temporary boost in the polls, but his ratings fell again as Turks suffered economic hardship and resentment grew over growing economic inequality. In announcing the new party Friday, Mr. Davutoglu offered a reversal of much of Mr. Erdogan’s increasingly autocratic rule, calling for a return to a parliamentary system, the rule of law and freedom of expression.  Mr. Davutoglu, 60, is an academic who has been an influential ideologue within the A.K.P. and has a significant following around the country. Sidelined by Mr. Erdogan in 2016, he had nevertheless remained loyal to the A.K.P., of which he was a founding member, until June of this year, when he broke publicly with Mr. Erdogan over his handling of the Istanbul election. After Mr. Erdogan’s candidate for mayor of Istanbul was defeated in March and he tried to have the vote annulled, Mr. Davutoglu published a devastating critique of Mr. Erdogan’s leadership, assailing his handling of the economy, his amassing of powers under the new presidential system and what he described as a takeover of the party by a narrow clique of self-serving actors. Mr. Babacan, 52, is seen as a successful former finance minister and deputy prime minister who oversaw the economic boom of the early Erdogan years. He is casting himself as the steady pair of hands that can guide Turkey out of its economic crisis, and he has been careful to avoid direct criticism of Mr. Erdogan. Mr. Davutoglu and Mr. Babacan are rivals whose past differences make a joint party impossible, but their efforts are being closely watched to see if they draw support from Mr. Erdogan and tip the balance toward the opposition. Both men aspire to inherit the conservative, religious A.K.P. constituency that Mr. Erdogan has successfully harnessed to stay in power. In the past, Mr. Erdogan has derided and cajoled those who have tried to break away from the A.K.P. But in a sign of how seriously he regards the latest challenge, he has gone on the offensive, branding the two men as traitors and calling Mr. Davutoglu a swindler over a recent property scandal. In a weekend speech to a gathering of party officials, Mr. Erdogan accused Mr. Davutoglu, when he was prime minister, of transferring ownership of public land worth more than $400 million to City University, a private college he had founded. The university used the land as security for a loan from a state bank, Halkbank, but failed to repay the loan, which Mr. Erdogan said amounted to $70 million. “They are trying to swindle Halkbank,” Mr. Erdogan said, including Mr. Babacan and another former minister in his accusation. “Where is your honesty?” Mr. Davutoglu hit back by calling on Mr. Erdogan and other public officials to reveal their personal assets. “The only accusation against me during my term as prime minister is the transfer of land to an educational institution over which I have no personal rights and which I cannot leave to my daughter, my son, my son-in-law or my daughter-in-law,” Mr. Davutoglu said. The timing of the City University revelations was widely perceived as meant to hurt Mr. Davutoglu as he prepared his political challenge. In Mr. Erdogan’s Turkey, the courts and public banks are perceived to be closely controlled by the presidency. Yet Mr. Erdogan has also been damaged by the scandal, since it stems from a period when they were all in government together, political analysts said. Despite the defections, Mr. Erdogan remains the most popular politician in Turkey. He has deftly stirred right-wing, nationalist emotions that run deep, with militaristic ventures in Syria and elsewhere, his calls to restore Turkey to greatness and his frequent challenges to Western powers, said Mr. Bayramoglu, the academic with ties to the A.K.P.']","As President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s popularity sinks along with the economy, onetime allies are trying to lure his supporters.

"Exposed as Stasi Spy, a Newspaper Owner Tries to Reclaim His Story",2019-12-15,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — When a wealthy married couple bought the Berliner Zeitung, a distinguished but ailing survivor of the East German press, they timed their newspaper’s big revamp for the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall last month. In an attention-grabbing two-page editorial, the entrepreneurial couple, Silke and Holger Friedrich, urged a reimagining of history since German reunification. They argued that 30 years after the wall came down, East Germans should wrest back control of their own narrative from the West, and stirred controversy by defending the last East German leader. But there was an essential piece of information that they left out. A week later, a rival newspaper reported that Mr. Friedrich, 53, had been an informant for the Stasi, the feared secret police of Communist East Germany in the late 1980s.  Instead of apologizing, Mr. Friedrich chose to come out fighting. He argued that he was coerced into being an informant and that he worked with his supposed victims to ensure that he disclosed little of value. He insisted that he has little, if anything, to be sorry for. But at the same time, he acknowledged that he could not be sure whether anyone was harmed as a result of his actions. “I’m not an Easterner who has to apologize. I’m not an Easterner who needs to grovel,” he said in an interview at his newspaper’s offices. In the hope of telling his side of the story, Mr. Friedrich granted access to his copy of his Stasi files to The New York Times and The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. He also had the former head of the Stasi Archives and a historian write an official report on his files.  In their report, the archivist and the historian verified the authenticity of the files, although they noted that there was no way of knowing whether the hundreds of pages represented all that the Stasi ever had on him. The case reflects the debate within Germany over the legacy of the Stasi and those who collaborated with it and how some perceptions are evolving.  In its final throes, the Stasi used an estimated 189,000 informants to help maintain its grip on a Communist state of about 16 million. It was a source of terror in East Germany and of deep shame after its fall. But in recent years, many Germans have taken a more nuanced view of those who collaborated with the secret police as it has become clearer that many of them were blackmailed or otherwise coerced.  “People are more willing to discuss the ambiguities surrounding those individuals who were acting as informers,” said Ned Richardson-Little, a historian at the University of Erfurt, in the former East Germany. These changing perceptions have also been reflected in popular culture. In 2006 the Academy Award-winning film “The Lives of Others” focused on the Stasi’s coldhearted methods. But last year, the film “Gundermann” was somewhat sympathetic in its portrayal of a real-life story of a Stasi informant, a coal miner turned popular singer. It won national awards and drew large audiences in the east in particular.  Mr. Friedrich’s file has more than 700 pages, more than 500 of them related to surveillance of him, rather than by him.  He was eventually dropped by his Stasi handlers, who noted in his file that he was proving unproductive. The extensive report by Marianne Birthler, a former head of the Stasi archives, and the historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk, noted that even if Mr. Friedrich was trying to avoid harming others, there is no way to be certain that he didn’t.  Asked why he had not disclosed his Stasi past earlier, Mr. Friedrich said, “We felt it was better to get the business going before this came out to be better able deal with it.”  His interactions with the Stasi began after he joined the East German Army in 1986. In 1987, after being arrested on suspicion of planning to flee the country and held in a Stasi facility, he was given a choice between prison or collaboration.  “It didn’t take me 30 seconds to make up my mind,” Mr. Friedrich said in the interview, adding that he had always been honest with his family and friends about his involvement.  In Mr. Friedrich’s file, it said his handlers instructed him to befriend several specific people. But he appeared to have returned with little valuable intelligence.  The storm around Mr. Friedrich’s Stasi file has become a public spectacle. It capped a turbulent introduction to public life for a couple who were little known until it was announced that they had bought the Berliner Verlag newspaper group, which publishes the Berliner Zeitung and several smaller titles. Mr. Friedrich made his money in tech in the past decade or two, including a stint at the consulting firm McKinsey, and Ms. Friedrich founded an English-German private school in Berlin. They promised to bring technological and business expertise to bear on reviving the newspaper company. Its titles retain only a small fraction of the combined 2.5 million circulation that they claimed before the wall fell. But several missteps brought controversy in the following weeks.  In one instance, they ran a glowing article on a business which Mr. Friedrich owned a stake in without noting the connection.  Still, the Friedrichs’ purchase of Berliner Verlag, for a price that is not publicly known, made it the only major newspaper publishing house in Germany in the hands of independent Easterners.  Their debut editorial attacked the bedrock of the official German narrative about the fall of the wall on Nov. 9. 1989 and reunification. For example, the couple suggested that keeping President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia closer to Germany might have been a wise move. But it was another remark that provoked more intense controversy. They suggested that East Germany’s last dictator, Egon Krenz — who was part of efforts to repress the peaceful revolution of the 1980s — should be thanked for not violently cracking down on protesters.  While some said they went too far, others welcomed the call for a rethink. “I might not share his opinions, but it’s about the question of who has the authority to interpret East German history and the history of the fall of the wall, and that is justified,” said Mandy Tröger, who teaches media and communication at the University of Munich. “Especially if you look at conventional media narratives, this op-ed can be seen as an act of emancipation.” Robert Ide, the managing editor of the paper’s biggest local competitor, the Berliner Tagesspiegel, said that as an East German and a senior editor, “I think it’s really a good thing that the Berliner Zeitung is being revived with new impulses.” Mr. Ide, who was 14 when the wall fell, did not criticize Mr. Friedrich for his actions as a young soldier —\xa0but he was less indulgent of Mr. Friedrich’s decisions as a rookie media owner. “We can’t presume to know how we would have acted under those circumstances, but we can ask ourselves how would we have dealt with it today as publishers,” Mr. Ide said. “He could have come out with it on the 9th of November, and it could have been part of that new frank discussion.”']","An entrepreneur took over a venerable Berlin daily, saying he wanted a new conversation about East Germany.

Greta Thunberg Is Taking a Holiday Break. ‘You Need to Take Rest.’,2019-12-15,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Greta Thunberg says she needs a break. The seemingly tireless 16-year-old climate activist — who has sailed across the Atlantic twice as she has become the most prominent face in the movement to fight global warming, and lectured the world’s leaders that they were not doing enough to address the problem — recently told reporters in Spain:  “I will be home for Christmas and then I will take a holiday break because you need to take rest. Otherwise you cannot do this all the time.” The activist, who last week was named by Time magazine as its person of the year, has faced attacks from the far right, as well as from the president of the United States and other adults who find her intense and her message that the world is facing a crisis unsettling. Now others have weighed in, including a German railway company. President Trump, who was Time magazine’s person of the year in 2016, called this year’s choice “ridiculous” on Twitter. He urged Ms. Thunberg to “work on her anger management problem” and to “chill.”  The Trump campaign also distributed a Photoshopped image of the Time cover with the president’s head superimposed on the teenager’s body. Earlier in the week, Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right president, referred to her as a “brat,” Reuters reported.  Ms. Thunberg also came under criticism last week when she joined thousands of students in the north Italian city of Turin on Friday to pressure the government to take action on carbon emissions. She had just been in Madrid for a United Nations climate conference. While addressing the climate protest, Ms. Thunberg called on crowds to “put leaders against the wall,” according to the BBC.  Critics scolded that she was advocating violence, leading her to apologize and explain that the true meaning of her words had been lost in translation. On Saturday, she said that she was “against any form of violence,” and that her remark had been nothing more than an unfortunate translation of an expression meaning “to hold someone accountable” in her native Swedish.  Then on Sunday, she posted a photo on Twitter that showed her sitting next to her packed suitcases on the floor of a German train that she described as “overcrowded.” The German railway company appeared to take umbrage, first thanking her on Twitter “for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change!” but adding, “It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class.” In a follow-up tweet, she explained that the train she had taken from Basel, a city in northwestern Switzerland, had been “taken out of traffic.”  “So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains,” she said, adding that she got a seat after Göttingen, a German town. “Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!” she wrote.  Ms. Thunberg emerged on the world stage last year, when she started skipping school to protest climate change outside the Swedish Parliament in August 2018.  Refusing to fly because of the outsize greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, she traveled across the Atlantic on an emissions-free yacht to make a fiery speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York in September this year. Then in November she set sail from Hampton, Va., to Spain for the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference. This month, the Oscar-nominated director Darren Aronofsky called her “the icon the planet desperately needs” in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times.  After Mr. Trump’s mocking tweet this week, Ms. Thunberg changed her Twitter bio to identify herself as: “A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.” Prominent figures also came to her defense. “What kind of president bullies a teenager?” Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a Democratic presidential hopeful, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. He added that the president “could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader.” Michelle Obama, the former first lady, also weighed in, telling Ms. Thunberg to not let “anyone dim her light.”  “Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on,” she wrote.

He Was One of Mexico’s Deadliest Assassins. Then He Turned on His Cartel.,2019-12-14,By Azam Ahmed and Paulina Villegas,"['JOJUTLA, Mexico — The recruits filed into a clearing, where a group of trainers with the stern bearing of drill sergeants stood in a tight row, hiding something. “How many of you have killed someone before?” one of the instructors asked. A few hands shot up. The trainers separated, revealing a naked corpse face up in the grass. One thrust a machete into the nearest man’s hand. “Dismember that body,” he ordered. The recruit froze. The instructor waited, then walked up behind the terrified recruit and fired a bullet into his head, killing him. Next, he passed the blade to a lanky teenager while the others watched, dumbfounded. The teenager didn’t hesitate. Offered the chance to prove that he could be an assassin — a sicario — he seized it, he said. A chance at money, power and what he craved most, respect. To be feared in a place where fear was currency. “I wanted to be a psychopath, to kill without mercy and be the most feared sicario in the world,” he said, describing the scene. Like the other recruits, he had been sent by a drug cartel known as Guerreros Unidos to a training camp in the mountains. He envisioned field exercises, morning runs, target practice. Now, standing over the body, he was just trying to suppress an urge to vomit. He closed his eyes and struck blindly. To survive, he needed to stay the course. The training would do the rest, purging him of fear and empathy. “They took away everything left in me that was human and made me a monster,” he said. Within a few years, he became one of the deadliest assassins in the Mexican state of Morelos, an instrument of the cartels tearing the nation apart. By 2017, at only 22 years old, he had taken part in more than 100 murders, he said. The authorities have confirmed nearly two dozen of them in Morelos alone. When the police caught him that year, he could have faced more than 200 years in prison. But instead of prosecuting him, the authorities saw an opportunity, a chance to pick apart the cartel from the inside. They made him the centerpiece of an off-the-books police operation that dismantled the cartel in southern Morelos, resulting in the arrest and conviction of dozens of its operatives. For investigators, he was a gold mine, a complete reference book on the state’s murder industry. For the sicario, the government was a lifeline. Watch ‘The Weekly,’ The Times’s TV Show on FX and HuluAn epidemic of violence in Mexico and endemic corruption pushed a police chief to try something new — an off-the-books witness protection program for assassins willing to turn on their cartels. Of course, Mexico’s legal system wasn’t set up for this kind of arrangement.  The nation has only one official witness protection program, at the federal level, and few in law enforcement actually trust it. Leaks, corruption and incompetence have left it in shambles. The police chief in Morelos at the time, Alberto Capella, wanted a witness protection program that worked, one he could use to smash organized crime in his state. So he simply created a clandestine one of his own — an improvised strategy that former justice officials describe as a legal stretch.  But if working around the edges of the law was the only way to tackle the scourge of organized crime, Mr. Capella figured, it seemed a small price to pay for justice. “We had to try something,” said Mr. Capella, who had survived an all-out gun battle with assassins years earlier, hardening his resolve. “We couldn’t just sit there and do nothing.” The sicario’s journey from hit man to state witness — drawn from public records, at least a dozen visits to the program and 17 months of interviews with him, his family, officials and other assassins — offers a rare glimpse into the world of Mexico’s ultraviolent killers and the lengths to which the authorities will go to stop them.  More killings take place in Mexico today than at any time in the last two decades, when the nation started collecting homicide statistics. Cartels fight one another for control of local drug sales and smuggling routes to the United States, while Mexico’s armed forces battle them all. The violence is the worst it has been since the American-backed drug war began 13 years ago, and assassins like the one Mr. Capella built his program around embody the crisis, responsible for a disproportionate share of murders nationwide. Killings have become so common, so expected, that the country has grown increasingly numb to them. Each passing year brings record levels of violence — with more harrowing expressions of it — and the nation’s institutions are so ill-equipped to stem the tide that Mr. Capella felt he had little choice but to invent a workaround to the country’s broken rule of law.  The deal was simple: The sicario testified against his former comrades and bosses, detailing the inner workings of a notoriously ruthless cartel. In return, he could walk free, without facing any charges. No paperwork. No signatures. No legislation authorizing a witness protection program in the state. Just a gentleman’s agreement, those involved called it. “There was nothing to think about,” the sicario recalled. “I didn’t want to spend my whole life in prison.” Through early 2019, the sicario proved so valuable that the police erected an even bigger wildcat program around him, recruiting more than a dozen cartel henchmen and housing them in a small, worn-down building attached to the local prison. Together, their testimony led to 100 convictions and helped cut homicides, kidnappings and extortion in the state, at least for a time, officials said. Even as violence soared across Mexico, it was down in southern Morelos.  Countrywide, nearly 100 people were being killed every day, often in horrible ways that stretched the bounds of human imagination. Fewer than 5 percent of those cases were ever solved.  With such dismal conviction rates, Mr. Capella felt, Mexico was practically issuing licenses to kill. His program, explicitly authorized by law or not, was a chance to do what hundreds of other officers could only dream of: pinpoint and lock up the assassins driving the country’s homicide crisis. The unchecked power of organized crime was on full display this October, when hundreds of gunmen for the Sinaloa Cartel laid siege to the city of Culiacán in broad daylight, forcing the government to surrender a notable cartel figure — the son of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the drug lord known as “El Chapo” — and set him loose, right back into the underworld. One of Mexico’s most notorious drug cartels turned a city into a war zone for a day to rescue El Chapo’s son. Watch the “‘The Siege of Culiacán” to see how gunmen took on the army — and won. Soon after, a different cartel gunned down nine Mormon mothers and children, another haunting reminder of the toll taken on innocent civilians. In the aftermath, President Trump threatened to designate the cartels as terrorist groups. Mr. Capella was well aware that his own solution to the cartels was dangerous, particularly because it relied on the unsavory prospect of setting a prolific killer free. “It’s something few have dared to do,” the police chief acknowledged, “but it is worth the risk.” But no one, least of all the sicario, expected how the arrangement would end.  Mr. Capella moved on to another job almost 1,000 miles away, and the program slowly collapsed. With no legal mandate or official support, it buckled this year under the change in political winds. Some of the witnesses left and returned to lives of crime. At least one was murdered. The sicario stayed until the summer when, fearful the police were going to hand him over to his cartel enemies, he fled.  Gunmen were not far behind. His brother — who studiously avoided crime and had enlisted in Mexico’s armed forces — was killed days later. His parents found a note attached to the body: This is what happens to snitches, it warned.  “This is the way things work in Mexico,” the sicario, who asked that his name not be used for his family’s safety, said while on the run. “And I want the world to see it.” The cartel bosses huddled in a small group, taunting him. Sure, he could rob, even fight, his fellow gangsters teased him. But he couldn’t kill, they said. He didn’t have the heart. They snickered, pushing to see how far he would go. He knew it was a test.  He was 17 and working for Guerreros Unidos, a cartel that operated across several states and smuggled heroin to the United States. Right away, he distinguished himself as smart and naturally violent. A prospect in their world. He snapped back. They didn’t know what he was capable of, he said. In truth, he didn’t either.  His fellow gangsters pointed down the street at two young men — a pair of unwitting targets. He took off toward them, wondering if his bosses were right, that he couldn’t take a life. Then, as if someone else was controlling his movements, he pulled a small knife from his pocket and, without any warning, slit the throat of the young man closest to him. As the blood spewed, he recalled, he buried his fear, determined to prove he was merciless, the essence of a sicario. “I blocked myself, my own emotions, and told myself it was someone else doing it,” he said. He later discovered that the two men were innocent, part of a game his bosses were playing. They hadn’t expected him to actually kill anyone.  When word spread, and the glow of admiration came from friends and others, his guilt subsided. No one would question him again. He was on the path now, brutal and immutable, to becoming a professional killer. “They liked this,” he recalled. “This opened up a career for me.” In more than a dozen interviews, the sicario said his childhood was normal, even good. His parents were together. They taught him to care for others. “I was taught values, principles,” he said. Tall and slender, with a round face and hooded eyes, he moved with the economy of an athlete, which he was. He once hoped to play professional soccer, but he skipped school to hang out with a small gang, smoking pot and getting into fights. Eventually, he dropped out.  Some days, he followed his father to work, joining him on his rounds for the local water company. For a while, he thought about making a life of such work, however mundane and underpaid. Then his father lost his job, plunging the family toward financial ruin. His mother began working from dusk until dawn for a few dollars a day. With growing resentment, he watched the humiliation and low pay of day labor, while local gangsters made big money, enjoying a respect that bordered on fear. “That’s when I chose to live day by day,” he said. “I became a criminal.” He worked his way up, from a small-time lookout for Guerreros Unidos to robbery and drug sales. The leaders noticed his ambition. After that first killing, the cartel leader offered him a slot in the sicario training camp. It was 2012, and Mexico’s war on drugs was in its sixth year. Violence had reached record highs as the military took to the streets to combat organized crime and the cartels battled one another for supremacy. Murder became a form of messaging, a spectacle of sadism — bodies hanging from bridges, chopped in pieces, deposited in public plazas, each grisly crime scene a warning, a way of saying the cartel’s violence knew no limits. As the drug market churned, with new players rising and falling, training camps became academies for the industry’s enforcers. The sicario saw an opportunity. For six months, he lived in austerity with dozens of other men in the mountains of southern Mexico, he said, through terror, starvation and cold. Everywhere the specter of death. They hunted and killed rival cartel members, and were killed themselves, often by their own trainers who disposed of them for disobeying orders or showing hesitation, he said. Trainees who ran afoul of the instructors were strung up from trees and used for target practice, he recalled — a claim that experts on cartels found plausible. Knowing he might die for failing to follow orders — whether killing a farmer, cutting up a body or torturing a friend — was all the incentive he needed to do the unthinkable. At least that’s how he justified it. “They turned me into an animal,” he said.  But behind every decision, every inhuman act, was a truth he could not escape. He chose this life. It was what he wanted.  In a year, he had transformed into a skilled assassin — battle-tested and not yet 20 years old. After the training camp, he was sent to Acapulco, he said, to fight other cartels for the lucrative drug market in tourist districts.  A year or so later, he returned, but to a very different Morelos. His old boss had been gunned down and his old cartel, Guerreros Unidos, was nearly vanquished there, swallowed up by its one-time allies, Los Rojos. The sicario no longer had a champion, or any allegiance at all. Some of his old comrades had switched sides, which happened in cartel warfare, the winners subsuming the losers. The Rojos leader, Santiago Mazari Hernández, known on the street as El Carrete, sent an emissary to recruit the sicario. He wanted him to help set up drug operations across southern Morelos state. The past was the past, he said.  “It was join them or be killed,” the sicario recalled.  They began selling drugs in Jojutla, then spread to Tlaltizapan, Tlaquiltenango, Zacatepec, fighting off other groups in the small towns across southern Morelos. As their business expanded, so did their influence, especially on local government. They had local officials everywhere on the payroll, the sicario said, to prevent surprises like arrests or seizures. Expanding operations meant cleaning out the competition, not just other cartels, but also local criminals — thieves, rapists, small-time drug dealers and snitches. Anyone who drew police scrutiny. Murder was rarely for sport, the sicario said. He studied his victims at length, investigating the complaints against them. Once confirmed, he warned them to stop, mostly to keep them from drawing too much attention from the authorities. If they didn’t, he planned the killings meticulously, carrying them out only with approval from above. “For me to kill someone, I had to have permission,” he explained. “Why do I want to kill that person? Not because I just don’t like them. That’s not how it works.” He followed a code, he said. He didn’t recruit children, and wouldn’t harm women or working people, if he could avoid it. But the workings of organized crime were rarely orderly. He did kill women and innocent civilians. For all the talk of honoring a code, it was often just that: talk. Business always came first. The New York Times confirmed many of his homicides with the authorities and attempted to speak with the victims’ families in several cases. All refused. Having lost their daughters, sons and fathers to the cartel, they were fearful of reprisals. Of all the people the sicario killed in his five-year run, only a few haunted him, he said. One in particular. It was during a routine operation, he recalled, when his bosses sent him to eliminate a group of local kidnappers. After he arrived, he said, he found a college student with them. The sicario said he knew instantly the student was innocent: the look of terror on his face, his body language, even his clothes. They were all wrong. Following protocol, the sicario tied everyone up and called his boss. He wanted to let the young man go. He was unaffiliated. There was no need to kill him. But the boss said no. Any witness was a liability. As the boy begged for his life, the sicario said he looked away and told him he was sorry before slitting his throat. “That student still haunts me,” he said, weeping. “I see his face, that kid begging me for his life. I will never forget his eyes. He was the only one who ever looked at me that way.” Sometimes, in the dark, the sicario’s mother quietly knelt beside his bed, whispering over him as he slept. She knew he worked for the cartels, even if she didn’t know how exactly. Prayer was all she had left. “Stop doing that,” he recalled telling her one night. “Your God can’t save me.” By late 2016, he had grown numb to killing, hunting for targets with a mechanical indifference. Life mattered even less to him, his own included. He received a promotion, which brought higher pay, more responsibilities and the envy of others. He still worked for El Carrete, who ran Los Rojos cartel, but he was consumed by paranoia, and for good reason. The deeper he descended into the underworld, the more he understood the petty rivalries among the leadership. Their lives were steeped in mistrust. The work demanded it. Friends betrayed friends, right-hand men killed bosses.  He was told to kill members of his own team by leaders who worried they were growing too influential or undisciplined. He said he killed so many that he began to reconsider whom he hired. “I almost never recruited within my friendship circles,” he said. “I would recruit whatever guy wanted easy money.” But that left him vulnerable, unable to trust his team. It proved to be his undoing.  In May of 2017, the police took one of his partners into custody. To avoid prison, he promised them the sicario. On May 15, the partner called the sicario. They had work to do, he said. It was bright outside, odd working hours for the men, but there was an emergency, his partner said. They met up at a safe house and left together, heading toward their motorcycles parked down the street. The sicario heard the police before he saw them, the screech of tires, the revved engines. It was over in less than a minute. He cursed himself on the way to the station. For years, he had survived on suspicion, yet somehow missed this easy setup. He wondered whether dumb luck alone had saved him all these years. At the station in Jojutla, a small white building facing the district prison, police commanders confiscated his phone. It contained enough evidence to put him away for life. While he sat handcuffed to a chair, the officers watched a snuff film of his work, which he had recorded on his phone. In it, one of the cartel’s lawyers, who had gone missing, sat in the shallow eddy of a river, bloody and terror-stricken, confessing a betrayal. The police called his mother, who refused to believe them. Yes, she knew her son was a criminal, she recalled. But she refused to believe he was a killer — until an officer made her watch an interview in which her son confessed to his myriad homicides. “We never taught him these things,” she said, sobbing. “He didn’t learn that malice from us. We gave him love and support.” The police began adding up what they knew, starting with several homicides that traced back to him. He faced 240 years in prison for those alone. But the police chief, Mr. Capella, had grown weary of the state’s limited tools and ambitions. Sloppy forensics, corrupt officers and haphazard investigations left few cases solved.  He had previously been a police chief in Tijuana, where the local press nicknamed him Rambo in 2007 for fighting off dozens of cartel assassins in an all-out battle that riddled his home with bullets. Now, as the commander in Morelos, he wanted results. As the sicario sat in a ripped vinyl chair in the precinct, one of Mr. Capella’s deputies explained the arrangement. The sicario would testify against his former comrades, detailing the many murders they had committed. But instead of describing the sicario in court or in case files as one of the killers or main conspirators, the state authorities listed him as a witness — someone with no real involvement in the crime.  The sicario, then 22, agreed to live in a building next to the prison for his own protection and be shuttled to public hearings. The state authorities did not charge him with any of the killings, choosing to wait until he was done testifying. Then, they could decide how to prosecute him, if at all.  By law, cartel cases in Mexico are supposed to be handled at the federal level, by a division tasked with investigating organized crime. The group can use its plea bargain powers to persuade witnesses to come forward, though few do. It is widely distrusted. At the state level, no such program exists, and officials have often found their own ways of chasing justice, sometimes by breaking the law entirely. Many have held suspects in detention for years before trial as a form of punishment, knowing they didn’t have the evidence for a conviction. Others have opted for a more brutal solution: the extrajudicial killing of suspected criminals. Mr. Capella tried a very different approach — looking for convictions in court, and ginning up a new set of rules to secure them. Tired of Mexico’s feeble rule of law, Mr. Capella decided to create his own version of it. His unorthodox methods and unapologetic manner have brought him controversy, and plenty of enemies. The current government of Morelos has accused him of misappropriating funds in a separate matter, which he strongly denies. Some former justice officials in Mexico call his witness protection program a stretch, operating well outside of legal norms. Others say it is so unusual that they are not quite sure. Even state officials in Morelos who supported the program acknowledged that it operated in a legal gray area, though, like Mr. Capella, they called it legal, defensible — and highly effective. “I’d rather make a big mistake than be guilty of inaction,” Mr. Capella said. “Mexico is tired of this institutional paralysis.”  For five years, the sicario lived as two different people: the son who dropped off groceries for his mother and had a baby of his own with his girlfriend; and the “monster,” as he called himself, who killed for a few hundred dollars a week. After his arrest, the wall between them began to crack. He suffered what seemed like psychotic episodes, he said, sleepless nights of strange voices and shadows collapsing on him. He knew he deserved no pity, that he alone was to blame. He took some comfort in that. “I was at the point of going crazy,” he said. “I would spend two or three days crying.” Eventually, a pastor — an uneducated, reformed convict himself — came to see him. At first, the sicario worried the man was a spy sent by his enemies. Eventually, he began to speak to him and, before long, could hardly stop.  The pastor was caught off guard by the torrent of confessions as the sicario gave himself over to the Bible with a fervor he once held for violence, a conversion so common it is almost a cliché in the world of gangs and cartels.  “That other person is dead,” the sicario said as if, with repetition, it might become true. He found new purpose in confinement, helping solve cold cases, testifying against cartel players and paving the way for some two dozen convictions. The police said they saw a real transformation in him, though they had their own reasons to believe it, too. By October of 2018, the police had expanded the program to include a dozen cooperating witnesses. With no other place to put them, the authorities housed the young men right next door to the jail that held the cartel members they were testifying against. Every few weeks, the police ferried them to court to provide evidence in cases.  The witnesses slept on thin mattresses on the floor, ate at a cracked plastic table and sat in chairs shorn of their backs. Large blue tubs overflowed with water used for bathing and flushing. There were small comforts — a television, a microwave and an electric keyboard on which the sicario taught himself to play the theme song to the movie “Titanic.” And every weekday, the makeshift wing of the prison turned into an evangelical revival. A pastor strummed an old guitar and led them in hymns. When the singing stopped, they took turns confessing — the soulless acts of violence they had committed, their temptation to return, their gratitude for having been saved. “Sixteen years ago, I was like you boys,” the pastor said, the guitar resting against his belly. “It’s a miracle I survived.” Several began to cry unprompted.  The sicario, whose crimes far exceeded those of the others, was the natural leader. He became a parental figure for the group, and enforced his will by wielding a large wooden stick.  Eventually, the young men earned the trust of their wardens, and were allowed an almost comic level of autonomy. By early 2019, they were running their own security, locking and unlocking the barred entry for visitors, monitoring comings and goings in the ward. A few even started their own business, washing the government cars in the lot. The police knew the risks were big, as was the possibility of failure. But their confidence grew by the day. Mr. Capella, the police chief, boasted of the change the sicario’s testimony had made on the streets. One deputy said the sicario would walk free with a clean rap sheet. “We have achieved what we set out to achieve,” Mr. Capella said.  The unwinding came sooner than expected. More than a year into the program, Mr. Capella got a new job as police chief in the state of Quintana Roo. Home to the neon hum of Cancún and boho-chic of Tulum, it was a much bigger post than Morelos. With his departure, the witness protection program lost its steward. It was expensive, and off the books. No one wanted to oversee someone else’s pet project. The young men continued to attend their court dates, the pastor kept turning up and the sicario’s girlfriend gave birth to their second child, a girl. But the energy of even a few months earlier began to vanish.  Nearly half of the witnesses were gone. Some had finished their court appearances and left of their own volition. Others had skipped out, content to risk the death sentence that awaited them on the street. Many had grown accustomed to the idea of an early death. To them, the program was a brief respite. The sicario talked less about what came next. Before, he practically counted the days until his departure. Now he merely shrugged when asked. In truth, he had grown used to the facility. He liked the respect from the guards, the prosecutors and his fellow witnesses. It was a sanctuary from the outside world, which frightened him. Not only did he worry about the cartel and a life on the run, but he also feared the temptation — that for all his talk of change, he would wind up right back where he started. “I know that being released and forming part of society again is harder than being locked up in here,” he said after a prayer session. “The truth is, I’d rather be in here, in pain, for 10 years than out there on my own.”  By the summer of 2019, the program was in rank disrepair — dirty dishes piled up, water pooled on the floor, toilets were left uncleaned. The lights didn’t even function properly anymore. “Everything is coming to an end,” he said one day. “Just take a look around you. The world is upside down.” He was practically alone now. Only one other witness remained. His friends came by periodically, to smoke weed or listen to music in the dark. He used them to ferry messages to people on the outside, including drug dealers. The police had all but abandoned the program. Most officials were happy to see it empty out, eager to be done with the burden.  In the void, the sicario returned to what he knew: selling drugs. While still inside, he recruited former witnesses who had left the program, forming a team of marijuana dealers from the same youth he had once vowed to rescue.  The pastor found out and pressed him to stop. “I realized how many people I was dragging to their doom again,” the sicario said. “I led my friends toward the Bible, and now I’m making them sell drugs.” His relapse seemed almost inevitable. How could the state expect to change someone so stripped of his humanity in just two years, with an unpaid, uneducated pastor as his only source of inspiration? Perhaps it never intended to. The sicario had helped dismantle his former cartel, leaving it in shambles. He was no longer of much use to the police.  On the outside, his enemies would see him as weak, no longer under the protection of the police. He liked to claim that his reputation on the streets kept his family safe, but that wasn’t entirely true, either. Even the police knew as much. The sicario had softened since joining the program. He cared about his family, his children, the prospect of a new life. Hope was a liability in his old world. One of the police officers had warned him about leaving. “‘You won’t stand a chance out there,’” he recalled the officer saying. “‘You aren’t the same person anymore.’” “He got it right,” the sicario said. “It’s true.” On a sunny afternoon in August, the sicario fled. A tipster warned him that the police were planning to arrest him and bring charges. True or not, he didn’t take the chance. He had been careless before, when he was caught the first time. But now, after all the people he had helped lock up, going to prison for real — with inmates, not cooperating witnesses — would mean certain death. He would be killed the moment he entered. He slipped out of the facility and checked into a small roadside hotel. After nearly two years under police protection, he was on his own.  A few days later, on Aug. 5, a pair of gunmen posing as customers came to his parents’ taco stand and shot his brother four times. As the killers fled, they left a note: “Let’s see if you all learn this way.” The brothers looked alike, so the gunmen may have thought they had killed the sicario. When he found out about the shooting, he wished they had. His brother was innocent, the family insisted. He had never associated with organized crime, on the sicario’s orders. He finished high school, lived at home with his parents, had enlisted to join the Mexican armed forces and was scheduled to head out soon, his mother said. The sicario knew he didn’t deserve freedom. “Justice for me,” he sometimes said, “would be death.” But his brother was different. “They hit me where it hurt most,” the sicario said, crying, not long after the murder. “The thing I loved most in the world, they took from me.” Still, he insisted that he would not seek revenge. Nothing would change because of it. His brother would still be dead. The killings would continue, even escalate, sucking in the rest of his family, in the kind of unending cycle Mexico itself is trapped in. Murder was inevitable, he said. His involvement didn’t have to be. “This will never end, no matter what I do,” he said. “But I just won’t be a part of it anymore.” ']",
"After Election Victory, Boris Johnson Says ‘We Are Going to Unite’",2019-12-13,,"[""Brexit will happen, Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed as he started his postelection era, adding that improving public health care was the nation’s top priority. “We will get Brexit done on time on the 31st of January — no ifs, no buts, no maybes,” Mr. Johnson told a gathering of his supporters early Friday morning.  Hours later, after being formally asked by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government, Mr. Johnson made the traditional speech to the nation outside 10 Downing Street, beginning with a claim that Conservatives had “an overwhelming mandate from this election to get Brexit done.” But he followed with a pitch that Labour politicians had made the core of their campaign: The government must improve the cherished but much-diminished National Health Service. “The overwhelming priority of British people right now is that we should focus above all on the N.H.S.” he said. Labour candidates had warned that the Conservatives would harm care by privatizing parts of the health service and striking a trade deal with President Trump that would raise drug prices.  Mr. Johnson repeated his big-spending campaign promises to hire thousands of doctors and tens of thousands of nurses and police officers, to build new hospitals, and create “better infrastructure, better education, better technology.” Striking a conciliatory tone, he said, “we are going to unite and level up” all parts of the country. He acknowledged that Conservatives had won over areas and voters that were long hostile to them and remained wary. “Thank you for the trust you have placed in us, and in me, and we will work around the clock to repay your trust and deliver on your priorities,” he said. With all districts declared,  Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives had won 365 seats — 48 more than they won in the last election, in 2017. The victory is the party’s biggest since Margaret Thatcher captured a third term in 1987 — “literally before many of you were born,” Mr. Johnson told supporters Friday morning. It gives him a comfortable majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. “We did it,” he said on Friday. “We smashed it, didn’t we?” Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party had to reach even farther back to find a more extreme result. It won 203 seats, down 59 from the previous vote, in its worst showing since 1935. It had not suffered a similar drubbing since 1983, when it took 209 seats. The Scottish National Party captured 48 of Scotland’s 59 seats, a gain of 13. The Liberal Democrats, who were hoping to ride an anti-Brexit stance back to prominence, won just 11 seats, one fewer than in 2017. The Conservatives collected 43.6 percent of the popular vote, to 32.2 percent for Labour. That 11.3 percentage point margin was also the largest for the Tories since 1987 — a dramatic shift from 2017, when Labour lost the popular vote by just 2.4 percent. The Scottish National Party’s success immediately intensified the debate over independence for Scotland, which voted against Brexit and has largely rejected Britain’s major parties. Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the party and the Scottish government, said on Friday that in the next week her administration would publish its plan for holding an independence referendum, which the Conservatives oppose. In a 2014 referendum, 45 percent of Scottish voters backed independence. “Scotland has rejected Boris Johnson and the Tories. and yet again we have said no to Brexit,” she said at a news conference. “I accept, regretfully, that he has a mandate for Brexit in England,” she added. “But he has no mandate whatsoever to take Scotland out of the European Union.” A referendum held by Scotland, but not recognized by the government in London, would raise the prospect of the kind of anger and disarray plaguing Spain. There, the government of Catalonia held an independence referendum two years ago that the central government said was illegal.  The Scottish people — not Mr. Johnson — must decide Scotland’s future, Ms. Sturgeon said. “It is clear beyond any doubt that the kind of future desired by the majority in Scotland is very different to that chosen by much of the rest of the U.K.,” she said.   Quim Torra, the separatist leader of Catalonia, congratulated Ms. Sturgeon on Twitter for “magnificent results that demonstrate the democratic will for independence.”  Politicians in Madrid have repeatedly rejected separatist comparisons to Scotland, arguing that Spain’s Constitution guarantees that sovereignty resides with the entire Spanish people. Speaking in his constituency of Islington in London, the Labour Party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said that he would step down before the next general election, but that he would stay at the party’s helm for now, as it reflects on how to move forward from its dismal showing. Mr. Corbyn is under intense pressure to resign. His has been accused of poor leadership and of failing to handle accusations of anti-Semitism in the party ranks. “I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign,” he said. “I will discuss with our party to ensure there is a process now of reflection on this result and on the policies that the party will take going forward, and I will lead the party during that period to ensure that discussion takes place and we move on into the future.” It was not clear how long Mr. Corbyn intends to stay on as party leader. The next election could be as long as five years away. Some Labour Party members were quick to criticize him on Thursday night. “The Labour Party has huge, huge questions to answer,” Ruth Smeeth, a former lawmaker, told Sky News. She immediately laid blame on Mr. Corbyn.  “Jeremy Corbyn should announce that he’s resigning as the leader of the Labour Party from his count today,” she said. “He should have gone many, many, many months ago.” The pound jumped in value on Thursday night, buoyed by the receding prospect of a chaotic exit from the European Union without a divorce agreement. It began Friday near $1.35, up from about $1.32 a day earlier, but gave back most of that gain by late afternoon. Equity markets were similarly lifted by the broad Conservative victory, with the FTSE 250 up more than 4 percent. The FTSE 100, which includes companies that rely more heavily on overseas earnings that would be dampened by a stronger pound, rose less sharply. If the Conservatives manage to pass the withdrawal agreement bill as planned, the gains are likely to hold up through the end of the year, said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. Easing global trade tensions should support markets too, after the United States and China, which have been locked in a trade war, settled on a partial deal. Prospects look more uncertain for the new year. The current deadline gives the British government has just 11 months to negotiate a complex deal on its long-term trading relationship with the European Union. The two sides may struggle to meet the Dec. 31, 2020 deadline, once again raising the prospect of a damaging “no-deal” Brexit. “If negotiators get stuck or bogged down or become more fractious, there’s a prospect of more volatility in the currency,” Mr. Dixon said. “The risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit might keep the market on their toes.” In the longer term, bond yields could also start to edge up if the Scottish secessionist movement gains momentum now that the Scottish National Party has won most of the seats in Scotland. “The one thing which certain investors, maybe bond market investors, will look at again is the integrity of the U.K. following the strong Scottish result for the S.N.P.,” Mr. Dixon added. European leaders on Friday welcomed the clarity of the British election result, which came during the last day of their summit meeting in Brussels, in hopes that it would make way for resolution of the Brexit deal.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson now has the majority needed to ratify his withdrawal agreement with Brussels by the Jan. 31 deadline laid out by Europe. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, congratulated Mr. Johnson on Twitter and said that he expected Britain’s Parliament to vote on the deal “as soon as possible.” But that will only start the clock on new negotiations about Britain’s future trading and security relationship with the bloc. Mr. Johnson has said that the process will be quick and easy, but few experts agree. It can be quick, Brussels argues, only if Britain agrees to keep its regulations and tariffs very close to those of the European Union. European leaders remain unsure whether Mr. Johnson will stick to his campaign pledge to finish any trade negotiation with the European Union by the end of 2020, or choose next summer to seek a year’s delay for longer talks. As long as they are negotiating, Britain is in a “transition” period, and its relationship with the European Union is essentially unchanged, even if it will be legally out of the bloc. Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg’s prime minister, said he hoped that Mr. Johnson would deliver on his campaign promises, as “people need to have clarity.” “I hope that with yesterday’s results, they do,” he said. “The excuse that there is no clear majority in London doesn’t last anymore.” But talks on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union are “not going to be simple,’’ he said. The Conservatives’ resounding win surprised many residents of Kensington, an area of West London that swung from Labour control for the last two years back to its longstanding Tory roots. Most of them seemed to accept Boris Johnson as the lesser evil in an election that presented them with limited options. “I was expecting a hung Parliament,” Brian Thompson, 71, said while walking Florence, a black Giant Schnauzer, just off Kensington High Street on Friday morning. Though not impressed with Mr. Johnson, he called the prime minister “the best out of a poor bunch.” The race for the Kensington seat was one of the closest in the country, as it was in 2017, but the share of the vote going to the two main parties fell sharply. Sebastian Gibson, 43, said he could not stomach either of them, and knew there would be no happy result for him. Mr. Gibson, a property buyer who voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union, voted on Thursday for the Liberal Democrats, who are anti-Brexit. “It’s sad for the country,” he said of the election. Mollie Lotery, 73, said she did not particularly like Mr. Johnson, but saw no real alternative. “I don’t like Labour because I’m Jewish,” she said, in reference to numerous anti-Semitism accusations against the party. “I am delighted at the result.”  “We were excited to watch the election results, but this is bad,” said Mina Aden, 29, a community worker from Ethiopia. “We were expecting Labour would still have Kensington. The Conservatives have never done anything for human rights.” Britain’s businesses welcomed the strong result for the Conservatives and the Brexit certainty that it is expected to bring, at least for now. But they remain fearful of facing another Brexit deadline at the end of next year. “The starting point must be rebuilding business confidence, and early reassurance on Brexit will be vital,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, the country’s biggest business association. Parts of the economy have been in limbo for much of the past three years, as negotiations with the European Union dragged on and Parliament was unable to muster majority support for any one approach. Both the Conservatives and Labour have worried the business community at different points. Labour had promised to nationalize some industries, while Boris Johnson unnerved businesspeople with his determination to plow on with leaving the European Union, even without an agreement. Now, companies want to know that they won’t be staring down another potentially disastrous deadline. “Firms will continue to do all they can to prepare for Brexit, but will want to know they won’t face another no deal cliff-edge next year,” Ms. Fairbairn said. And while the decisive victory paves the way for the next step in the Brexit process, one thing is clear: The postwar push toward greater global economic integration is fading. The British election verdict is not the only sign. In the United States, President Trump’s political base has rallied to his trade war against China. Popular movements across Europe have embraced nationalist and nativist causes that promise to halt globalization.  And the traditional arbiter of trade disputes, the World Trade Organization, is listing toward irrelevance.  “The era of freewheeling markets and liberalism is ending,” said Meredith Crowley, an international trade expert at the University of Cambridge in England.  Britain will have a record number of female members of Parliament after Thursday’s vote, when women won at least 220 of the 650 seats, according to the Press Association. At just over one-third of the House of Commons, women remain far short of parity with men, but they have made tremendous gains since the mid-1980s, when there were only 23 in Parliament. In the last general election, in 2017, women won 211 seats, a record at the time. This year’s increase comes at a time when many people feared that women were being driven away from politics in a climate of heightened divisions. Online threats and abuse have risen sharply and were disproportionately directed at female candidates. Ahead of the campaign, more than a dozen prominent female lawmakers said they would not stand for re-election citing that abuse as a reason for stepping away from politics.  Many female candidates described threats and insults as a grim new reality on the campaign trail, a change that cast a harsh light on British politics. An analysis of Twitter during the campaign, conducted by PoliMonitor, showed that all candidates received about four times as much abuse as in the 2017 election. The hostility aimed at women, the study said, was often based specifically on their sex or appearance.

"After Volcano Blast, New Zealand Asks if Adventure Tourism Can Last",2019-12-15,By Jamie Tarabay,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — When Phil van Dusschoten retired as a police officer and started a diving business 24 years ago, the next chapter of his life seemed set, steering visitors through the stunning Bay of Plenty to frolic with dolphins and swim around the volcanic White Island. That life and livelihood have been on pause since an eruption last Monday fired toxic gas and molten rocks into the air and engulfed the island in ash. Eight people died on the island and another eight have since succumbed to their wounds. Two others remain missing. Now the country is wondering about the economic aftershocks.  “People come to New Zealand because they expect to be challenged like this, to see if you have the nerve to step outside your comfort zone,” Mr. van Dusschoten said. “We hope that doesn’t go away.” The tragedy has set off an intense debate among New Zealanders about tourism, including whether nature is being wrongly exploited for thrills and whether enough precautions are being taken.  Many wonder whether the disaster will ruin adventure tourism for New Zealand. The country has a famed marketing campaign, “100% Pure New Zealand,” which includes ads filled with people rappelling down cliffs, helicopter snowboarding and white-water rafting — but also has a legal system that makes it hard to sue when things go wrong. The concerns echo those in other nations where tourism can be lucrative but treacherous. Nepal considered new safety rules for Mount Everest this year after one of its deadliest climbing seasons ever, and as more visitors flock to sites like Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan, the authorities are facing more questions about the safety of so-called dark tourism. New Zealand has much at stake. Tourism is the country’s biggest export, representing nearly 6 percent of its economic output, roughly double the industry’s share of the economies of Australia and the United States.  And the business is booming. In a country where growth is hard to find, tourism revenue has soared 50 percent over the past six years, according to government figures. The industry directly or indirectly employs more than 14 percent of the work force, providing 393,279 jobs last year. The people of Whakatane, the town closest to White Island, have been processing Monday’s explosion with shock, anger and fear.  Radio stations heard from callers who recounted stories of their riskiest trips and complained that more regulation would turn New Zealand into a nanny state. Employees in outdoor equipment stores worried that with White Island temporarily off limits, tourists would stop coming. Some residents accused tour operators of putting profits before safety, suggesting that they had ignored warnings about increased seismic activity.    Whakatane has no jurisdiction over the island, which is privately owned and comes under the mandate of New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs. But their fates are inextricably intertwined. Mayor Judy Turner called the island the “anchor” of the town, saying in an interview, “It is still the backbone of our economy, and there would be an impact if it’s closed to the public.”  A sudden drop in overseas visitors is not her greatest concern. Around 80 percent of tourism to Whakatane is domestic, she said, suggesting that interest will not disappear. “It’s a place where New Zealanders come for a holiday,” she said. Along the Bay of Plenty, with the volcano visible in the far distance, sits the local marae, the communal meeting place for Whakatane’s Maori people. The Ngati Awa tribe lives here, and even with people of its own missing on the island this past week allowed foreign families with lost loved ones onto its sacred ground.  One tribal leader, Pouroto Ngaropo, said the explosion was the island’s response to being exploited for money. “I think she’s had enough of tourism,” he said of Whakaari, the Maori name for White Island. “They make millions off her a year, that’s the real issue. People have lost sight of the meaning of nature and its beauty, he said, and are focused on shallow experiences.  “If we don’t listen, and then it keeps occurring, then what?” he said. “At least I can say I gave my message, and if anyone continues on the same path and others keep dying, I’ve told you so. Not me, she did.” The tribe has placed a spiritual ban on the island and its surrounding waters, barring any fishing or maritime activity until the dead are accounted for.  White Island’s owners, three brothers who inherited the volcano after it was bought in 1936 by an Auckland stockbroker named George Raymond Buttle, issued a statement asking that the spiritual ban, or rahui, be respected. With the two people still missing, it seems likely to stay in place.  The police on Sunday confirmed the deaths of two brothers — Matthew Robert Hollander, 13, and Berend Lawrence Hollander, 16, United States citizens who lived in Australia —\xa0and of Karla Michelle Mathews, 32, of Australia, in the eruption.  They have also named as among the dead four Australians —\xa0Krystal Eve Browitt, 21, Zoe Ella Hosking, 15, and Gavin Brian Dallow, 53, and Anthony James Landford, 51 — and a New Zealander, Tipene Maangi, 24. Maintaining a moratorium on tourism on White Island for any stretch of time could prove difficult. It has been featured for years along with other destinations in the country’s adventure tourism marketing. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who faces elections next year, has been vague about whether that approach to tourism needs to change and whether the volcano should be off limits. “We hear, and we absolutely agree, that there are questions that have been asked and must be answered,” she said on Friday. She also noted that White Island was a “volcano that’s been visited for the better part of 30 years” without serious misfortune. New Zealand’s legal system encourages a culture of risk-taking, experts say. It has a “no fault” framework that bars personal injury lawsuits in favor of a government compensation process for accidents, largely protecting businesses from the threat of large payouts.  “We have no court cases now for negligence or injury from motor vehicles, aircraft crashes, hot coffee, slipping over,” said Tim Mackenzie, a health and safety lawyer in Christchurch. People can sue for damages, he said, “but it is a very high test, rarely if ever met.” In Whakatane, many argue that a dash of danger is what people want. Even as boat rides, helicopter jaunts and other outdoor activities were suspended, Mr. van Dusschoten said he and other tour operators had fielded calls all week from people around the world who still wanted to visit. One woman, he said, conveyed that she had visited volcanoes in Hawaii and wanted to get close to White Island “to feel the fury.”  Mr. van Dusschoten insisted, as did many other New Zealanders, that what happened on Monday was unpredictable, the first natural catastrophe of its magnitude in decades of adventure tourism. The last time anyone died on White Island was in 1914 when part of a crater wall collapsed, killing 10 miners. Danger is part and parcel of New Zealand’s attraction, he said. “We do white-water rafting — there are places here you can go off a waterfall. Thousands of people do it, and you might have a drowning or two,” he said. “People walk on a glacier that could collapse at any time.”  Mr. van Dusschoten added, “It’s all risky stuff, but honestly, that’s what a lot of tourists demand these days, especially the young ones.”  Damien Cave contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia, and Sasha Borissenko from Auckland, New Zealand.

He Wanted to Be Pope. He Settled for Conducting the Metropolitan Opera.,2019-12-13,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — When the conductor \u200b\u200bYannick Nézet-Séguin was 10, he went to the basement of the family house, put on one of his parents’ vinyl records, held a yellow pencil aloft and began to conduct the first movement of Mozart’s Symphony No. 40, over and over again. For the previous four years, the boy, obsessed by the rituals and pageantry of the Roman Catholic Church, had gone to the basement every day to conduct Mass by himself, earnestly telling his parents he wanted to become pope. So when he went upstairs to announce his new vocation, his mother and father, engaged in a game of after-dinner bridge, were \u200bamused. “I was abnormally intense,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin, now 44, said with a laugh in between rehearsals at the Place des Arts concert hall in Montreal. “At that moment, my fascination with reli\u200bg\u200bion was transferred to music and the liturgical aspect of the church became the ritual of the concert. My parents said, ‘Oh, whatever. In two weeks, you’ll want to become an astronaut.’ But I never changed my mind.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who sometimes bleaches his short-cropped hair a vivid blond, has not disappointed his 10-year-old self. Last year, he became the third official music director in the history of the Metropolitan Opera in New York (“I expected his ‘Traviata’ to be good, but not this good,” wrote The Times’s chief classical music critic of the first opera that Mr. Nézet-Séguin conducted in his new post). Mr. Nézet-Séguin is also music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and conductor-for-life at the Montreal-based Orchestre Métropolitain. The triple role can be punishing for Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who shuttles frequently between the three cities and to recording sessions and about 120 concerts a year. But the indefatigable maestro, who communes with classical music scores even while in the bathtub, said that he also required solitude. He decompresses by swimming, listening to the French diva Dalida and drinking champagne. “Yes, I am very busy and high energy, but I am not hyperactive,” he said, switching seamlessly between French and English. “The loneliness of studying a score is one of the things that attracted me to becoming a conductor.”  Mr. Nézet-Séguin retains a deep affection and loyalty for his hometown, Montreal, where he got his start. At 21, he conducted Bach’s “St. John Passion” in a former church. It was his first public concert with a choir and instruments. He was so overcome, he said, that he could feel himself floating up to the chapel’s ceiling. “I felt as if I was levitating,” he recalled. More than two decades later, he appeared similarly elated when his Orchestre Métropolitain, long in the shadow of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, premiered at Carnegie Hall on a recent evening. When the audience erupted in a standing ovation after a haunting performance of Anton Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony, his eyes moistened with emotion.  For years, there was speculation that, as his stature soared, he would abandon the Montreal orchestra, which he began conducting at age 25. But Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he was determined to remain connected to his Quebec roots and to an orchestra he calls “my family,” in which his partner, Pierre Tourville, plays viola. Mr. Nézet-Séguin cites his native Quebec as a reason for his informal and egalitarian conducting style. “Our ancestors are mostly peasants and farmers, and there has long been a distrust of authority,” he said.  A mixture of decisiveness and gentle cajoling was on display in a recent rehearsal of the Orchestre Métropolitain for a performance of Berlioz’s “Harold in Italy.” Wearing sweatpants, a black T-shirt and running shoes, he used his whole body to express the music’s sweep, rising up and down on his toes on the podium with balletic athleticism.  “Too fast,” he told the brass section at one point. He sang out how he wanted the phrasing. He addressed all the players and not just the principal musicians. “Let’s return to that musical orgy part,” he said during a pause, eliciting laughter from the musicians, who addressed him as “Yannick.” Finally satisfied, he gave two thumbs up. Mr. Nézet-Séguin says he believes that conducting has too often been dominated by black-tailed deities. “The aim of my conducting is to elicit emotions from my players,” he said. “Being demanding is not the same thing as making people afraid.” Jean Paquin, a French horn player at the Orchestre Métropolitain who has known Mr. Nézet-Séguin for two decades, said that when the conductor arrived at age 25, some players had been skeptical. But Mr. Nézet-Séguin quickly convinced the doubters with his humility, his passion for the music and his “expressive, supernatural left hand,” Mr. Paquin said. Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he had always admired Leonard Bernstein, “primarily because there was never a note that was not filled with intention or emotion.” Then there was his “maestro,” the Italian conductor Carlo Maria Giulini, whose music Mr. Nézet-Séguin discovered as a boy before studying with him in the late 1990s. “He was very calm and never used harsh words,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. He added that he was determined to bring such equanimity to the Metropolitan Opera after “troubled times.” In 2018, Mr. Nézet-Séguin became the Met’s music director after the previous holder of the role, James Levine, was fired over allegations of sexual abuse that he denied. Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s aim for the Met, he said, was a new era of optimism through a “quiet revolution,” an allusion to a 1960s social movement in Quebec against the strictures of the Catholic Church. “I don’t believe in arriving at an institution and being a disrupter,” he said. “There is some resistance — I am not saying it’s always easy — but smiles and optimism are what is needed.” Born in Montreal into a churchgoing family, Mr. Nézet-Séguin gave credit to his parents, both professors of education, for accepting their gay son and for giving him the confidence to be himself, on and off the podium.  His parents, in an interview in New York, said he was a born performer, putting on musical shows for his two elder sisters, dancing to Michael Jackson hits and constantly drawing. At age 12, he began studying piano, composition and chamber music at the Conservatoire de Musique in Montreal, before founding his own orchestra and Baroque choir, La Chapelle de Montréal. “I never really properly studied conducting. I developed as a musician and eventually conducting became an extension of that,” he said. His father, Serge Séguin, said that when his son was 15, he had persuaded him to pay 600 Canadian dollars, about $520 at the time, to go to Montreal’s towering Courthouse and add his mother’s maiden name, Nézet, to his surname. Séguin is a common name in Quebec, and the teenager thought that a double-barreled name would help him stand out as an artist. “He had a vision of what was necessary to accomplish his ambitions,” Mr. Séguin said. “At that age, he was already thinking of his future on the global stage.” In 2000, Mr. Nézet-Séguin became conductor of the Orchestre Métropolitain. He recalled that when Mr. Tourville, his partner, had tried out for the ensemble from behind a curtain, he had recognized his viola playing immediately. “It was the warmth,” he said. The two met as students at the Conservatoire and Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who had a girlfriend at the time, said the relationship had gradually blossomed. Being an openly gay conductor, he added, was still woefully rare. “I want to be a role model for young people,” he said. Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s big break as a conductor came in 2008 at the internationally celebrated Salzburg Festival, where he conducted Gounod’s “Romeo and Juliette Overture.” He was so nervous at one public dress rehearsal that he began by conducting the wrong piece, “The Flying Dutchman” by Wagner,  he said. But his performance turned out to be a triumph, propelling his international career and leading to appearances with the world’s greatest opera houses and orchestras. Conducting, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said, sometimes required embracing the unexpected. Once, at the end of a performance in Montreal of the Alban Berg opera “Wozzeck,” he recalled, a musician’s cellphone played a honky-tonk tune just as the opera was ending with a boy dancing with a hobby horse. “It matched the scene onstage so well that people said, ‘Oh my God, this is genius!’” he said. Too many of today’s conductors, he added, were too controlling. “The danger is to become too dry, too academic,” he said, “That the mind takes too much space compared to the heart.”']",The Quebec-born music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin has soared to the peak of his profession thanks to his precocious talent and a belief in “smiles and optimism.”
Smuggled Iranian Gas and a Predawn Dash Lead to Fiery Crash That Kills 13,2019-12-13,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least 13 people were killed in a fiery collision between a passenger bus and a pickup truck carrying smuggled Iranian gasoline early Friday in southwestern Pakistan, officials said. The deadly collision happened around 4 a.m. Friday in Killa Saifullah, a remote district in Baluchistan Province. “Thirteen people were burned to death in the collision. One person miraculously survived without any injuries,” Atiqur Rehman, the deputy commissioner of the district, said in a telephone interview. The official said it was raining and snowing around 2:30 a.m. on Friday when officials received information about the movement of four Datsun pickup trucks carrying smuggled Iranian gasoline in the district. “They were intercepted by law enforcing authorities, but one pickup truck managed to break through the security cordon,” he said. “Later, we learned that there had been an accident of a bus and the pickup truck.” The commuter bus was traveling from Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab Province to Quetta, Baluchistan’s provincial capital. Both vehicles caught fire and fell into a 10-foot ditch after the collision. Smuggled Iranian fuel is typically much less expensive than legally sold fuel in Pakistan, and Pakistani officials have long struggled to stamp out its sale. In Mr. Rehman’s district alone, the authorities confiscated 15,000 liters (about 4,000 gallons) of Iranian fuel just last month, he said.  The smugglers move late in the night, sometimes in small convoys of old pickup trucks filled with oil cans, he said. Despite being rich in natural resources, and the site of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese development projects, Baluchistan is one of the most troubled places in Pakistan. The security forces have used a heavy hand in fighting a long-running insurgency there, Islamist militant groups often target the Shiite minority population, and much of the Afghan Taliban leadership is still based in Quetta.  Officials say that smuggling has long been a factor in Baluchistan, aided by the province’s badland borders with Iran and Afghanistan, and driven by deep poverty and unemployment among residents.  “They are playing with fire only because they are very desperate,” Dr. Jehanzeb Jamaldini, a senator from Baluchistan Province, said of the poverty problem.  Senator Jamaldini said that the government had not done a good job providing alternative jobs and better economic conditions in Baluchistan, creating an opening for the sale of cheaper Iranian gasoline that should be allowed anyway to benefit residents.  But Pakistani officials say that smuggled Iranian fuel drains around $400 million from Pakistan’s economy each year.  An official of the Pakistan State Oil company told the country’s Senate this year that smuggled Iranian oil was still easily available in Quetta, the provincial capital, and elsewhere in the province.  “We have to shut down 159 petrol outlets in Baluchistan where Iranian petrol is freely available at fuel stations, and it is cheaper,” Umar Shafi, the official, was quoted as saying by the local news media. The smuggled gasoline also finds its way to other Pakistani provinces, including Sindh Province and the economic hub city of Karachi.']","In remote Pakistan, a fuel-loaded pickup that had evaded the police collided with a passenger bus around 4 a.m., officials say."
"On New Zealand’s Volcano, Knee-Deep Ash and Boiling Water Underfoot",2019-12-14,By Jamie Tarabay,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — The bodies were more than a quarter-mile from shore, some on higher ground, on a scorched, moonlike landscape shrouded in toxic gas. The troops had about three hours’ worth of oxygen, more than enough, they thought, to complete the mission.  But soon after setting foot on White Island, they knew they would need every second they could get.  Eight members of New Zealand’s special operations forces, six men and two women, on Friday managed to recover the bodies of six people killed in the eruption Monday on White Island, an active volcano that is also a tourist attraction. As of Saturday, two bodies were unaccounted for; at least one was believed to have been swept into a bay, and police divers were searching the contaminated waters.  The death toll officially stood at 15, not counting the two missing bodies. Many of the dozens of surviving victims were still in emergency care, some with burns covering 95 percent of their bodies, according to doctors. On Saturday, the police formally identified one of the dead as Krystal Eve Browitt, 21, of Australia. The daunting conditions faced by the recovery team on Friday underscored the sheer power of the initial eruption — which blasted rocks and sulfurous debris into the sky, filled the air with acidic gas and smothered the island with layers of ash — and again raised the question of why tourists had been allowed onto the island despite a recent rise in volcanic activity.  The authorities had held off for days on sending the team to White Island, also known by its Maori name, Whakaari, because experts said it could erupt again at any time. But they moved ahead with the mission on Friday, recognizing the need to bring peace to the victims’ loved ones. Even as the team was trekking through sludge-like ash, the odds of an eruption stood at 50 percent to 60 percent, according to volcanologists.  The troops landed on the island at 8 a.m., said their on-the-ground commander, who was made available to discuss the operation with reporters on the condition that his identity not be disclosed.  A sentry was monitoring the volcano for signs of change in its activity, and teams on boats anchored nearby were in a state of alert, ready for a sudden evacuation. A backup crew of special operations forces, wearing the same protective gear as the team on the ground, was in a rubber dinghy on standby. The recovery team wore three layers of protective clothing and carried 33-pound rebreathing apparatuses on their backs, with oxygen cylinders. Their helmets soon became saunas, and their bodies were drenched in sweat. They knew where to go, since the bodies had been identified from the air. But the terrain was unlike anything they had experienced before, and the mission went on for hours.  Most chemical and biological warfare training takes place in urban environments or industrial areas, and certainly not on volcanic ground, the on-the-ground commander noted. Midway through the search, the team went back to the jetty to rehydrate. “The troops on the ground could feel the volcano rumbling underneath them,” said Col. Rian McKinstry, who oversaw the operation remotely. Where the ground was soft — next to a stream, for example — they could feel the water boiling underneath the soil. “It would be like wearing an oven mitt and holding a hot tray,” Colonel McKinstry said. “You could feel the heat, even as you’re protected from it.” It took two hours for the troops to collect the six bodies, trudging through knee-deep sludge, drawing labored breaths and constantly thinking about the volcano rumbling over their shoulders. After bringing those bodies out, the team spent an hour searching for the other two. But the aerial images showing their possible locations had not conveyed just how much sediment and ash covered the area, and they were unable to find them. Team members were forced to abandon the search before their air ran out. The mission ended three and a half hours after it began. Team members were dehydrated and vomiting. The worst possibility, an eruption, had not happened, but the effects of being so close to the boiling, gaseous core lingered well after they left its shore.  “They’ve gone to the depths of their endurance and past it,” Colonel McKinstry said. “They wouldn’t say it, but it was obvious to me as their boss.” Elian Peltier contributed reporting from London.']","The team that recovered bodies from White Island went “to the depths of their endurance and past it,” said the colonel who oversaw the mission."
"On Your Tables: Ginger Beef, Caesars and Butter Tarts",2019-12-13,,"['By Ian Austen Readers of The Canada Letter were keen to highlight the contributions by their communities and provinces to Canadian cuisine after I presented my inadequate and incomplete list a couple of weeks ago. Among your many emails, one came from Jacqueline Fobes, a reader from Pebble Beach, Calf., alerting me to a terrific book about this very topic: “Speaking in Cod Tongues.” After giving it a read, I called Lenore Newman, its author and the Canada research chairwoman in food security and environment at the University of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. Professor Newman told me she was inspired to cross the country looking for sources of local food pride by a student “who became obsessed” with Nanaimo bars. She found some research money that, among other things, allowed the student to research whether the bars were actually from Nanaimo (they are). “That got me into the bigger story and of the role of women in the 1950s, their lives in mill towns and the cuisine they created,” Professor Newman told me. She defines Canadian cuisine in part by what it isn’t. “We don’t have a lot of recipes, and that’s a function of the nature of our cuisine,” she said. “It doesn’t mean it’s less developed. There’s lots of cuisines around the world that aren’t recipes. Instead, in Professor Newman’s view, Canadian cooking is “all about properties of seasonality, of incorporating wild foods, of multicultural incorporation and ingredients.” Several of you, too many to name, noted the absence of butter tarts from my list. That was a result of doubt and cowardice on my part. I planned to include butter tarts as one of Ontario’s contributions until I came across other provinces making claims on them. Professor Newman, however, assured me that they are indeed from Ontario.  If you didn’t catch it when it first appeared, be sure to read this defining take on butter tarts by Sara Bonisteel, my colleague in Cooking at The Times. [Read: The Passions of the Butter Tart] Marc LaPlante from Kingston, Ontario, and six other readers pointed out another missing item from Ontario. “Great Canucks, how can you not list the delight of the fried sweet BeaverTail  from the Ottawa Valley?” Mr. LaPlante wrote. Most commonly associated with skating on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, the BeaverTail is essentially flattened out doughnut pastry made with whole wheat flour and deep fried. The company that owns the name claims they were first sold by its founder, Grant Hooker, in Killaloe, Ontario, in 1978. Speaking for many parents, I’m sure, I have less than fond memories of trying to convince young children that not every skating excursion on the canal involved buying them. Ten readers brought up Calgary’s very important contribution: ginger beef. In her book, Professor Newman describes it as “deep fried strips of beef in a sweet sauce with fresh ginger, garlic, and hot pepper, usually with a few carrots and onions.” While it’s now a staple of most Chinese restaurants in Canada, Bill Corbett attributes its origins to the Silver Inn Restaurant.  He was also among several readers who raised Calgary’s creation of the Caesar. While that’s veering into beverage territory, it is an opportunity to bring up Robert Simonson’s article about how Canadians define the cocktail. [Read: It Came, It Quenched, It Conquered Canada: The Caesar] My mention of Vancouver and its Indian pizza prompted emails about two other variations on pizza. Cara Stewart reported that pirogi pizza can be found in Saskatchewan. I won’t render judgment until I’ve tried it next time I’m there. Bill Weaver pointed out that Hawaiian pizza — topped with ham and tinned pineapple — came out of Chatham, Ontario. “Although the topping creates some polarized views, I believe the addition of pineapple has advanced the taste of pizzas,” he wrote. Finally, several readers, including some of my friends, suggested that the peameal bacon sandwiches found at two stands in the St. Lawrence Market are the defining food of Toronto. But it seems a stretch to claim that they are to Toronto what bagels and smoked meat are to Montreal.  Professor Newman suggested it might be impossible to find a defining food for Toronto, a city of many foods. “I don’t think there’s ever going be a quintessential Toronto dish,” she told me, adding that the city is “just too global and multicultural.” \u200b\u200bYannick Nézet-Séguin, the musical director of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, told Dan Bilefsky that while growing up in Montreal, “I was abnormally intense.” Kawhi Leonard may now play for the Los Angeles Clippers, but the basketball crowd back in Toronto isn’t holding that against him. Sara Harowitz of Vancouver suggests five places to visit in the city’s Hastings-Sunrise district. Canada, the United States and Mexico agreed to a second version of the new NAFTA this week in a bid to get congressional approval in Washington. What benefits it will bring to autoworkers, however, is less clear. Boris Johnson won a resounding victory in Britain this week in an election that, like Canada’s, left the country divided politically along regional lines. The photographer Andrew Testa made a photographic portrait of the nation as it now faces Brexit. Like their Canadian counterparts, natural gas producers in the United States are hoping that exports of liquefied natural gas might reverse falling prices caused by a global glut of gas. Clifford Krauss’s reporting suggests that they both may be disappointed. Terry de Havilland, the British maker of psychedelic shoes for stars, has died at the age of 81. “I designed most of my shoes on acid, and the opening party for my shop in the King’s Road was famous for the three Cs — champagne, cocaine and caviar,” Mr. de Havilland once wrote. “God knows who was there — everybody.” Paintings on an Indonesian island that are at least 43,900 years old may be the oldest known art depicting scenes from the imagination.

Iran Says It Was Hit With ‘Very Big’ Cyberattack,2019-12-13,By Farnaz Fassihi and Ronen Bergman,"['Iran’s government has acknowledged that it faced a “very big” cyberattack, following a report in The New York Times this week that information from 15 million Iranian bank accounts was stolen and published online after widespread street protests were crushed in November. Iran’s telecommunication minister, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi — who had previously dismissed the bank-account theft as an insider extortion plot — said the attack had been state sponsored, but he offered no evidence to back up the claim. He said details and the country deemed responsible would be revealed after investigations had been completed.  Mr. Azari Jahromi said Iran’s cybersecurity unit had  thwarted the attack, making no direct mention of the compromised bank accounts. “We faced a very well-coordinated state-sponsored cyberattack on the government’s digital infrastructure,” Mr. Azari Jahromi told reporters in Tehran on Wednesday. “It was a very big attack.” He made the announcement the same day that Telegram, the popular phone app widely used in Iran, shut down the channel where the bank account details had been revealed for all to see.  The Telegram channel was created on Nov. 27 and until Dec. 5 had been home to the uploaded names and details for debit cards tied to the accounts of millions of Iranians who are clients of three banks — Mellat, Tejarat and Sarmayeh.  All three were the target of United States sanctions a year earlier over what American officials described as prohibited financial transfers done on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. “We routinely close down channels which publish personal data like passport scans or credit card numbers,” said Markus Ra, spokesman for Telegram. This channel was closed, he said, when a user reported it to the company after the publication of The Times article. A week earlier, Mr. Azari Jahromi had characterized the breaching of the bank accounts as the act of a disgruntled former contractor he said had obtained access to the information and was using it for extortion. As of Thursday, the banks had not issued a public statement about the breached accounts. But it appeared the problem continued even after the channel was erased from Telegram. Some Iranians posted screenshots of emails they had received from accounts with addresses identical to the customer service departments at two of the banks. The emails showed the account holders’ personal identification details and warned them: “We are in control of your bank information and your bank is lying to you.”  The emails advised these customers to take immediate action but did not specify what it should be. One Iranian said on Twitter that some of these emails contained an attachment file with the numbers of millions of leaked accounts. An Iranian cybersecurity expert based in New York, Amir Rashidi, said he had traced the emails to a server in Germany. Cybersecurity experts said that a breach of this magnitude could have been the work of a state actor, although there have been sophisticated attacks on Western banking systems that turned out to be organized by criminal groups.  They also said there was always the possibility that the attack had been the work of an insider.  Iranian media said the attack was the largest banking security breach in Iran’s history.  While there is constant cyberconflict between the United States and Iran, American financial institutions and the Federal Reserve have long been leery of offensive actions by the United States government against other countries’ financial systems. They fear that might legitimize reprisals against American accounts.  For Iran, the breach is the latest in a wave of challenges. In the past month, Iran announced it was facing a significant budget deficit because of American economic sanctions, it crushed nationwide demonstrations with a deadly response that has been widely criticized, and it contended with growing regional resentment. That is especially the case in Iraq, where Iran has exerted significant influence. Experts said that the bank breach, at the very least, could create a crisis of public trust with the country’s financial institutions. Boaz Dolev, chief executive of ClearSky, a cybersecurity company that was among the first outside Iran to spot the banking breach, said he believed the affected banks had deliberately kept quiet. Mr. Dolev speculated that the banks did not cancel the accounts “because they do not want to panic the public or they will find it very difficult to issue new cards.” In Israel — which, like the United States, has engaged in cyberconflict with Iran — news about the banking breach raised suspicions that Iran might blame Israel and take revenge. An Israeli banking official said two of the country’s biggest banks on Wednesday raised their cyberattack warnings to “top alert.”  A Middle Eastern intelligence official who tracks Iran and opposes its foreign policy said that over the past week top Iranian intelligence agencies, including the large cyberunit inside Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence, had been trying to track down the source of the banking breach and those behind the creation of the now-erased Telegram channel. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the security authorities in Iran were taking a serious stance on the breach and believe it had increased the potential for a renewed flare-up of antigovernment demonstrations, given the “damage to many citizens and the regime’s failure to prevent such information leaks.” David E. Sanger contributed reporting. ']",
Sudan’s Ousted Leader Is Sentenced to Two Years for Corruption,2019-12-14,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — For almost three decades, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir ruled Sudan with a heavy fist, jailing opponents and former allies, overseeing the bloody suppression of the Darfur region and squashing protests that dared to challenge his regime. But on Saturday, Mr. al-Bashir, 75, was convicted of money laundering and corruption and sentenced to two years in detention in a much-anticipated trial that was the first attempt by his own citizens to call him to account. Wearing the traditional Sudanese white jalabiya garment and turban, Mr. al-Bashir stepped into a packed court in central Khartoum and was corralled in a meshed metal defendant’s cage. Once a powerful strongman who ruled one of Africa’s biggest nations, he stood with his head bowed as the judge read the charges against him while several police officers stood around. The judge, citing his age, ordered him to serve his time in a correctional center for older prisoners.  As the judge read the verdict, his supporters started jeering and saying the case was “politicized,” forcing security officials to remove them from the court. Supporters also gathered in front of the court to protest the decision. Mr. al-Bashir was deposed in April after months of persistent demonstrations throughout the country convinced key military commanders to turn against him. When security forces searched his home and found suitcases stuffed with millions of euros, U.S. dollars, and Sudanese pounds, he was arrested and charged with possessing foreign currency, corruption and receiving illegal gifts.  But Mr. al-Bashir could face even more serious charges related to his alleged abuses of human rights: He has already been accused of ordering the killing of pro-democracy protesters earlier this year, and was called to court this month over his role in the coup that brought him to power in 1989.  He was indicted a decade ago on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, but the joint civilian-military cabinet that now governs Sudan — the result of months of delicate negotiations — has not so far agreed to have him extradited to face trial there.  Galal Yousif, a Sudanese artist who played a prominent role in the protests to oust Mr. al-Bashir, said the current court case against Mr. al-Bashir reflects the will of many people. The military on Friday announced heightened security measures and the closing of roads ahead of anticipated protests linked to the verdict. “Al-Bashir did a lot of crime in Sudan,” Mr. Yousif said. “I know he’s guilty and everyone knows that.” Yet trying Mr. al-Bashir only on corruption charges, and not for human-rights abuses, “doesn’t make sense,” Mr. Yousif said, and doesn’t amount to “real justice” for those he victimized. “No one is satisfied about that,” Mr. Yousif said. “The streets are awake and we are still in revolution.” Nevertheless, the trial marks a pivotal moment in the fraught democratic transition of Sudan, a large, strategic state that serves as a bridge between north and sub-Saharan Africa. By facing the law, Mr. al-Bashir joins a list of reputedly despotic leaders who have been removed from office through popular protests and who have been put on trial over their actions while in power. Mr. al-Bashir’s lawyers have argued that it is common for leaders to hold foreign currency. While Mr. al-Bashir has admitted to investigators that he received $90 million from Saudi royals, the current trial is about $25 million of those funds which he received from the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.  During the ruling on Saturday, one of Mr. al-Bashir’s lawyers told the judge that the trial was “political” and that the deposed leader never used “one single dollar for his own personal benefit.” One of his lawyers told reporters his client could appeal the verdict.  For many years, Mr. al-Bashir seemed untouchable. A guilty ruling in the corruption case helps “break this spell of immunity that has been pervasive” under Mr. al-Bashir and his ruling National Congress Party, said Jonas Horner, a Sudan expert with the International Crisis Group, a research organization. Following a career in the military, Mr. al-Bashir rose to power in a bloodless putsch in 1989. During his reign, Sudan was plagued by armed conflict and multiple economic shocks. Mr. al-Bashir gave refuge to Osama bin Laden years before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the United States listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism. But last December, protests triggered by the high price of bread, a symptom of an acute economic crisis, erupted in the northeastern city of Atbara, quickly spreading to major cities including Omdurman and the capital, Khartoum.  To subdue the uprising, authorities temporarily shut down the internet, arrested opposition figures and critical journalists, and used tear gas to disperse growing crowds that chanted, “The people want the fall of the regime.” Following months of tumultuous protests led by young Sudanese, doctors and other professionals, the military removed Mr. al-Bashir from office and arrested him on April 11, bringing to an end the rule of one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders.  Mr. al-Bashir was initially put under house arrest at his residence in the military headquarters, but was transferred to the Kober prison, where Mr. al-Bashir once jailed demonstrators and political prisoners. In mid-August, Sudan’s generals, along with the opposition alliance that grew out of the protest movement, reached a power-sharing agreement that promises to oversee elections and a return to civilian rule in three years. Abdalla Hamdok, an economist, was named prime minister, while Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan leads an 11-person sovereign council. The transitional government has undertaken steps to keep Sudan’s transition on track and fulfill major demands by pro-democracy protesters. Mr. Hamdok’s administration has disbanded the Congress Party, overturned morality laws that outlawed drinking and prohibited women from wearing clothes considered revealing, and convinced the Trump administration to send an ambassador to Khartoum for the first time in 23 years. Mr. Hamdok and his cabinet recently visited Washington in an effort to get Sudan removed from the Americans government’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that has crippled Sudan’s economy, limited foreign investment and restricted debt relief.  On Friday, the transitional government released 10 priorities that included fighting corruption and safeguarding human rights. Sentry, a watchdog group founded by the actor George Clooney and the rights activist John Prendergast, supported Sudan’s removal from the list this week, citing positive steps taken by the Hamdok administration. While the corruption trial against Mr. al-Bashir is crucial, many Sudanese worry that by trying him first on corruption, meaningful justice will not be delivered, said Mr. Horner, the Sudan expert. It wasn’t immediately clear if Mr. al-Bashir will be tried on human rights charges in Sudan. “The financial crimes are secondary for many Sudanese,” Mr. Horner said, especially for those who suffered in the brutal military campaign in the western region of Darfur, where as many as 300,000 people have been killed since 2003, according to United Nations estimates. “The main concern for Darfur and those in the peripheries in the south and west,” he said, “is to see him held accountable for crimes that are far more violent and damning.”']","Omar Hassan al-Bashir, accused of genocide in Darfur, was charged with possessing foreign currency and receiving illegal gifts.

"From Canada’s Legal High, a Business Letdown",2019-12-15,By Ian Austen,"['SMITHS FALLS, Ontario — When Canada became the first major industrialized nation to legalize recreational marijuana, visions of billions of dollars in profits inspired growers, retailers and investors, sending the stock market soaring in a so-called green rush. A year later, the euphoria has vanished.  “No one wants to invest in it now,” said John-Kurt Pliniussen, a professor of marketing at the Smith School of Business at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.  That is because those who have invested have generally lost money. During the first year after legalization, the value of shares in Canada’s six largest marijuana companies tumbled by an average of 56 percent, according to stock price data.  The marijuana companies say a turnaround is only a matter of time, hoping a big step along the way materialized on Dec. 16, when marijuana-laced drinks and foods arrived in the legal market. But the problems that plagued the first year remain. One is that the provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec, whose residents account for about two-thirds of Canada’s population, have opened or licensed legal pot shops at a glacial pace — despite a clear demand. Potential customers are still underserved with just 24 legal marijuana shops for Ontario’s 17.5 million residents. So many are still buying on the black market.  And freed from taxation, the black market is generally cheaper across the country. Another problem, many in the industry say, is that the elaborate regulatory structure for legal cannabis has been an impediment to sales. Canada’s regulations were designed only to decriminalize marijuana use, not necessarily encourage it. The result is a system that mimics the country’s approach to tobacco, and largely blocks marketing and advertising. “This last year has been very painful,” said Eric Kirzner, a professor emeritus of finance at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, who compared the fate of marijuana stocks to earlier technology share crashes. “Marijuana is hardly the technology industry, but to me the stories are similar in the sense that we had all kinds of hype.” Mr. Pliniussen doesn’t see the opening of the market to edibles as a turning point. “I expect this to be just like slow ripples on a pond as opposed to a tsunami of excitement,” he said. “What we have now is what we’re going to have — this is it.” Despite the crushing business disappointments, there has been a bright spot: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s experiment in legalizing cannabis has not turned Canada into a stoner nation, as was widely feared.  Marijuana-impaired motorists are not menacing the nation’s highways, and workers are not getting high on the job. There has not even been much change in marijuana use, except for a small rise among people over 65, according to Statistics Canada, the government census agency.  “It kind of fell flat,” said Professor Michael Amlung, a professor of psychiatry at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario who studies marijuana use. “The overwhelmingly expected response has not happened.” For the companies, the economic growing pains have been tough. Take Canopy Growth, the biggest Canadian grower. Canopy’s business has its headquarters in Smiths Falls, Ontario, once the home of Hershey Canada. A sprawling complex of marijuana growing and processing rooms replaced the assembly lines that once spat out thousands of chocolate bars and peanut butter cups each day.  These days, construction is booming at the plant, with new additions being built on either side of the former chocolate factory. Inside, along with the marijuana growing and processing rooms, chocolate making is back if on a vastly smaller scale and a new added ingredient. Across the street, technicians are doing the final tweaks to equipment inside a brand-new, 150,000 square foot bottling and canning plant that will soon make marijuana-infused drinks. But during the first six months of its current fiscal year, Canopy lost 1.6 billion Canadian dollars. Bruce Linton, the company’s founder, former chairman and chief executive who was once the industry’s de facto spokesman, was fired earlier this year.  Among its problems, Canopy struggled with converting greenhouses in British Columbia and Quebec that once grew vegetables into ones producing something to smoke. It built costly systems in Smiths Falls to turn lower quality plants into oil, only to find that Canadians overwhelming prefer to smoke the plants’ dried flower buds. And costs spiraled upward as it rushed to meet the new market’s demands.  Constellation Brands, the American company that is Canopy’s largest shareholder and also the owner of Corona beer and Robert Mondavi wine, has cut off further investment. It will install one of its executives in Mr. Linton’s former place next month.  Canopy’s shares, which hit 70 Canadian dollars during the lead up to legalization are now down by about 66 percent. Rade Kovacevic. Canopy’s president, is still optimistic.  “It’s been a very exciting ride,” said Mr. Kovacevic, despite the “short-term pain points.”  He added that the “more exciting part” will come as edibles and other products become more widely available. “We’re not a company that’s in this for the next three quarters, we’re a company that’s in this for next three decades,” said Mr. Kovacevic, who started in the industry as a lobbyist for medical marijuana dispensaries.  Variations of the Canopy scenario have played out at most of its major competitors. Some have suffered worse problems.  For example, the growing license of CannTrust Holdings was suspended after Health Canada, the federal regulator, learned that the company used a false wall to hide an illicit cultivation area from inspectors.  The company’s chief executive, a former banker, was fired, and the company is now under police investigation. Its stock is in danger of being removed from the TSX exchange in Toronto. A major problem for growers generally is that it’s still not easy for many Canadians to legally buy marijuana, particularly in Ontario.  Not long before legalization, a Conservative government took power in the province and swiftly canceled a plan by the Liberal government it replaced to sell through government-owned stores. But Professor Amlung said research showed that Canadians overwhelmingly preferred buying marijuana in stores. “Online they can’t actually see the product,” he said. “They can’t smell the product, a lot of those things that are part of purchasing cannabis.”  On Thursday, Ontario announced that it was lifting its limits on store licenses and will issue about 20 licenses monthly, starting in March 2020. But, for now, the lack of stores in Ontario, as well as in Quebec, help keep the black market afloat.  Surveys by Statistics Canada have found that only 28 percent of cannabis buyers meet all of their marijuana needs through legal sources. There is no legal marijuana shop in Smiths Falls; Canopy was not allowed to replace Hershey’s factory outlet with one of its own. But nearby in Ottawa, population 1 million, Mimi Lam, a former investment banker, owns one of three legal shops in the national capital. Strict marketing restrictions mean that passers-by can’t see into her store, Superette. But once customers pass through an I.D. check to prove that they are at least 19, they enter a shop that’s a pastiche of a 1950s diner — if one where marijuana buds sit in displays that would otherwise hold doughnuts and muffins. One recent evening, most shoppers leaving Ms. Lam’s shop, which is on the busy shopping street of an upper middle class neighborhood, declined to talk about their purchases.  One of the few people who would talk did so on the condition that she be identified only by her given name, Shauna. A university student, she said she feared using her full name might harm her employment prospects after graduation. She said there was still stigma attached to using marijuana, adding that she used it to focus while studying. She said she switched to Superette from the illegal market over concerns about the safety of street drugs. Unlike many people in Canada’s marijuana trade, Ms. Lam is making money although not as much as she had hoped. She said that for the industry to really succeed, the government needed to loosen regulations.  “This is a real opportunity for players in this country to really shine and show the rest of the world what we can do and push the boundaries of cannabis integration in society,” she said.  ']","Investors poured money into Canada’s marijuana market, but one year after legalization, the euphoria has evaporated. "
Mounting Evidence of Abuse by Chile’s Police Leads to Calls for Reform,2019-12-13,By Pascale Bonnefoy,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — The brutality of the Chilean police’s response to the country’s unrest  is leading to sweeping calls for the force’s reform. The protests, which started two months ago over an increase in subway fares and quickly morphed into a broader reckoning over inequality, included peaceful gatherings and violent confrontations with the police that resulted in thousands of instances of abuse, according to the National Institute for Human Rights, an autonomous state agency. Almost 400 of the incidents documented by the National Institute for Human Rights are of torture and cruel treatment. Another 194 involve sexual violence, including four rapes. More than 800 involve excessive use of force by the police. The Institute has labeled at least six killings by security forces as homicides. These documented instances of human rights violations have brought new scrutiny to the Carabineros, Chile’s national police force, which was never purged or significantly reformed after the dictatorship headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet ended in 1990. The Carabineros were deeply involved in human rights violations that left over 3,000 dead and disappeared and 38,000 tortured during Pinochet’s rule. “We never thought we would have to come back to Chile under these circumstances to record massive human rights violations,” said José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas’ director of Human Rights Watch, when the organization presented its report on Chile last month. “We thought this was history.” The Carabineros declined a request for an interview, but this week its director, Gen. Mario Rozas, said there were 856 internal investigations related to the reports underway. He also announced structural and policy changes to the institution.  President Sebastián Piñera said accusations will be investigated, and welcomed into the country four human rights organizations, including the Organization of American States and the United Nations, which found “a high number of serious human rights violations.” The government has also created a task force, led by Gonzalo Blumel, the interior minister, to propose reforms for the police force, and the police suspended the use of pellets. But human rights groups say that the Carabineros are still firing tear gas cartridges at demonstrators’ bodies and heads, in breach of their own protocol. On December 10, International Human Rights Day, 8 people were injured this way — two of them, including a 15-year-old girl, are in critical condition. Human rights groups and analysts say they want the government to increase its oversight of the Carabineros’s budget, operations and training and of their appointment and removal of officers, effectively bringing the police under civilian control.  Opposition legislators say the president bears responsibility for the actions of forces under his watch, and launched a process similar to impeachment proceedings against him and his former interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, who stepped down weeks after the protests began. The case against President Piñera was dismissed on Thursday. But on Wednesday, the Senate approved the accusations against Mr. Chadwick, holding him responsible for failing to take steps to avoid human rights violations and “not maintaining public order in a rational manner.” He was barred from holding any public office for five years. Since the protests began, hundreds of demonstrators have suffered eye injuries at the hands of the police, caused by the indiscriminate use of riot guns, often aimed directly at demonstrators’ heads. Two victims were blinded. More than 12,700 people have been wounded across the country, according to hospital records. The Public Prosecutor’s Office opened more than 2,670 criminal investigations based on reports of torture, sexual violence and injuries from firearms. The vast majority involve Carabineros personnel. When Chileans took to the streets in mid-October, the Carabineros were already facing a profound crisis, and were ill-prepared to be on the front lines of a sustained period of unrest. Over the past two years, more than 35 generals who were part of the Carabineros forces have been ousted in the wake of a series of scandals. Among those dismissed was the former police chief, who stepped down in 2018 after an anti-terrorist squad killed an indigenous man, Camilo Catrillanca, and then covered up the crime. Most of the senior officers removed were implicated in one of the biggest embezzlement scandals in Chilean history, a case that dragged on for more than a decade and involves at least $35 million. Nearly 100 police officers and civilians have been convicted to date in connection to the case, and the trial of 31 alleged ringleaders — a group that includes senior officers and former finance directors of the force — is scheduled to begin in a few months. The Carabineros’s intelligence division has also been in disarray after its agents came under investigation in connection with a scheme to fabricate evidence to falsely implicate members of the Mapuche indigenous community in terrorist activities in 2017. “All of this has generated significant internal conflict and discontent within their ranks, causing a legitimacy crisis that is both social and internal,” said political analyst Claudio Fuentes, a professor at Diego Portales University. Chile has seldom seen a period of unrest as prolonged and violent as the one that kicked off in mid-October. But signs of discontent had been brewing over the past decade: Large protests had taken place demanding education and pension reform, an end to corruption and respect for the land rights of indigenous people. And in every wave of protest, the police were accused of using disproportionate force — and of failing to credibly investigate and punish instances of abuses. Reforming the Carabineros was already on the legislative agenda when the protests broke out, but the proposed changes aim at improving transparency and fall short of the structural reforms needed to turn the police into a civilian force with robust accountability, which is what is being demanded now. Critics say the Carabineros have a hierarchical military structure and a system for disciplining officers that effectively discourage personnel from reporting misconduct or carrying out independent investigations. And the police often ignore the new use of force protocols they enacted in March, rights groups say. Bound by laws left behind by the Pinochet regime, Chile’s governments through the 1990s never had enough votes in Congress or the political sway to overhaul the Carabineros. Chilean authorities were unable to remove its high command, purge it of corrupt or abusive officers, or adapt its curriculum to a democratic scenario. “Carabineros is a militarized police force, with a military structure and logic, not a civil police force,” said Mr. Fuentes. “All attempts to reform it after dictatorship have been very slow, with very little capacity for civilian control.”']","Human rights monitors accuse the police of torture, sexual violence and other abuse, drawing scrutiny to Chile’s scandal-plagued national force."
"In Era of Hardening Identities, Trump Order on Jews Kindles Questions Old and New",2019-12-15,By Max Fisher,"['President Trump’s executive order targeting anti-Semitic and anti-Israel speech on campuses might be framed as a narrow legal matter, but it has touched on a defining issue of our time: Who belongs, and who decides? The order is ambiguous as to whether it sees Jews as a distinct nationality or a minority race, but either interpretation aligns with Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with defining, and policing, the boundaries of identity.  And the order’s creation of special status for Jews, but not other religious minorities, follows Mr. Trump’s habit of welcoming some demographic groups into the rights and protections of American identity and excluding others. Tellingly, the singling out of Jews for special protection in the order left some feeling still more exposed. Such preoccupations with identity have animated not just the Trump administration but much of the global populist backlash. Leaders and movements across the democratic world are increasingly focused on enforcing narrow national identities of the sort that defined the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The era of hardening national identities includes the rise of far-right parties in Europe, white nationalism in the United States and a campaign for Hindu dominance in India.  Mr. Trump’s order, however narrow its intentions, underscores the degree to which the problems and contradictions of national identity — a distinctly modern invention that remade the world before almost destroying it — remain unresolved. The dilemmas of the new nationalist era are especially surfaced by the order’s focus on Jews, whose relationship to conceptions of race and nationality has always been fraught. It touches on some of the most sensitive questions of Jewish identity — questions that are extensions of ways that national identity both made the modern world and never quite put it back together. The concept, scarcely 200 years old, holds that humanity is divided among fixed communities, each defined by a common language, ethnicity and homeland. Those communities are nations; membership is one’s national identity. The core tenet of nationalism so pervades today’s world that it feels almost self-evident: Any nation of people should have a country, and any country should consist of a nation. The concept of an overarching identity tied to one’s country was invented not by ancient poets or warriors but by 19th-century European governments. As monarchies teetered and the church declined, governments saw engineering common languages and ethnic heritages as a way to justify their rule over polyglot empires, as well as an opportunity to marshal their populations for collective pursuits like industry or war. “Nations as a natural, God-given way of classifying men, as an inherent though long-delayed political destiny, are a myth,” the British-Czech political theorist Ernest Gellner wrote. But this way of thinking reshaped 19th-century Europe, leading to the creation of modern Italy and Germany. It later spread to the rest of the world, inspiring independence and liberation movements on the basis that all people belong to national groups awaiting their nation. National identity’s rise, however, also turned minorities and migrants into second-class citizens — or even into perceived threats within. It turned racial purity into a matter of ethnic, and therefore national, survival. It defined nations as irrevocably divided from one another by race and heritage.  The world, unable to unwind a global order built on national identity, sought to manage its worst tendencies by promoting cultural pluralism, international integration and protections for minorities and migrants.  These values did not so much replace national identity as sit uneasily alongside it,  eventually leading to a backlash.  Leaders like Viktor Orban of Hungary combine the old appeals to blood and soil with something new: promises to smash the systems of multiculturalism and integration seen as posing just as grave a threat to national identity as any minority or migrant. Mr. Trump rose on a similar message, saying about immigration and border restrictions he considered dangerously weak, “You either have a country or you don’t.” Mr. Trump’s order, for purposes of monitoring educational institutions’ handling of discrimination, places Jews under Civil Rights Act protections based on race, color or national origin. The order also draws on a 2005 definition of anti-Semitism, one of whose authors has since said is overly broad, conflating hatred of Jews with criticism of Israel.  Mr. Trump has at times conflated American Jews with Israelis. Speaking to an American Jewish group, he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, as “your prime minister.” He has also described Jewish Democrats who criticized Israeli policies as “disloyal to Israel.” Jewish groups are sensitive to implications that their religion carries a distinct nationality. Centuries of European anti-Semitism were built on the belief that Jews were foreigners within. As late as the 1980s, Soviet passports designated “Jewish” as a nationality akin to Russian or Ukrainian. In the late 19th century, as modern national identity took hold, some Jewish leaders arrived at a position that hinted at the contradictions of the era. They embraced the notion that European Jews really were ethnically distinct from their non-Jewish neighbors — and that all Jews belonged to a unified people. In what was then an era of national self-determination, this also made Jews a nationality that, like many liberation movements of the time, sought a nation of their own. Serbian or Armenian nationalists placed their nations where ethnic Serbs and Armenians lived. But, with Jews dispersed across a half-dozen empires, Zionism’s leaders settled on the ancient biblical land of Judea.  Mr. Trump’s order, by treating anti-Israel protests as a form of anti-Semitism, hits on long-running Jewish debates over whether or not Israel is an extension of a shared identity. The Israeli national narrative, of a long-forgotten homeland waiting to be rediscovered by a citizenry scattered by history, implies a Jewish identity that is innately ethnic and national. Still, American Jewish attitudes toward Israel are cooling; national fealty, for many, is a stretch. The executive order also suggests that the government may see Jews as a distinct race.      Since World War II, American Jews have been on a generational drift from Jewishness as a national identity, which no longer felt as necessary. But a series of political and cultural changes have called that postwar identity into question.  Rising white nationalism increasingly targets Jews as unwelcome outsiders. Conspiracy theories, some entering the mainstream, portray them as nationless cosmopolitans bent on undermining Western countries’ racial purity.    Mr. Trump’s order raises anew a question that has faced Jews throughout the 200-year era of national identity: whether such identities offer them security or only peril. It is an echo of late 19th-century debates, when some urged embracing national identity and forming a state, while others argued for casting it off and integrating into multicultural democracies instead.  The wider democratic world asked itself this same question in the wake of World War II. It declared old-style national identity a curse and pluralistic democracy the only path to peace, but the argument has raged off and on ever since —\xa0as it has, in parallel, for Jews. In a twist of history, the creation of Israel put Jews on the opposite side of the  question: Now they had to decide whether a Jewish national identity had room for minorities. Early Zionist leaders insisted that it did. But more recent Israeli leaders have promoted Israeli identity as exclusively Jewish and have imposed severe restrictions on Palestinians.  Mr. Trump’s order sharpens this matter as well, offering Jews greater protections by curbing anti-Israel activism that is sometimes animated by Palestinian demands for national self-determination. In a sign of how much the world has changed, the new nationalists, from Mr. Orban to Narendra Modi of India, have rallied around Mr. Netanyahu as an ally and model. In a sign of how much it has not changed, all three have invoked ancient ethnic heritage in deploying distinctly modern controls on their country’s religious minorities. Mr. Netanyahu, like Mr. Trump, has emphasized hard-line policies as necessary to preserve Jewish identity.  Perhaps as a result, intra-Jewish debates, whether over Israel’s direction or Mr. Trump’s order, have become something of a microcosm of the global nationalist moment. They have divided American Jews, like much of the world, over whether the movement toward hardened, national-style identities is the solution to their problems — or the problem itself.']","The president said he wanted to target anti-Semitic speech on campuses, but in the time of new nationalism, nothing is really that simple."
"In Bangkok’s Fragrant Street Food, City Planners See a Mess to Clean",2019-12-14,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — The coconut wood pestle hits the mortar, and the chili fumes rise in a cough-inducing haze. The lime rind bruises. Salted crab releases its funk, along with bits of claw and carapace. Shreds of green papaya are tossed in, bathed in a blast of fermented fish paste tempered by palm sugar. The smell is alive and dead, asphyxiating and alluring all at once. More than anything, this green papaya salad, made in a street cart by a woman who has been wielding her pestle for three and a half decades, provides the perfume of Bangkok. But street food vendors — with their pungent salads, oodles of noodles and coconut sweetmeats — have lately become the target of some of the capital’s planners. To them, this metropolis of 10 million residents suffers from an excess of crowds, clutter and health hazards. The floods, the heat, the stench of clogged canals and rotting fruit, the pok pok pok of that pestle — it’s all too much. They prefer an air-conditioned Bangkok, with malls, ice-skating rinks and Instagrammable dessert cafes. They want the street food vendors gone. And so Somboon Chitmani, who has been making green papaya salad in the streets of Bangkok for 36 years, waits. By the end of this year, she has heard, street cooks could be cleared out of central Bangkok.  Already, the number of areas designated for street food has decreased from 683 three years ago to 175, according to the Network of Thai Street Vendors for Sustainable Development. Sakoltee Phattiyakul, the deputy governor of Bangkok, dismissed fears that street food would be gone from Bangkok this year. “No, no, no, we’re not going to ban to zero,” he said, stressing that a local government initiative to clear the city’s sidewalks of clutter was “just a plan that we have had for years.” Others within the government bureaucracy have sent a different message, though, leaving vendors spooked. Earlier this month, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said the sidewalk cleanup campaign was moving ahead. “If they want to get rid of us, we can’t do anything to protest because it’s the law,” Ms. Somboon said. “But Bangkok to me is about street food. Without it, it wouldn’t feel the same.” The sheer variety of food on Bangkok’s streets is astonishing — soups fortified with lemongrass and pork blood, glutinous rice dumplings stuffed with chives, roti rich with condensed milk and bananas. There’s pad thai, too, tangles of wok-charred noodles laced with tamarind and palm sugar. For some Thais, street food is about survival. Nearly 15 percent of Thailand’s citizens live in Bangkok, and many cling to the fringes of one of the world’s most unequal societies. The capital’s notorious traffic forces long commutes, meaning it’s often impractical to return home to eat lunch, or even dinner until late. Besides, many people rent lodging without kitchens. A study by the Beyond Food project, which researches the socioeconomic impact of street food in Bangkok, found that if street food consumers were forced to switch to food courts or convenience store fare, they would have to work an extra day each month at minimum wage to afford the increased prices. “This is not just food for the poor, it’s food for everyone.” said Jorge Carrillo Rodriguez, a Venezuelan social anthropologist, who founded Beyond Food. “Even in Thai slums, people are incredibly picky about what they eat because they are used to a mind-blowing diversity of food.” But even people with middle to high incomes eat an average of 8 to 10 meals per week on the road, the group’s research found. What’s more, any crackdown by city authorities on Bangkok’s street food would disproportionately affect women; about 80 percent of Thailand’s street food purveyors are female, said Raywat Chobtham, of the Thai street vendors network. “Hundreds of thousands of women support their households with their cooking from a cart,” he said. “Do we want to take these jobs away?” Sopa Hojkham came to Bangkok from Thailand’s northeastern heartland to work at a public relations firm. When the Asian financial crisis hit in 1997, she lost her job. So she called home and asked her mother the secret to her green papaya salad. Each day, Ms. Sopa, who wears oversized red-framed glasses to shield her eyes from chili vapors, goes through 66 pounds of green papaya and 132 pounds of chicken wings (about 30 and 60 kilograms), bought at 3 a.m. at a wholesale market. Buckets of chilies are arrayed around her — some like tiny torpedoes named in Thai after mouse droppings; gangly ones roasted a deep crimson; peppers that have a fruity finish and are known in English as birds’ eyes. “Without spicy food, Bangkok would be too calm,” Ms. Sopa said. The value of the capital’s street food was underscored in another way when the Michelin guide began recognizing street stalls alongside restaurants offering foie gras emulsions and truffle ice cream. For three generations, a dim alley in Bangkok’s Chinatown was home to a rice porridge stand opened by an immigrant from southern China. Then, in 2017, the street stall was included in Michelin’s Bangkok edition. Jok Prince, as the eatery is known, has since traded its spot in the alley for walls, a roof and insistent fluorescent lights. The porridge, smoky and studded with meatballs, remains the same. With the new restaurant, “we’re safe,” said Sarunpraphut Unhawat, the granddaughter of the original porridge vendor. “But I wonder, if street food is cleared out of Bangkok, then what will be the city’s selling point?”  Street food is also a family business for Nitisak Trachoo, whose parents have pushed a pair of food carts across Bangkok for 27 years. Mr. Nitisak, 28, once worked as a bellboy but two years ago, when his parents asked him for help, he returned to the streets. Each day, as demure office workers and tourists in short shorts watch, he pours streams of green batter into a mold for tiny cakes fragrant with the vanilla-like juice of the pandan leaf, a common flavoring in Southeast Asia. On a recent afternoon, steam wafted from the griddle, adding a syrupy note to the humid air. “Being a bellboy is a lot easier,” Mr. Nitisak said, mopping away sweat. “But when my parents asked me to help I came right away because it’s the Thai way.” Across town, Ms. Somboon and her husband pounded papaya and grilled fish and chicken in a barrel converted into a grill. A small, golden deity sat on a glass case filled with tomatoes, limes and gangly herbs. A tropical tree shaded the stall. When the couple first claimed this stretch of sidewalk more than three decades ago, they planted the sapling, barely knee high. Now, pots and pans hang from its trunk, and its arc of leaves takes the edge off the heat. The line of customers includes college students, construction workers and housewives with the chill of air-conditioning still clinging to their clothes. Sometimes, Ms. Somboon’s daughter, who works in a law firm, orders takeout from her parents’ stall. A motorcycle delivers plastic bags of their food to the building. Ms. Somboon’s son lives in Colorado. He studied computers in Illinois, and he isn’t going to sweat it out on the streets of Bangkok for a living. “I taught him how to cook before he left,” Ms. Somboon said. “I taught him how to survive.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.

"Battered U.K. Labour Party Ponders Next Move, as Corbyn Plans Exit",2019-12-13,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — It was supposed to be a new dawn, the moment when Jeremy Corbyn, Britain’s most left-wing political leader in a generation or more, proclaimed the start of the most ambitious economic transformation the nation had seen since the end of World War II.  Instead, a somber Mr. Corbyn was seen hugging his allies in the cafeteria of a sports and recreation facility in north London in the early hours of Friday, on his way to announce that his quest for power was over. Like other left-wing parties in Western Europe, Labour is once again in crisis, scrambling for answers to seismic shifts in electoral politics. Labour’s embrace of the leftist vision of Mr. Corbyn — once seen by many members as the party’s salvation — has led to electoral catastrophe. The question now is whether the party changes course and lurches to the center ground or elects a younger leader in Mr. Corbyn’s image, even after he was so thoroughly rejected by the voters on Thursday. Central to that conundrum is whether the voters rejected Mr. Corbyn himself, or his message. How is it that a man who was embraced as a beaming, grandfatherly character in the 2017 general election, making gains for Labour, would just two years later be saddled with some of the lowest approval ratings of any opposition leader in polling history? This time around he doubled down on his anti-austerity pitch of 2017, promising to shower money on social programs and the health service, while nationalizing many utilities and providing free broadband. But rather than exciting people, he seemed to lose them, many doubting his credibility.  His longstanding and, to many of supporters, unfathomable refusal to tackle forcefully anti-Semitism in the party or, in a  TV interview, to apologize, dogged his campaign and poisoned his image. He came to be seen as ineffectual, analysts said. That made him easy prey for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the nation’s predominantly right-wing press, all painting Mr. Corbyn as a dangerous radical who would lead the nation to economic ruin. And there was Brexit, the dominant issue but one that Mr. Corbyn, as a longtime euro-skeptic himself, never could quite come to grips with. Trying to appeal to both sides of his badly divided party, he managed to satisfy no one, by refusing to say which side he was on. To some voters it was perhaps the most critical blow to his credibility. “He failed to lead a proper campaign,” Sarah Rose, a 43-year-old sociologist, said of Mr. Corbyn as she walked her dogs in Clissold Park in the area Mr. Corbyn represents. “He failed to tackle accusations of anti-Semitism, and he failed to have a sensible position on Brexit. It’s devastating.” Speaking early Friday, Mr. Corbyn confirmed that he “will not lead the party in any future general election campaign.” His moment of political pathos unfolded, incongruously, on a stage alongside a novelty election candidate called Nick the Incredible Flying Brick, who wore a large yellow and black hat. What Mr. Corbyn said next — that he would stay on during a period of “reflection” — sets the scene for a ferocious battle over the succession and the soul of a party that was crushed by the Conservatives and has now lost four elections in succession. “This theme of having a period of reflection isn’t to allow people to reflect, it is the very opposite,” said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, describing the tactics of Mr. Corbyn’s close-knit allies. “They want a period of pause after the shock of this defeat to persuade members of their narrative that they need to keep on in the same direction,” he said.  Mr. Corbyn promised to stand aside “in the early part of next year sometime,” perhaps sensing that the party’s lawmakers might force a leadership election if he hangs around too long. Many critics, who were never reconciled to his leadership, feel vindicated. One of those, the veteran Labour lawmaker Margaret Hodge, reacted swiftly to Mr. Corbyn’s speech. “Corbyn talking about a period of ‘reflection,’” she wrote on Twitter, before adding tartly: “I’ve reflected. You failed. Please stand down.”   No successor will have as much baggage as Mr. Corbyn, but the fight to succeed him will be critical nonetheless.  Mr. Corbyn’s ally, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has ruled himself out as a contender, and unless he changes his mind, the “Corbynista” candidate is likely to be Rebecca Long-Bailey. A loyalist, she was raised in Manchester and worked in a pawnshop, call centers, a furniture factory and as a postal worker before eventually studying to become a solicitor. So bad was Labour’s defeat that another Corbyn ally and possible successor, Laura Pidcock, lost her seat in the electoral meltdown. But more centrist candidates will probably include Keir Starmer, who speaks for Labour on Brexit, and Emily Thornberry,  the party’s main speaker on foreign affairs. Ms. Thornberry, though once an ally of Mr. Corbyn, took a more anti-Brexit stance than he did, as did Mr. Starmer. Both were largely sidelined in the election campaign. Other contenders could be Angela Rayner and Jess Phillips. Labour Party members will ultimately choose the next leader, and many are loyal to Mr. Corbyn and his economic agenda, though a majority oppose Brexit. And in a survey among them earlier this year on potential successors, they rated Mr. Starmer as the top contender, with twice as much support as Ms. Long-Bailey. It is not surprising then, that Mr. Corbyn’s allies are already blaming Thursday’s defeat on Brexit, arguing that Labour lost in the north and the middle of the country because it was offering a second Brexit referendum under pressure from remainers, like Mr. Starmer. Ian Lavery, the party chairman, who wants to proceed with Brexit and is an ally of Mr. Corbyn, argued that the cause of the defeat was “not Jeremy Corbyn, it is Brexit and ignoring democracy.”  Yet there are deeper structural reasons for Labour’s loss of support in the parts of the north and middle of the country that defected to the Tories. “Brexit has accelerated a massive change in voting behavior, but not started it,” according to Peter Kellner, a political analyst and former president of YouGov, a polling organization. He noted that, until the mid-1980s, around 80 percent of Labour’s support came from manual workers and their families. With the decline of the big industries, coal mines, shipyards and steelworks, by 2010 white-collar Labour voters outnumbered blue-collar voters.  It will be up to the next leader to build a new coalition of support and decide whether to shift to the political center or try to keep alive Mr. Corbyn’s agenda, despite the crushing defeat. Mr. Fielding said that if the pro-Corbyn faction feels its grip on the party is weakening, things could get nasty. “They were able put to the people the most radical manifesto since World War II. It is their historic opportunity and they are not going to let it go,” he said.

Military’s Preferred Candidate Named Winner in Algeria Election,2019-12-13,By Adam Nossiter,"['Sizable street protests in Algiers and other cities greeted the announcement on Friday that a former Algerian prime minister, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, 74, had been elected the country’s new president in a much-contested vote the day before. Mr. Tebboune will succeed Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who ruled Algeria for 20 years before being chased out of power by popular protests in April.  The protesters, who largely boycotted the election, said it meant little. The country’s real rulers were still the military, they said, and in particular the army chief of staff, Gen. Ahmed Gaïd Salah. Mr. Tebboune was seen as the military establishment’s preferred candidate. Demonstrators coursed through the streets of Algiers on Friday chanting, “We didn’t vote,” over and over. The official turnout in Thursday’s vote was a record low of around 40 percent. The actual turnout was likely far less as the vote was extremely low in the country’s major cities, including Algiers. One Paris-based Algerian analyst, Moussaab Hammoudi of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, citing a contact in the upper ranks of the country’s bureaucracy, said the turnout was actually a fraction of the official number. In Algiers, Abdoulmoumene Khelil, secretary general of the Algerian Human Rights League, agreed. “It’s clear that the officially announced turnout is completely false,” he said. “We saw that nobody came out to vote. We’re used to these completely falsified elections. That’s why we didn’t put forward a candidate.” Protesters rallied in Algiers against the election even as it was being held, staving off aggressive police intervention to do so. Mr. Tebboune had faithfully served Mr. Bouteflika for years: as a local official, as a powerful minister, and then briefly in 2017 as prime minister, before being thrown out of office by Mr. Bouteflika’s brother Saïd, who by then had become the country’s real ruler because of his older sibling’s illness. But analysts said that one reason Mr. Tebboune was the preferred candidate of the military establishment, and of General Gaïd Salah, was because he appeared to have split with the Bouteflika clan, with which the general was in bitter conflict by the end of his tenure. The protesters had long since rejected Mr. Tebboune, as well as the other four candidates in the race, as part of the “system,” their epithet for the ruling elite that has governed the country since independence from France in 1962. The generals who historians and analysts say are the real power-brokers in the country had insisted on holding Thursday’s vote in an effort to move the country past the protest movement. “These were elections ordered by the military command,” Mr. Hammoudi said. “They needed to have these elections, to give themselves a civilian facade. But what Gaïd Salah thought would be a solution, actually only deepens the problem for them.” Mr. Khelil, the rights activist, said that the election “contradicts the will of the people” and was intended to give the existing system a “civil facade.” “It brings nothing concrete to what the people’s movement wants,” he said, speaking from the middle of the big demonstration in Algiers on Friday. “Maybe it resolves an internal problem in ‘the system,’ but it doesn’t resolve the demands of the Algerian people.” On social media, protesters said the protest movement would continue, as it did Friday. Mr. Khelil said either the new president would work to meet the demands of the protesters, beginning with the release of dozens who have been imprisoned in recent months — he thought this unlikely — or the government would double down on repressing the movement, “which would be a fundamental error.” Abdelkrim Boudra, one of Friday’s marchers and a member of an opposition study group, said “the political crisis is only going to get worse.” “They’ve reached the logical end, and they will soon realize that they haven’t resolved anything,” he said, speaking of the authorities. “Yesterday we saw the police unleashed. I hope it stops right there.” Mr. Hammoudi said: “People have only one obsession: to get rid of the regime. This masquerade won’t pacify the movement.” Hadjer Guenanfa contributed reporting from Algiers.']","Antigovernment protesters took to the streets to reject the vote as illegitimate.

France Extradites Argentine Man Suspected of Torture,2019-12-15,By Elian Peltier and Daniel Politi,"['A former police officer from Argentina who has lived for more than 30 years as a university lecturer and security expert in France was extradited and arrived on Monday in his native country, where he is wanted for crimes against humanity, including torture, committed during the country’s dictatorship, the French lawyer representing Argentina said. The news of the extradition of the former police officer, Mario Sandoval, was welcomed in Argentina by human rights activists and relatives of victims of the military regime, which killed up to 30,000 people, according to estimates, between 1976 and 1983.  But even as Mr. Sandoval was arrested at his home in a Paris suburb on Wednesday, many in France tried to fathom how a suspected torturer was able to live there for decades, teaching international affairs, participating in security conferences on Latin America and working with French security officials.  Prosecutors in Argentina have accused Mr. Sandoval, 66, of having participated in the death of an architecture student, Hernán Abriata, who disappeared in 1976 at a notorious secret detention center in Buenos Aires.  Argentine prosecutors believe he may also have been connected to the disappearance of many other civilians while he was a police officer in his 20s.  Argentina requested his extradition in 2012, but Mr. Sandoval denied the accusations and appealed every decision until he ran out of legal options. Last week, France’s top administrative court approved his extradition.  Mr. Sandoval appealed the decision to the European Court of Human Rights; his appeal was rejected. “It’s a relief and a delight to see Mr. Sandoval finally extradited,” said Sophie Thonon-Wesfreid, a French lawyer who has represented Argentina in the proceedings. “Hernán Abriata’s mother is 92, she’s been waiting for 43 years.” Mr. Sandoval’s lawyer, Jérôme Rousseau, said the trial his client would face in Argentina would be “political,” in a country that he said was undergoing a “purge.”  Since 2006, Argentina has undergone an enormous effort to punish former military officers and their accomplices. Courts have convicted 962 of the almost 3,300 people who have been accused of crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, and stealing babies from pregnant detainees and giving them up for adoption. Mr. Abriata was one of about 5,000 people who disappeared at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy, or ESMA, which was converted into Argentina’s largest clandestine detention center.  The former detention center is now a human rights memorial.  Some of those suspected of these crimes, like Mr. Sandoval, moved abroad after the end of the dictatorship, delaying their prosecution and extending the wait of family members who sought justice for their missing relatives. “This means the beginning of the end to his impunity, an impunity he enjoyed since the day he was in charge of a gang at the ESMA and kidnapped my brother,” said Laura Abriata, Mr. Abriata’s sister. \x08After Mr. Sandoval moved to France in 1985, he taught at the Université of Marne-la-Vallée, outside of Paris, and at the New Sorbonne University. He obtained French citizenship in 1997, according to his lawyer. At the New Sorbonne, he worked at the Institute of High Studies for Latin America, a highly regarded institution known for welcoming exiles who fled the dictatorships in Argentine, Brazil or Chile. Many of his colleagues felt Mr. Sandoval’s presence there had left a stain on the institute.  “It is pathetic that someone accused of crimes against humanity, a torturer, was allowed to train young people at university,” said Denis Merklen, a professor at the institute who, like Mr. Sandoval, holds French and Argentine citizenship.  Mr. Sandoval was hired as a lecturer at the institute in 1999, when France’s current education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, ran it. Through an aide, Mr. Blanquer denied knowing at the time Mr. Sandoval was hired, about the charges he is now facing.  For more than 20 years after the end of the dictatorship, two amnesty laws in Argentina protected officials involved in the regime’s crimes. The laws were overturned in 2005 — the same year Mr. Sandoval was dismissed from the New Sorbonne, although for reasons unrelated to the accusations he currently faces.  His name was connected to the crimes committed by the dictatorship in 2008, when the Argentine newspaper Página 12 published an investigation about him. Olivier Compagnon, a professor of contemporary history who ran the institute from 2015 to 2019 and taught an introductory class on Venezuela with Mr. Sandoval in 2003, said students complained that Mr. Sandoval was obsessed with weapons and security issues. He also questioned how the institute could have recruited someone who had so few qualifications.  Mr. Sandoval’s resume from the late 1990s, which The New York Times saw, starts in 1985 and states that he taught at a dozen institutions, but didn’t specify which universities he had attended.  “It’s nonsensical,” Mr. Compagnon said. “Today we would never hire someone with such a vague profile and resume.” Mr. Abriata’s relatives said they hoped justice could now be done.  “We expect a fair trial with all the legal guarantees so his constitutional rights are respected, which none of the 30,000 who were disappeared enjoyed,” Ms. Abriata, Hernán Abriata’s sister, said. Elian Peltier reported from London, and Daniel Politi from Buenos Aires.']","Mario Sandoval was sent to his native country to face charges of crimes committed during the dictatorship.

How Labour’s Working-Class Vote Crumbled and Its Nemesis Won the North,2019-12-13,By Benjamin Mueller,"['BARLBOROUGH, England — They trudged through a stinging rain to polling stations, streams of people who once powered the left in Britain: ex-miners, supermarket clerks, retired schoolteachers, health aides. But when they re-emerged, they had voted not for the Labour Party, the side that had shepherded them through decades of political upheaval, but instead for their old nemesis, the party long despised here for shutting down the mines and shrinking the British state: the Conservatives. “I’m from a Labour background: the coal pits and fighting Maggie Thatcher and everything else,” said Dawn Ridsdale, 56, an unemployed sales agent, as she stood outside the converted barn in Barlborough where she cast her ballot. She had opposed Brexit, but now wanted someone with the ruthless streak of the prime minister who had closed the mines, Margaret Thatcher, to sort it out, once and for all. “The country’s on its backside,” she said. “I’ve unfortunately had to vote for Boris. He’s the best of a bad bunch.” She meant Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, the upper-class eccentric who defied half a century of political geography on Thursday to tear through Labour’s old coalition of small-town, working-class voters in the Midlands and north of England, a block of seats once thought so impregnable that it was called the Red Wall. Down went at least nine seats that Labour had held without interruption since the Second World War. Down went a type of tribal politics in northern England, in which people inherited voting customs from their parents and grandparents, passing fights over mine closures and benefit cuts down the generations.  And down went Dennis Skinner, the so-called Beast of Bolsover, an ex-miner and Labour lawmaker whose fusion of socialism and pro-Brexit values had put him in control of Bolsover, the constituency around Barlborough, for 49 years. For Labour, which suffered its worst election defeat since 1935, the results signaled the end of an era of being able to reach into both thriving cities and left-behind former mining villages for votes. The party’s two wings — pro- and anti-immigrant, young and old, university graduates and tradespeople — were cleaved.  “It’s the detachment of the Labour Party from great swaths of the country, which they seem not to sympathize with,” said Robert Tombs, a historian at the University of Cambridge. “That leaves the party in a pretty dire position in the long term, unless it can miraculously reinvent itself.” The big, longstanding parties of the left started vanishing from Europe years ago as class alliances faded in a postindustrial economy. But the consequences of the political realignment in Britain, as in the United States, are much graver because their two-party systems prevent left-wing parties from simply resolving their differences by splitting. The left is now squabbling on both sides of the Atlantic, with both the Labour and Democratic parties grappling with a rancorous battle between young activists and more moderate voters. The results yesterday in Britain were a sobering lesson in the consequences of destroying age-old party alliances before new ones had time to germinate, analysts said. “You’ll have the pro-migration, culturally liberal left saying, ‘We don’t want to ally with racists,’ and you’ll have the socially conservative, economically left-wing part of the coalition saying, ‘We don’t ally with people who think we’re racists,’ and that’s a very, very hard argument to resolve,” said Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. By Friday morning, Britons awoke to a Labour Party largely consigned to the cities of England. The Conservatives, on the other hand, harnessed the power of Brexit to storm districts where the party’s brand had been toxic for generations. In doing so, they replicated the success of President Trump in breaching the so-called Blue Wall in states like Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, exploiting a combination of anti-immigrant messaging and dissolving class allegiances to take seats thought to belong to the Democrats. Whether Britons voted for a permanent realignment on Thursday, or merely one long enough to carry them through Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn’s disastrous leadership of Labour, was the big unknown. But outside the pubs, churches, schoolhouses and trailers where people in Bolsover cast their ballots on Thursday, it was clear that many ex-Labour voters felt more at home for the moment in Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party than anywhere else. They bemoaned a decade of broken promises, many of them made by the Conservative Party, but bought into Mr. Johnson’s idea that the political elite, and not his party, were to blame. They were seething with anger: at immigrants, at Britain’s postindustrial economy and at the constant gaze of the country’s news media and political elite in the south, toward London. And above all, the people who made up Labour’s old base in Bolsover unburdened themselves of their withering feelings about Mr. Corbyn, spitting epithets — “Marxist,” “terrorist sympathizer,” “idiot” — about a man who made them far more unhappy than even an old Etonian like Mr. Johnson could. In Bolsover, the market town at the center of this sprawling district, one voter, Thomas, pointed from the polling station to where he had spent three decades working in a coal mine. For all its dangers, mining had held the promise of steady work and fair pay, and came with all the advantages of union protection now absent in the industries that took its place. But for Thomas and his wife, Christine, who declined to give their last name because they did not want friends to know how they voted, frustration at the region’s decline became wedded to anger at the immigrant workers who took the low-wage jobs that replaced mining. “Jobs there should have gone to ex-miners, not to foreign workers,” Christine said of a warehouse on the site of a nearby mine. “Instead you see ex-miners thrown in the scrap heap.” They had just been shopping near the warehouse, and found themselves among so many Polish people that, Thomas said, “we were foreigners.” Lifelong Labour voters, they broke from much of the party in supporting Brexit and then finally stopped voting for it because of Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, they said, dominated as it was by an economic agenda too far to the left and a leadership rooted in London. “It hurts,” Thomas said, though not all his allegiance was lost. “I still am a Labour man. I’ll vote Labour again when they get rid of this lot.” Britain’s political realignment holds risks for the Conservative Party, too.  Just as the Republicans in the United States seized the South, only to find themselves suddenly unable to win seats in places like New England, so too do the Conservatives risk losing their socially liberal voters in southern England if they become dominated by the ex-Labour heartlands of the north, Professor Ford said. At the same time, in a country growing more diverse, the Labour Party will eventually benefit from aligning itself to socially liberal values — but not for some time, and not unless its supporters spread out across the electoral map, said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. Many voters in Bolsover described a drift from Labour that started years ago, well before Brexit, as ties to trade unions frayed and the Labour leadership became identified with increasing immigration. But it was Brexit that cemented their vote for the Conservatives. While the idea of rerunning the Brexit referendum a second time had taken hold in London, it sounded to voters in Bolsover, Leavers and Remainers alike, like a serious threat to democratic legitimacy. “There’s been a referendum, and there’s a will of the people to leave, despite my personal beliefs,” said Craig Beddow, a retail worker in the area. “I don’t think the country can risk a hung Parliament, because we’re just static now. Despite my beliefs about Remain, I think we need to get on with it and let the country move on.” Not that he harbored any affection for Mr. Johnson, whom he called “the worst conservative leader in my lifetime.” Barry Salt, another voter, had similar sentiments, saying that Mr. Johnson was “a fool,” but that Mr. Corbyn was worse: “He’s going to turn this into a communist state if he’s left alone.” Many voters knew and loved Mr. Skinner, the longest-serving lawmaker running for a seat in this election, and some Labour loyalists said nothing could sway their vote. “I’d vote for a donkey with a red rose on it,” said Jason Vardy, a bookmaker, referring to the symbol for Labour. His father, Stanley, an ex-miner, felt the same way: “If I voted Tory, my dad would’ve shot me.” But for others, being a Labour lawmaker was exactly what was wrong with Mr. Skinner. Despite the lawmaker’s own pro-Brexit views, the Labour label put him on the side of the big-city elites who looked down their noses at the north. “If he weren’t a Labour man, he’d be brilliant,” said Malcolm Shaw, a military veteran and ex-Labour voter, after ticking a box for the Conservatives.']",The Labour Party’s devastating defeat in an ex-stronghold has grave consequences for a party: Its two wings — older and working class and urban and educated — appear to have irreconcilable differences.
Strong Earthquake Hits the Southern Philippines,2019-12-15,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — An earthquake measuring magnitude 6.9 rocked the southern Philippines on Sunday afternoon, causing scenes of panic and killing at least one child and injuring a least 15 others, officials said. Vincent Fernandez, the mayor of the town of Matanao, told local radio that a 6-year-old girl died after a wall collapsed on her during the powerful earthquake. The United States Geological Survey said the quake’s epicenter was near the town of Magsaysay in the populated province of Davao del Sur on Mindanao island. A second quake, a magnitude-5.7, followed not long after. The initial earthquake was the third of magnitude 6.5 or higher to hit the area, southwest of Davao City, since late October. Those two earlier quakes, which struck over the course of three days, as well as two others in October and November, left more than 20 people dead.  Because of its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions caused by the movement of tectonic plates. On Sunday, the Philippine Information Agency reported that shoppers and employees were believed to be trapped inside a collapsed store in the town of Padada. Flower vendors at a market in Padada were also trapped by a collapsed wall, according to a local radio station. Photographs on social media showed several people trying to extricate them. Other photos showed damaged buildings and cracked roads. “It was so strong; the house shook and swayed. We immediately rushed out,” said Aldrin Tumanda, a hotel worker in the area. “It felt as strong as the previous earthquakes.” He said neighbors in his community also rushed out of their homes, but returned after several minutes.']","A 6-year-old girl died after a wall collapsed on her during the powerful quake, the third of magnitude 6.5 or higher to strike the area since late October."
North Korea Links 2nd ‘Crucial’ Test to Nuclear Weapons Program,2019-12-14,By David E. Sanger and Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — A second test of what appeared to be an advanced missile engine, part of what North Korea said on Saturday was part of a “reliable strategic nuclear deterrent,” left little doubt that the country is moving quickly toward resuming the program that led to a crisis with Washington two years ago. While the North gave no details, it said it had conducted “another crucial test” on Friday night at a missile-engine and satellite-launching site that leader Kim Jong-un had once promised President Trump he was about to close. It was the second such test in a week, and came after weeks of increasingly vocal attempts to press the United States into further talks and new concessions.  All the available evidence indicated it was some kind of advanced missile engine, and the wording of the North Korean announcement strongly suggested it was part of a renewal of the country’s nuclear delivery systems.  American analysts and intelligence experts said they believe the ground test — conducted at a stationary stand designed to demonstrate experimental missile-engine designs — was intended as a signal that the country could soon resume testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile.  While the North demonstrated in 2017 that its fleet could likely reach parts of the United States, the country still has not shown it could design a warhead that would survive the heat and huge forces that come with re-entry of a warhead into the atmosphere. But such a test, both officials and outside analysts speculate, might come within a month, after the expiration of a North Korea-imposed deadline for solid progress with the United States. The American special envoy for Korean nuclear affairs, Stephen Biegun, is in South Korea’s capital, Seoul, this weekend to try to conduct some last-minute diplomacy, perhaps including a meeting with North Korean diplomats at the Demilitarized Zone.  Mr. Biegun has been nominated to become deputy secretary of state and could then become acting secretary should Mike Pompeo resign to run for the Senate from Kansas.  Inside the administration, even President Trump has begun warning that the leader-to-leader diplomacy that he thought would cut through differences is at risk. Until this weekend, North Korean officials have usually avoided describing their renewed efforts as part of a military nuclear program.  But they have now dropped that pretense. Any significant missile or nuclear test would unambiguously contradict Mr. Trump’s assertion that he has already changed the North’s behavior. And it would pose the risk of a renewed confrontation in the midst of the president’s re-election campaign. Mr. Trump tweeted last week that the North should not “interfere” in the election.  A ground test alone does not change the North’s ability to strike at its neighbors. But it suggests a full-scale resumption of activity Mr. Trump had been told was suspended.  Michael Elleman, the director of nonproliferation and nuclear studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, tweeted on Saturday that “these ground tests benefit the DPRK strategic capabilities considerably, so they serve technical and political imperatives.” The test was successfully conducted on Friday night at the “Sohae Satellite Launching Ground,” a spokesman of the North’s Academy of Defense Science said. That was a reference to facilities in Tongchang-ri, near the North’s northwestern border with China, where it also said it had conducted a “a very important test” last Saturday.  South Korean officials have said that the earlier test was of an engine that could power either a satellite-carrying rocket or a ballistic missile.  On Saturday, the North Korean spokesman said the successful results of both tests would “be applied to further bolstering up the reliable strategic nuclear deterrent” of North Korea, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. In a separate statement on Saturday, Pak Jong-chon, the chief of the general staff of the North Korean People’s Army, said the data from the latest tests would help develop “another strategic weapon” to deter the United States. “We should be ready to cope with political and military provocations of the hostile forces, and be familiar with both dialogue and confrontation,” Mr. Pak said. He said the United States and other forces would “spend the year-end in peace only when they hold off any words and deeds rattling us.” Mr. Pak’s comments suggested that the tests could have been for an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile, said Cheong Seong-chang, the vice president of research planning at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The statement also signaled that, as diplomacy stalled, the voice of North Korea’s hard-line military was rising, Mr. Cheong said. North Korea has repeatedly indicated that it would abandon diplomacy and could resume weapons tests unless Washington met a Dec. 31 deadline — set by Mr. Kim — for the United States to return to the negotiating table with more concessions, including the easing of international sanctions.  Mr. Kim is widely expected to use a meeting of his Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, scheduled for this month, and his annual New Year’s Day speech to reveal his new policy options. The resumption of activities at Tongchang-ri, where a satellite was last launched in February 2016, has worried officials in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo because the site houses facilities to test rocket engines and launch satellite-delivery vehicles. Although North Korea insists that its space program is peaceful, Washington and its allies said that the program was a front for efforts to build and test technologies for intercontinental ballistic missiles. A series of resolutions by the United Nations Security Council ban North Korea from testing ballistic missile technology. In March 2017, North Korea successfully tested a high-thrust engine at Tongchang-ri that it used in intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, later that year. Analysts fear that North Korea might now be preparing to launch another long-range rocket carrying a satellite or even to flight-test a long-range missile. The country conducted its last ICBM test from Pyongsong, north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in November 2017. Afterward, Mr. Kim declared a halt on all nuclear and ICBM tests and embarked on diplomacy with President Trump. Mr. Kim met with Mr. Trump in Singapore in June 2018 and agreed to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” in return for “new” relations and security guarantees from Washington. After the Singapore meeting, Mr. Trump boasted that Mr. Kim had promised to dismantle the Tongchang-ri facilities as one of the first steps toward denuclearization. North Korea started to dismantled the missile-engine test facility that summer, but then rebuilt it, after Mr. Kim’s subsequent meetings with Mr. Trump and negotiations between diplomats failed to resolve differences over how to implement the broadly worded Singapore deal. North Korea has also resumed the test of mostly short-range ballistic missiles and rockets this year. Mr. Trump has largely dismissed such tests as involving weapons that do not directly threaten the United States. If North Korea returned to launching satellites or testing ICBMs, it could seriously dent Mr. Trump’s foreign-policy credentials. Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited Mr. Kim’s self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and ICBM tests as one of his major achievements.']","As a top American envoy visits the region, the North declared that tests would bolster its “reliable strategic nuclear deterrent.”"
"In Johnson Victory, Democrats and Republicans See Lessons for 2020",2019-12-13,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Britain was still counting the final votes in its landmark election early Friday morning when Democrats and Republicans on the other side of the Atlantic began asking what Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s landslide victory meant for them: Was it a good omen for President Trump’s re-election chances in 2020, a cautionary tale for Democrats, or both? It had happened before, in June 2016: Britain’s angry vote to leave the European Union was seen as a canary-in-the-coal-mine for Mr. Trump’s insurgent victory over Hillary Clinton five months later. On Friday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump latched on to the idea that history might repeat itself. “I think that might be a harbinger of what’s to come in our country,” he said of Mr. Johnson’s big win. But if there are parallels, there are also important differences between this British election and the American one next year. Mr. Johnson appealed to the same populist sentiments that fueled the 2016 votes in both countries. But unlike in the United States, he also seized on a sense of nationwide exhaustion with Brexit, a desire to break the political deadlock and, as he put it, “Get Brexit Done.” Mr. Trump cheered on Mr. Johnson from the sidelines, even as the British prime minister desperately tried to keep a distance from the American president. That underlined another difference between the two leaders: the president’s disruptive style and deep unpopularity with large segments of the electorate, which drew comparisons to Jeremy Corbyn, the vanquished Labour leader, rather than to the breezy Mr. Johnson. For all his populist bluster, Mr. Johnson rejected a proposal to join forces with the hard-right Brexit Party, calculating he could win a Parliamentary majority without its help. In victory, he has appealed for unity with promises of funding for schools and the National Health Service, a big-government approach that would not be out of character for a European Social Democrat. For Republicans, who have fully embraced Mr. Trump, Mr. Johnson’s victory shows not just the continuing potency of populism but also its limits. For Democrats, who have been enmeshed in a battle between their progressive and moderate wings, the Labour Party’s defeat is a useful example, since party officials have long debated the risks of tacking to the left. Still, there is no equivalent in the crowded Democratic presidential field to Mr. Corbyn, a deeply divisive figure whom several Labour officials accused of blowing an election that his party could have won. “There’s going to be a huge debate about why Labour lost, which has ramifications in the United States,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center for the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “Some Democrats will say it lost because Corbyn was unpopular and the party had an anti-Semitism problem,” Mr. Wright said. “Others will say the party’s left-wing economic policy was the problem.” Joe Biden, the leading moderate Democrat in the presidential race, lost no time making the latter case. Speaking at a fund-raiser in San Francisco on Thursday, he predicted that the Labour loss would be chalked up to its extreme positions. “Look what happens when the Labour Party moves so, so far to the left,” Mr. Biden said, characterizing the analysis he expected. “It comes up with ideas that are not able to be contained within a rational basis quickly.” It was a not-so-subtle plea to Democrats to choose him over liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Johnson’s victory, Mr. Biden said, would also be interpreted as promising for Mr. Trump, since he is “kind of a physical and emotional clone of the president.” Sure enough, Mr. Trump, who has cultivated a close relationship with Mr. Johnson, tweeted, “Looking like a big win for Boris in the U.K!” and followed it up with a promise that once Britain left the European Union, it would be free to strike a “massive new Trade Deal” with the United States. Given the historically close ties between the United States and Britain, it is telling that this election was characterized more by the distance those on each side kept from the other. Mr. Johnson played down his friendship with Mr. Trump, pleading with the president not to intervene in the election during his visit to a NATO meeting in London in the days leading up to the vote. Mr. Trump is such a radioactive figure in Britain that the Conservatives feared his public endorsement would backfire on the prime minister. Until his congratulatory tweets on Thursday evening, Mr. Trump largely complied. On the Democratic side, liberal figures like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders kept Mr. Corbyn at arm’s length — a reflection, analysts said, of the accusations of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, as well as the belief that he was not going to do well. Among prominent Democrats, only Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and a supporter of Mr. Sanders, publicly endorsed Mr. Corbyn’s party. (A top official in Mr. Sanders’ campaign, however, also posted a message of support Thursday on Twitter. ) Stephen K. Bannon, former chief strategist to Mr. Trump, contends that the president’s victory in 2016 was “inextricably linked” to the Brexit vote. He views Mr. Johnson’s success as revealing deeper political currents that could threaten the chances of the Democratic nominee in 2020. “It’s not just about Corbyn,” he said. “If they don’t grasp the reality of the rejection of the program of Corbyn, they’re going to get a brutal lesson.” But Mr. Bannon said the election also held lessons for populists on the right. Mr. Johnson’s rebuff of the Brexit Party, which had proposed campaigning together on a hard-line, pro-Brexit platform, will free the prime minister to try to draw the Conservative Party back to the political center.  “You will see a limited appetite for populism in the Tory party,” Mr. Bannon said. “They see that they didn’t need it.” Some British analysts dismissed the argument that Labour’s loss was a repudiation of its agenda, saying that some of its proposals, like increased funding for the National Health Service, were popular with much of the electorate. The problem, they said, was the party’s standard-bearer. Mr. Corbyn’s hard-left ideology makes Ms. Warren look moderate, political analysts said, while Mr. Sanders is far more personally popular than the Labour leader. The Sanders campaign has calculated that by moving left, it can mobilize a multiracial working-class coalition, while at the same time luring back rural white voters. To some Democratic strategists, the Labour Party represents the worst-case scenario of that gamble: Moving left did not retain working-class voters in the British Midlands and the north — the party’s bedrock support — but drove off center-left professionals in the south of Britain, who voted to stay in the European Union. Still, Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College in London, said, “Bernie Sanders is an infinitely more effective politician than Jeremy Corbyn.” For Democrats, there are tactical lessons in Labour’s defeat. Mr. Johnson ran a highly disciplined campaign, pounding home his message that he would “Get Brexit Done” and avoiding debates over kitchen-table issues, like health care, which could have played to the advantage of Labour. “It shows the importance of discipline,” Mr. Menon said. “There was a simplicity of message.” Mr. Johnson also successfully framed his campaign as a revolt against Britain’s political establishment. Parliament, he said, had thwarted the democratic will of the people in not delivering Brexit. The prime minister bludgeoned Mr. Corbyn for his muddled position on Brexit. Mr. Trump is likely to use a variation on the people vs. the establishment narrative, attacking Democrats in Congress, who are on track to impeach him, for trying to thwart the will of the voters who elected him in 2016. As in the United States, Britain’s election was characterized by extraordinary rancor and a blizzard of dubious claims from the candidates. And, as in the United States, the peculiarities of the British political system guaranteed that the winner was not the party that got the most votes. While Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won a 79-seat majority in Parliament, they and the other pro-Brexit parties drew only 46 percent of the vote. The Labour Party, and other parties that either oppose Brexit or want to rethink Britain’s departure, won 52 percent. Britain’s first-past-the-post system — meaning that in each constituency, the candidate who gets the most votes wins, regardless whether that’s a majority — allowed the Conservatives to win a disproportionate share of seats. This has prompted debates about overhauling the electoral system that echoed the calls for reform after Mr. Trump defeated Mrs. Clinton in the Electoral College, despite losing to her by 2.8 million votes. And like in the United States, there seems little prospect of changing the system any time soon. Alexander Burns contributed reporting from New York, and Jonathan Martin from Washington. ']",The 2016 Brexit vote seemed to be a harbinger of President Trump’s election. But Boris Johnson’s victory may be different.
U.K. Election Result Starts Clock on Brexit Talks With E.U.,2019-12-13,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — European leaders on Friday welcomed the clarity of the British election result, since they, too, want to “get Brexit done.” But Boris Johnson’s substantial majority will only start the clock on new negotiations about Britain’s future trading and security relationship with the European Union. Few except Mr. Johnson expect the talks to be quick or easy. They can be quick, Brussels argues, if Britain agrees to keep its regulations and tariffs the same or very close to those of the bloc. But European leaders, in Brussels for the last day of a summit meeting, remain unsure whether Mr. Johnson, with his resounding mandate to ratify his Brexit deal by the end of January, will stick to his campaign pledge to finish any trade negotiation with the European Union by the end of 2020, or whether he will choose next summer to seek a year’s delay for longer talks.  Will this be the Mr. Johnson who vowed once “to die in a ditch” or the Mr. Johnson who reached his draft Brexit deal with Brussels last October by abandoning his red lines over Northern Ireland? In congratulating Mr. Johnson on his Conservative Party’s decisive victory, Charles Michel, president of the European Council, sounded a note of concern, saying, “We expect as soon as possible a vote by the British Parliament on the withdrawal agreement — it is important to have the clarity as soon as possible.” So long as the two sides are negotiating, Britain will be in a “transition” period, with its relationship with the European Union essentially unchanged, even if it will legally have ceased to be a member. Mr. Michel said that Brussels “will negotiate to ensure to have a close cooperation in the future with the U.K.,” adding, “The integrity of the single market is a very important issue for us.” Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said, “I hope that Boris Johnson ‘delivers,’ as he said himself during his campaign, because people need to have clarity, and I hope that with yesterday’s results, they do.” He added, “The excuse that there is no clear majority in London doesn’t last anymore.” But he suggested talks on the future relationship were “not going to be simple.” Brussels, in its conclusions on Brexit, is demanding a future relationship that “will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations and ensure a level playing field.” That is Brussels-speak for British regulations and rules that do not diverge too far from Europe’s. But if Mr. Johnson wants a free hand to make trade deals with the United States and other countries and to position Britain as more of a low-tax, light-regulation economy, Brussels will demand a tougher set of trade restrictions, unwilling to have a large competitor so close with significantly more favorable conditions for business and finance. European leaders have agreed that the negotiations will be led by Michel Barnier, who also led the Brexit withdrawal negotiations and knows the issues well. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said on Friday that Brussels would be ready to begin talks on Feb. 1, and that its goals were “zero tariffs, zero quotas, zero dumping.” Eleven months would be a short time in which to finish a deal, she said, “but this is what we work for.” The talks “will be step by step but in an attitude that says we want to be good neighbors,” she added. Mr. Johnson may favor a hard deadline, but that will put Britain, which will soon be negotiating from outside rather than inside the European Union, into a weaker position, argued Fabian Zuleeg, head of the European Policy Center, a research institution based in Brussels. The risk is that a quick trade negotiation, considered almost a contradiction in terms by trade experts, could fail, bringing Britain and Brussels back to the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit. Many British businesspeople — and presumably some of the new Conservative Party members of Parliament from the industrial north of England — will want to be able to trade with Brussels with as little friction and paperwork as possible. That would mean closer alignment to the European Union than harder-line Brexiters advocate. “One advantage of a closer E.U. relationship is that there would be a better chance of clinching a deal by next December,” said Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group in a briefing note. “The disadvantage is that Johnson’s current Euroskeptic allies would oppose E.U. demands such as a level playing field on regulation.’’ But what British ministers describe privately as “the crucial divergence question” has barely been discussed in the cabinet, Mr. Rahman said, while noting that Mr. Johnson was likely to reshuffle his cabinet before too long. Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, has managed his key goal: preventing the restoration of a hard border on the island with Northern Ireland. But he also wants to preserve close ties in a future relationship, he said on Friday — “a trade deal or trade deal plus” — to “ensure that we still have a tariff-free trade between Britain and the E.U. and a set of minimum standards.” That way, Mr. Varadkar said, “nobody feels that there is unfair competition, especially when it comes to labor rights or environmental protection.”  On climate, the leaders said they had agreed on a goal of a carbon-neutral European Union by 2050, but in fact Poland secured a temporary exemption Friday morning, citing its coal-dependent economy and a lack of transitional funding, which ties into another complicated debate about the bloc’s next seven-year budget. President Emmanuel Macron of France expressed confidence that the Poles would go along eventually, and said the exemption “doesn’t slow down the implementation of the green deal.” Hungary and the Czech Republic also went along when they were assured that nuclear power would be recognized as an element of their domestic energy supply in order to get to carbon neutral. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, whose country relies on highly polluting coal for some 80 percent of its energy needs, said the negotiations had been “very difficult,” adding, “Poland will be reaching climate neutrality at its own pace.” Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary insisted that the less-affluent countries of Central Europe must get generous financial guarantees. “We cannot allow Brussels bureaucrats to have poor people and poor countries to pay the costs of the fight against climate change,” he said.']",Few expect the negotiations on the country’s future trade and security relationship with the bloc to be quick or easy.
An Arsenal Star Criticized China’s Detention Camps. Fury Soon Followed.,2019-12-14,By Chris Buckley,"['BEIJING — The German soccer star Mesut Özil is the latest international sports celebrity to be at the center of controversy over China’s hard-line policies, igniting fury among Chinese internet users by denouncing the country’s mass detention of Muslims. Mr. Özil, who is of Turkish heritage and plays for Arsenal, an English Premier League club, took on one of China’s most sensitive policies with his comments on Friday about Uighurs, a largely Muslim Turkic minority in Xinjiang, in northwestern China. The Chinese authorities have held as many as a million Uighurs, and possibly more, in indoctrination camps meant to drastically weaken their commitment to Islam. The internments have drawn international anger and led to legislation in the United States Congress that could impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the detentions, which China says are intended to deter terrorism. “They shut down their mosques. They ban their schools. They kill their holy men. The men are forced into camps and their families are forced to live with Chinese men,” read identical posts on Mr. Özil’s Twitter and Instagram accounts, according to a translation by The Guardian. “But Muslims are silent,” they read. “Don’t they know that giving consent for persecution is persecution itself?” While some foreign celebrities and companies who have offended Chinese sensitivities in recent years seem to have done so unwittingly, there seems little doubt that Mr. Özil’s remarks were carefully chosen. His reference to Xinjiang as East Turkestan, a name for the region used by advocates of self-rule for Uighurs, made matters worse for many Chinese. Arsenal quickly tried to distance itself from Mr. Özil’s posts, but the club’s response did not stave off a wave of online anger in China. “The content posted was entirely Özil’s personal view,” Arsenal said in a statement early Saturday on Weibo, a social media platform that, like Twitter, allows users to share comments. “As a football club, Arsenal always adheres to the principle of keeping out of politics.” That statement was not enough, many commentators in China said.  Some likened the controversy to one in October, when the N.B.A. was the target of condemnation. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, had issued a tweet (quickly deleted) that seemed to express sympathy with protesters in Hong Kong demanding democracy.  The N.B.A., in a statement in Chinese, said it was “extremely disappointed” by Mr. Morey’s tweet. But the N.B.A.’s commissioner, Adam Silver, then said that the league was committed to freedom of speech for its employees, drawing another round of anger from Chinese basketball fans and state media. “Özil, you’re even worse than Morey!” read an online article in Global Times, a stridently nationalist Chinese tabloid, on Saturday. It cited an outpouring of furious comment on the Chinese internet, including an announcement that a fan chat room devoted to Mr. Özil would close. “As Chinese people we cannot accept this,” the chat room announced. “Where nationalist interests are concerned, nobody’s personal pastimes are worthy of mentioning.” China’s internet is heavily censored, usually making it an echo chamber of officially approved opinion. Even so, many Chinese people do support the government’s harsh policies in Xinjiang, including the detention camps, which the government calls job training centers. In his comments, Mr. Özil referred to the widespread reluctance of many Muslim-majority countries to openly criticize China over its policies in Xinjiang. Chinese officials may worry that his statement could inspire more Muslims abroad to demand action against Beijing. Mr. Özil’s comments “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people,” the Chinese Football Association said in a statement quoted by The Paper, a news site based in Shanghai. “This is unacceptable to us,” the association said. International debate about Xinjiang escalated in recent weeks after investigative reports from The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that provided new details about the indoctrination camps.  The Chinese government has denounced the reports as false or as part of a conspiracy to foment ethnic unrest in Xinjiang. The government also issued English-language videos to make the case that China was menaced by extremist violence among Uighurs.  Many foreign experts argue that while anti-Chinese violence has been a problem in Xinjiang, the government has unfairly painted vast numbers of Uighurs as potential extremists and exacerbated ethnic divisions with its mass detentions. If recent experience offers any guidance, Mr. Özil and Arsenal can expect days, maybe weeks, of bitter criticism from Chinese media and officials.  “It’s safe to say that this incident will damage the image of Özil and the Arsenal club in the eyes of Chinese football fans,” Hu Xijin, the editor of Global Times, wrote in a commentary. But he advised fans not to go too far and stoke international attention.  “I argue that we Chinese people should maintain a scornful attitude toward these kinds of people and their games,” he said.']","The soccer club distanced itself after Mesut Özil condemned China’s mass detention of Uighurs.

Italy’s New ‘Sardines’ Movement Packs Piazzas to Protest Far-Right Leader,2019-12-14,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — A grass-roots movement protesting the populism of the far-right Italian leader Matteo Salvini demonstrated its surging strength on Saturday, drawing tens of thousands of people to a vast square in Rome in its first national rally. The Sardines movement, named for its ability to pack piazzas, reflects a general disgust among many liberal Italians over Mr. Salvini’s anti-migrant and anti-European language. “Something has already changed in the Italian political panorama,” said Mattia Santori, 32, one of the movement’s founders. He said its chief purpose was to combat apathy and to offer equality, respect for the Constitution and stronger Italian institutions as a way to counter hate and Mr. Salvini’s essential themes: opposition to immigration, antagonism toward Europe and heightened security. The Sardines were inspired to organize by Mr. Salvini’s campaign vow to “liberate” the liberal stronghold of Emilia Romagna in regional elections next month. They fear that if Mr. Salvini can win there, he can win anywhere. Italians packed St. John at the Lateran Square on Saturday, holding signs reading “Humanity and Respect” and “Indifference, the Dark Side of Humanity.” Some carried European Union flags. Organizers have sought to characterize the movement as a broad positive public appeal for more civility in politics. But some of the slogans at the rally conveyed a different tone: “The only good fascist is a fried fascist,” one sign read.  And a look around the square made clear that it is as much a specific response to Mr. Salvini and his League party as a broader statement. Eduardo Scirè, 28, milled through the crowd with a box decorated with pictures of sardines, reading “How will we beat Salvini?”  “We need new ideas,” he said as a woman placed a long note in the box. In an interview, Mr. Santori said the Sardines’ goal at this point was not generating specific proposals  but instead creating a grass-roots energy. The movement seeks to bolster an established left-leaning candidate, whoever it might be, against Mr. Salvini’s League party candidate in the Emilia Romagna elections at the end of January.  Mr. Santori said the movement did not want to become a political party, but suggested that wasn’t an impossibility, either. On Sunday, Sardines organizers were planning to meet with local rally organizers from around Italy to better understand the movement and where it might go. Italian political analysts have asked whether the movement’s energy in the piazzas will translate to elections. Mr. Salvini, who was politically sidelined this past summer in an overreach for power, leads Italy’s oldest political party. He has solid support and a sophisticated political operation as he tries for a comeback by picking off traditionally left-leaning regions. In mid-November, Mr. Salvini was set to kick off his party’s campaign in Bologna, the region’s capital, in an arena that held 5,700 people. Mr. Santori sent a message to a few friends to meet the next day.  Over lunch in Bologna, they decided to spread a Facebook invite to a “flash mob” rally at a Bologna square, though without political or party banners. They hoped for 6,000 people. Instead 15,000 showed up. Subsequent rallies packed squares around the region and then the country. In Florence, Turin and elsewhere, Sardines sang an anti-Fascist resistance song, “Bella Ciao,” which has been closely associated with the Italian left for decades. At the rally in Rome on Saturday, young and old alike sang the song repeatedly as Ismail Sylla, a 23-year-old from Mali, marched by with other migrants in a group called “the Black Sardines.” Mr. Sylla said the group hoped for the repeal of Mr. Salvini’s tough Security Decree, a measure approved by Parliament late last year that cracked down on illegal migrants. Asked what he would do if Mr. Salvini returned to power, he said: “I don’t want to hear the question. He is a big problem for us. We suffered so much under him.” The peaceful, respectful tone of the demonstrations has made it hard for Mr. Salvini to deride them with his usual characterizations: as hard-left or elitist elements far removed from the Italian mainstream.  And as the Sardines movement has grown, it has built a metric of support that Mr. Salvini’s operation pays attention to: Mr. Santori’s Facebook page support has ballooned to more than 200,000 followers. Mr. Santori said the left’s communication style was outdated because no one wants to listen to hourlong speeches anymore, especially when Mr. Salvini’s social media operation — called The Beast — pumps out tweets, Facebook Live posts and videos for the TikTok app. “There are people who think you can beat Salvini’s Beast with political rallies from the 1990s; unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way,” he said, adding, “We have to propose an alternative that in some way is cool.” Mr. Salvini, who first mocked the group, writing on Twitter that he liked kittens more because “they eat sardines when hungry,” then shifted to criticizing its lack of proposals. He later expressed appreciation for its democratic impulse, saying, “The more people participate, the better.”  His softening may have something to do with the Sardine-size dent in his poll numbers. Some polls have shown that the Sardines would capture 17 percent of the national electorate if they became a party. But even Mr. Santori acknowledges that the true measure of the movement will come in the Emilia Romagna election. He said that after the Sardines started filling squares, the candidate for the center-left was able to draw supporters to his events. Without the Sardines, he said, “he wouldn’t have done it.”  But recent Italian history has a track record of protest movements that seemed important and then disappeared.  In 2002, as former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi dominated Italian politics, the liberal Ring-Around-the-Rosie protests stood up against the mogul. And then they all fell down.  But then again, some movements took over the country.  Angry demonstrations in 2007 gave birth to the Five Star Movement, which in 2018 won the largest share of national elections. It governed in a coalition with Mr. Salvini’s hard-right League party before switching allegiances to the center-left Democratic party this summer. Mr. Santori rejected any comparisons to the Five Star Movement and its anti-establishment message that reduced the right and the left alike. “There’s a difference,” he said. “At a certain point you have to pick where you stand.”  While the Sardines obviously stand against Mr. Salvini and nationalism, whether the movement will matter ultimately may depend on whether it clarifies what it stands for beyond civility and human rights. “We’ve filled the piazza, mission accomplished,” Mr. Santori told the crowd on Saturday. But close to the stage, where young people sang “Bella Ciao” and “I hate Salvini,” a young man held a key question written on cardboard. “At the ballot box,” it read, “will we stay close and united?”']","A liberal, grass-roots movement aims to support civility, equality and a candidate to undercut Matteo Salvini’s anti-migrant rhetoric."
Brexit Is Going to Get Done. But on Whose Terms?,2019-12-13,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s landslide election victory Thursday clarifies British politics in one important respect: Efforts to reverse the Brexit referendum are now dead. Britain will leave the European Union next month. But on what terms it will do so remains unclear, perhaps even more so in the wake of the election. Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party rode a wave of frustrated working-class voters to a decisive majority in Parliament, radically realigning British politics and reshaping Britain’s oldest party. Crucially, that new coalition of voters may also shape the trade agreement that Mr. Johnson must now negotiate with Europe — and hence, the nature of his Brexit. The voters who gave Mr. Johnson the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher share few of the free-trade or deregulatory instincts of the Brexiteers who masterminded Mr. Johnson’s campaign or filled his last cabinet. These voters want safe jobs, protection from imports and the restoration of a Britain that vanished in the contrails of the global economy. That is worlds away from the agile, economically open, lightly regulated Britain that Mr. Johnson’s Downing Street brain trust envisions — Singapore-on-Thames, to use their preferred marketing slogan. Reconciling those two models will be difficult, if not impossible, even for an ideologically flexible prime minister. “It’s the abiding conundrum of Brexit,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. “The Conservatives have now become the party of those left behind by the forces of globalization while also being the party of free trade. All Boris Johnson has to do is satisfy both.” Mr. Johnson appeared to grasp the challenge. In his ebullient victory speech on Friday morning, the prime minister said he recognized that his new backers across the old Labour heartland in Britain’s Midlands and north were not natural Tories. They are better described as a disaffected rump of Labour Party loyalists, many of whom backed Brexit in 2016 and only “lent” the Conservatives their votes this time around as a way to get the job done. The prime minister promised to govern as a big-tent Conservative, forsaking the austerity of his Tory predecessors in favor of a social democratic-style spending binge, earmarking billions of pounds to bolster Britain’s schools and the National Health Service, hire 20,000 police officers and build vast public works projects. “In winning this election, we have won votes and the trust of people who have never voted Conservative before, and people who have always voted for other parties,” Mr. Johnson told a cheering crowd in suburban London. “Those people want change. We cannot, must not, must not, let them down.” Spending money is likely to be the least of Mr. Johnson’s challenges. He is a political chameleon with few fixed principles and an instinct, honed during his years as the mayor of London, to govern from the center. There is support across the political spectrum for an end to austerity, even at the price of ballooning deficits. But the coming negotiation with Brussels will force him into painful trade-offs that cannot be papered over with promises of more money for schools and hospitals. “Johnson’s entire pitch domestically is the antithesis of Singapore-on-Thames,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “He doesn’t have a mandate to eviscerate regulation, and they’ve never faced that contradiction before.” The Conservative Party has united around a vision of Brexit that would deepen those contradictions by diverging sharply from the European Union. Mr. Johnson’s withdrawal agreement, which will now sail through Parliament, hews to a hard-line version of Brexit, eschewing participation in the European single market or customs union. The idea is for Britain to develop its own free market. Mr. Johnson has until the end of 2020 to hammer out a trade deal with the European Union, an almost impossibly brief time to fashion a bespoke agreement. If he continues to refuse to ask for another extension, as he vowed during the campaign, Britain could yet end up having to trade with Europe on World Trade Organization terms — the equivalent of a no-deal Brexit. Such a scenario, experts said, would devastate Britain’s automakers, not to mention other manufacturing industries. That would reverberate through the industrial strongholds that the Conservatives carried on Thursday.  The new members of Parliament from those districts insist they will be able to curb Mr. Johnson’s worst impulses. “We can hold their feet to the fire,” said Lee Anderson, a Conservative who won a longtime Labour seat in the Midlands district of Ashfield. “A Tory candidate in the south is not a Tory candidate in the north.” That could set up an intraparty battle with an intellectually muscular contingent of Brexiteers who have spent years sharpening their ideas. Some of those people belong to the European Research Group, a hard-line faction that once exerted outsized influence over Mr. Johnson, holding him to his pledge not to extend negotiations with Brussels. In his last government, Mr. Johnson surrounded himself with ministers who codified their free-market, deregulatory principles in a 2012 book, “Britannia Unchained.”  But the election results have changed the dynamic in Parliament. Fortified with a 79-seat majority, Mr. Johnson can now afford to brush aside the hard-line Brexiteers in his party, should he so choose. A major indication of his intentions could come when he shuffles his cabinet after Christmas. If, for example, he replaces ministers like Dominic Raab, a co-author of “Britannia Unchained” and the current foreign secretary, with more centrist figures, it could suggest that Mr. Johnson will pursue a softer Brexit. Mr. Johnson also has to contend with resurgent nationalist movements in Scotland and Northern Ireland, both of which fiercely oppose Brexit and could use that as grounds to break away from the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists won more seats in Westminster than the pro-Britain unionists of Northern Ireland did. A vocal proponent of Brexit, Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party, lost his seat. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party won 48 of 59 seats, leading the party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, to demand powers to call another referendum on Scottish independence. The prime minister could be swayed as well by the fact that, however resounding his parliamentary victory, Britain remains deeply divided about Brexit. Indeed, parties that either oppose Brexit or want to rethink Britain’s departure won 52 percent of the total votes cast, while the Conservatives and other pro-Brexit parties won only 46 percent. For the hundreds of thousands who thronged the streets of London to demand a second referendum, this election will be a bitter pill to swallow. Although the groups that campaigned for a do-over never found a narrative to counter Mr. Johnson’s call to “Get Brexit Done,” they are likely to mutate into some kind of “rejoin movement” that will continue to agitate. Some analysts, however, are skeptical that Mr. Johnson will reverse course on Brexit. For one, agreeing to a closer alignment with the European Union would impose economic costs on Britain that would make it politically unpalatable for the Conservative Party. Moreover, Mr. Johnson is unlikely to pick a fight with his party’s establishment. “Boris is part of the establishment,” Mr. Wright of Brookings said, “and Brexit is largely a Conservative establishment project.” In his victory speech, Mr. Johnson voiced little sympathy for those who pined for a second referendum. “This election means that getting Brexit done is now the irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people,” he declared. “I think we’ve put an end to all those miserable threats of a second referendum.” Still, while Mr. Johnson made it clear what he is against, he has not clarified exactly what he is for when it comes to Brexit. “We don’t know what he wants, which is remarkable after such a hard-fought election,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London.']",Boris Johnson’s victory has drawn in millions of former Labour voters whose vision of Brexit is far different from the Conservative establishment’s. 
"For African Migrants, Hope and a Home in a Vacant French School",2019-12-14,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['LYON, France — From their villages and towns in West Africa, the squatters had crossed deserts, seas and mountains to arrive in Lyon, most of them for no specific reason. The next bus was headed to Lyon, one explained. As France’s third-largest city, Lyon didn’t seem as intimidating as Paris, another said. A fellow migrant, befriended in a camp in Italy, sent over a WhatsApp message about a place to stay, yet another recounted. But for Sidi Koné, the reason was Lyon’s soccer team. He had always been a fan in his village in Mali, now overrun by Islamic extremists and bandits. France, the former colonial ruler, had always seemed familiar, almost like “family” — and “not unjust.” Two years later, Mr. Koné, 27, is squatting with 450 other men from Africa in a vacant school building that has become a crucible of the continent’s hopes, problems and complex feelings toward France. With another winter almost here, the migrants are in limbo in a city that wants to expel them, in a country that is losing its patience and on a continent that has already lost it. “But my mother is happy I’m here,” Mr. Koné said. “Over there, it’s life and death.” Thousands of migrants from Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe are now in makeshift shelters across France, in abandoned schools, convents, tents and, in the case of hundreds of Tibetans, in a forest not far from Paris. France recently overtook Germany as Europe’s leading destination for asylum-seekers and is now on track to receive a record number of applications this year, in what experts say is a ripple effect of the migrant crisis. The previous record — 124,000 applications — was set last year, and amounted to a 23 percent jump from the year before.  Applications in France have spiked even as the flow of migrants to Europe has slowed since reaching a peak in 2015 from the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Though Europe has tried to stem migration from sub-Saharan Africa through development aid and other programs, many migrants from the continent — fleeing local conflicts or pursuing economic opportunities — continue to arrive by sticking to routes that have been used for decades. France has also become what experts describe as a “rebound” destination. Applicants who had been rejected for asylum in another European country are trying again in France.  Gérard Sadik, an asylum expert at La Cimade, a migrants rights group, said that Europe’s lack of a “supranational asylum process” encouraged applicants to waste years before finding a country that will accept them, or before they are finally sent back home. France has increased available housing for asylum-seekers in recent years. But in early November it announced get-tough measures, including restricting asylum-seekers’ access to non-urgent health care and the use of a daily stipend of about $8.20 for those not provided with lodging.  President Emmanuel Macron — a centrist who has tacked right in a move to wrest the volatile issue of immigration from his main political rival, the far-right National Rally — recently told a right-wing magazine that his “goal is to throw out everybody who has no reason to be here.” In Lyon, the metropolitan government, which has been trying to expel the squatters from the school building, is appealing a recent court ruling allowing them to stay until next September. Today, some 450 young, single men sleep jammed inside the school’s classrooms and manage the premises — ensuring security, cleaning and making dinner with supplies provided by the city. Most are from France’s former colonies in West Africa, though there is a growing minority from the region’s former British colonies. If the squatters rediscovered the natural solidarity often found across Africa, they also faced a lack of unity, corruption, suspicions and tensions — between different ethnic groups, as well as between Anglophones and Francophones, some of whom resorted to communicating in the broken Italian they had picked up on their long journeys to Lyon. “I’ve learned so much about the problems of Africa by being here,” said Ibrahim Koné, 18, a Malian and migrant leader who presides over a weekly meeting with French supporters. “It’s difficult to come to any decisions because many of the people here, like our leaders back in Africa, just want to give orders and aren’t interested in democracy.” Mr. Koné, who is not related to Sidi Koné, said that many people suspected the migrant leaders of pocketing benefits from the French, adding that sometimes suspicion was justified. The key to the supply room had been changed, he said, because of pilfering. On a recent rainy morning, a group of Anglophone men shared a smoke under a shelter in the courtyard. They accused their fellow Francophone migrants of being too close to the French and of failing to aggressively plead their case to the authorities. “These people were colonized by French people, who gave them the worst syllabuses, poor education,” said Sam Amoako, a migrant from Ghana. “You see this illiterate?” he snapped when a French speaker from Ivory Coast dropped by and started complaining about the living conditions without first greeting the Anglophones. “No bonjour?” It all began in September 2018 when Ghassen Zaghdoud, a longtime housing activist in Lyon, set his sights on a secondary school that had closed in 2013, Maurice-Scève.  Mr. Zaghdoud, who had spent years taking over vacant public buildings to house the homeless, said the premises seemed perfect for the young African migrants he had noticed sleeping in a nearby park. When he began occupying the school with about 50 Africans, Mr. Zaghdoud said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the neighbors’ reaction. Within days, the squatters had more than enough food, mattresses and other donations. “I’ve never had as much support from neighbors in the 20 years that I’ve been squatting,” Mr. Zaghdoud said. The Africans found themselves in Croix-Rousse, a hilly neighborhood away from the center of Lyon. Once the site of the city’s silk-weaving industry, Croix-Rousse is now a gentrifying, sought-after neighborhood with restaurants catering to a “bobo,” or bohemian bourgeois, clientele. Sébastien Gervais, a high school math teacher who moved to Croix-Rousse two decades ago, became involved in a group that supports the squatters and has fought efforts by the city to expel them. To Mr. Gervais, France has a responsibility to take care of the squatters, especially because they hail from former colonies where the French still exercise great economic, political and military influence. “Some of them say they’re here because France exploits their countries,” Mr. Gervais said, “and I think they’re right.” Lyon’s metropolitan government, which owns the school property, wants to expel the squatters and use the land for a condominium project that would include a share of low-cost housing, said Pascal Isoard-Thomas, who oversees social affairs for Lyon. The city, which is legally responsible for housing migrants who are minors, relocated squatters recognized as non-adults to public housing. But because adult asylum-seekers are the responsibility of the French government, the city is seeking to expel the remaining squatters from the school, Mr. Isoard-Thomas said, adding that the city’s role was now limited to being “the owner of the property.” No former colonial power has kept as big a footprint in Africa as France has. Today, seven decades after the independence of its African colonies, French businesses dominate in the region, where most points of reference remain French. France backs a common currency used there, and 4,500 of its soldiers are fighting against Islamic extremism in five former colonies in the Sahel. For many of the migrants, France had loomed over them since their earliest days in kindergarten, an ineffable presence that both repelled and drew them. “It was the country that colonized us, but they have this motto — liberty, equality and fraternity — which means a lot,” said Mamadou Sow, a Guinean who grew up in Ivory Coast. “I thought they didn’t give it to us in Africa, but that I’d find it here, and that’s why I came.” “But I’m here, and I don’t see it,” Mr. Sow added. “I’m an asylum-seeker but they won’t house me. It starts with that.” Others, like Alpha Sow, 24, a Gambian who is not related, drew a distinction between a nation and continent that did not want them, and the local French supporters in Lyon. Impoverished farmers, his parents sent him at an early age to neighboring Senegal where he begged for years on the streets as a Quranic student, or talibé, for a religious leader. On an annual visit home in his late teens, a fire he set to his family’s plot to keep it fertile accidentally spread out of control, destroying neighbors’ crops and livestock, he said. Fearing for his son’s life, his father urged him to flee to Europe. So began a six-year odyssey that took him across the Sahara on a well-established smuggling route, where a pickup truck in his convoy broke down and left a dozen migrants to die in the desert; nine months struggling to survive in Libya; a boat across the Mediterranean to Italy where he spent three years in a camp; and, after his asylum request was rejected in Italy, a trek across the Alps into France. He was aware that France was closing the door on people like him, but he held out hope by pointing to the local French, who had given the migrants pots, cups, spoons, taken them in their cars to hospitals, provided French lessons and helped them arrange appointments with French bureaucrats. “I don’t know what they want from us, I don’t know what they want to do tomorrow, why they are coming, I don’t know,” Mr. Sow said, speaking on the edge of his bed in a tiny room inside the school. “But right now, I can say, alhamdulillah, they are good, and if I see them, all I can say is, ‘Thanks, brother, thanks.’ ” Mélissa Godin contributed reporting in Paris.']","With a record number of asylum seekers, France is getting tough on immigration.

"For Scotland and Northern Ireland, a Weakening of Ties",2019-12-13,By Ceylan Yeginsu and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — While voters across England embraced Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party, it was a different story in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where Thursday’s electoral earthquake has strained the ties that bind the United Kingdom and increased the risk of its eventual breakup.  In Scotland a constitutional crisis looms after the dominant Scottish National Party made significant gains, winning 48 of 59 seats, and said it would press its demands for a second independence referendum — something that Mr. Johnson has already rejected. The background in Northern Ireland is more complicated. But for the first time in its history, the territory elected more nationalist members of Parliament, who support reunification with the Republic of Ireland, than unionists, who wish to remain a part of the United Kingdom. Though the situations are quite different in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the common thread is Brexit, a project supported by English and Welsh voters but opposed by majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the 2016 Brexit referendum. “Brexit has completely transformed the debate in Northern Ireland,” said Daniel Keohane, an Irish political analyst. “Before Brexit, no one seriously thought a united Ireland would happen anytime soon. Now it’s a very real prospect based on these results.” In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, who leads the anti-Brexit Scottish National Party, said that it was “now clear beyond any doubt that an overwhelming majority of people in Scotland do want to remain in the European Union.” Then she demanded a repeat of the 2014 referendum in which Scots voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. This was, she added, an “assertion of the democratic right of the people of Scotland to determine our own future.” Such claims are unlikely to move Mr. Johnson, putting him and Ms. Sturgeon on a collision course. On Friday after a phone call between the two leaders, Mr. Johnson issued a statement saying that he had made clear to Ms. Sturgeon how he “remained opposed to a second independence referendum,” adding that the result of the 2014 vote “was decisive and should be respected.” But the reality is that the politics of England and Scotland seem to be diverging. So while Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won a landslide overall, they lost seven of their 13 Scottish seats despite their hopes that campaigning against Scottish independence might save them. The main British opposition party, Labour, which once dominated Scottish politics, now holds just one seat there. Removal from the European Union against its will is likely to feed a sense of resentment in Scotland, especially if Mr. Johnson’s Brexit plan proves as economically harmful as many expect. In Northern Ireland it was a sobering night for the party that had championed Brexit there, the hard line Democratic Unionist Party. Its leader, Nigel Dodds, lost his parliament seat in Belfast North.  The Democratic Unionist Party had propped up the minority Conservative government since 2017, and ultimately felt betrayed when Mr. Johnson struck a new Brexit deal that leaves Northern Ireland linked closely to the European Union’s customs market, effectively severing it economically from the rest of the United Kingdom and putting a new border in the Irish Sea.  But an even more striking shift in Northern Ireland’s political trajectory, analysts say, is the startling support won by the centralist Alliance Party, which gained 8.8 percentage points in Thursday’s general election, more than any other party. Unlike the territory’s main unionist and nationalist political parties, whose policies are mainly defined by sectarianism, the Alliance Party is neutral and has come to represent progressive and moderate politics across all communities. “The real story of the night is the Alliance Party in the middle, which is now our third-largest party,” said Newton Emerson, a political commentator in Northern Ireland, who describes himself as a “liberal unionist.” “The big change we have seen in Northern Ireland is that we now have a three-community system.” He said the troubled governance system created by the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 pact that halted decades of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland, “now has a third leg on the stool.” Frustrated by the political deadlock between unionists and nationalists that led to the collapse of the region’s governing assembly more than three years ago, many voters supported the Alliance Party, hoping that an electoral sting for the main parties would force them to revive the local power-sharing government. “The political paralysis has had great consequences,” said Marie Kelly, a trainee nurse, who voted for the Alliance Party in Belfast. “Our health system is collapsing, we just don’t have the resources and deprived areas are suffering so so badly.” Ms. Kelly, who previously voted for the Democratic Unionist Party, said she had wanted to punish it for focusing on Brexit alone and ignoring other important problems. “We need a more neutral political representation that prioritizes issues over ideologies.” Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of the Alliance Party, who won in the Belfast constituency of North Down that the Democratic Unionists had been favored to win, said his victory was tied to the values of “moderation, rationalism and inclusion.” The biggest disappointment in the election was felt by unionists and loyalists who vehemently oppose Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new Brexit deal. The unionists view the deal as a betrayal because it would require checks on goods flowing across the Irish Sea, effectively cleaving Northern Ireland economically from the rest of the United Kingdom. “The poll clearly creates the expectation that Boris Johnson will try to force the Betrayal Act through Parliament,” said Jamie Bryson, a prominent unionist activist who is challenging the Brexit agreement in court. “The unionist-loyalist community have been clear. An economic United Ireland will never be tolerated.” Senior members of the community insist that the deal breaches the consent mechanism of the Good Friday Agreement, which eased the legacy of bitterness between Protestant unionists and the Catholic republicans, who want Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland. The new Brexit arrangement, they say, threatens to inflame sectarian tensions. “If the political process has been exhausted then potentially, we could face some very dark days ahead,” Mr. Bryson said. “And that’s obviously something everyone wants to avoid.” Mr. Keohane says it is understandable that unionists are upset about the customs arrangement because it will be more intrusive than most people wanted, but at the same time he said it is hard to imagine them attacking their own state. “Of course, there will be some loyalists who will make a lot of noise about it. I don’t blame unionists for being upset,” Mr. Keohane said. “they have been betrayed by Boris Johnson, it’s as simple as that.”']","Both strongly opposed Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan. With that now a certainty, independence is in the air, particularly in Scotland."
At Least 23 Soldiers Killed in Insider Attack in Afghanistan,2019-12-14,By Fahim Abed,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 23 soldiers were killed while they were sleeping on Saturday in an insider attack in eastern Afghanistan, officials said, the latest episode of enemy infiltration that has raised concerns about a new local military force billed as the hope for holding territory recaptured from the Taliban. The Taliban infiltrator, who was on duty at a military base in Ghazni Province, opened fire on his colleagues, wiping out almost the whole unit, officials said. The attacker then seized all weapons and equipment in the base and joined the insurgency. The exact number of casualties was unclear. The Afghan Ministry of Defense confirmed the death of nine soldiers, and the Taliban said 32 had been killed, but their claims of casualties are mostly exaggerated. The figure of 23 came from Esmatullah Jamuradwal, a member of the provincial council, who said that only one soldier, out of 24 in the Territorial Army unit, had survived. “The attacker packed all weapons and ammunition in a Humvee and drove to the Taliban,” he said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said that officials had begun an investigation into the attack. This was the second deadly attack by an infiltrator in the Territorial Army in the Qara Bagh District of Ghazni. In July, Col. Abdul Mobin Mohabati, the commander of the Afghan Army forces in the provinces, was killed by such an infiltrator. This past week, as Taliban negotiators resumed peace talks with American diplomats, militants set off a car bomb and penetrated a medical facility attached to Bagram Air Base, killing at least two people and wounding at least 73. But civilians continue to be the main victims of Afghanistan’s nearly two-decade war. On Friday, 10 were killed and six others wounded when a roadside bomb placed by the Taliban hit a shuttle bus in the Jaghatu District of Ghazni, officials said. The latest insider attack has raised doubts about the Afghan Territorial Army, through which the government hopes to hold areas they had retaken from the Taliban. Members of the Territorial Army are local people trained by the regular Afghan Army. The screening process is less strict than for the regular army, and the local force is seen as cheaper to maintain since those who sign up don’t need the same logistics and supplies as members of the regular army.  According to defense officials, close to 7,000 members of the Territorial Army have been recruited and trained, mostly in volatile areas where the Afghan government had made territorial gains. Battlefield gains are particularly important this fighting season in order for both sides to get more leverage at the negotiation table. After Afghan forces push back the Taliban from certain areas, they have always struggled to hold the recently cleared territory.  The recent round of talks between the chief United States peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, and Taliban representatives in Doha, the Qatari capital, had tackled decreasing the violence, a possible cease-fire and paving a path for talks between insurgents and the Afghan government. But the talks were paused on Friday after five days so that the Taliban negotiators could consult with their leaders.  President Trump abruptly called off peace talks in September, after a Taliban attack. He announced the resumption of negotiations in November, during his first visit to Afghanistan. Mr. Trump said the Taliban were interested in a cease-fire, but his remarks appeared to catch the militants off guard. Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.

"Exposed as Stasi Spy, a Newspaper Owner Tries to Reclaim His Story",2019-12-15,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — When a wealthy married couple bought the Berliner Zeitung, a distinguished but ailing survivor of the East German press, they timed their newspaper’s big revamp for the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall last month. In an attention-grabbing two-page editorial, the entrepreneurial couple, Silke and Holger Friedrich, urged a reimagining of history since German reunification. They argued that 30 years after the wall came down, East Germans should wrest back control of their own narrative from the West, and stirred controversy by defending the last East German leader. But there was an essential piece of information that they left out. A week later, a rival newspaper reported that Mr. Friedrich, 53, had been an informant for the Stasi, the feared secret police of Communist East Germany in the late 1980s.  Instead of apologizing, Mr. Friedrich chose to come out fighting. He argued that he was coerced into being an informant and that he worked with his supposed victims to ensure that he disclosed little of value. He insisted that he has little, if anything, to be sorry for. But at the same time, he acknowledged that he could not be sure whether anyone was harmed as a result of his actions. “I’m not an Easterner who has to apologize. I’m not an Easterner who needs to grovel,” he said in an interview at his newspaper’s offices. In the hope of telling his side of the story, Mr. Friedrich granted access to his copy of his Stasi files to The New York Times and The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. He also had the former head of the Stasi Archives and a historian write an official report on his files.  In their report, the archivist and the historian verified the authenticity of the files, although they noted that there was no way of knowing whether the hundreds of pages represented all that the Stasi ever had on him. The case reflects the debate within Germany over the legacy of the Stasi and those who collaborated with it and how some perceptions are evolving.  In its final throes, the Stasi used an estimated 189,000 informants to help maintain its grip on a Communist state of about 16 million. It was a source of terror in East Germany and of deep shame after its fall. But in recent years, many Germans have taken a more nuanced view of those who collaborated with the secret police as it has become clearer that many of them were blackmailed or otherwise coerced.  “People are more willing to discuss the ambiguities surrounding those individuals who were acting as informers,” said Ned Richardson-Little, a historian at the University of Erfurt, in the former East Germany. These changing perceptions have also been reflected in popular culture. In 2006 the Academy Award-winning film “The Lives of Others” focused on the Stasi’s coldhearted methods. But last year, the film “Gundermann” was somewhat sympathetic in its portrayal of a real-life story of a Stasi informant, a coal miner turned popular singer. It won national awards and drew large audiences in the east in particular.  Mr. Friedrich’s file has more than 700 pages, more than 500 of them related to surveillance of him, rather than by him.  He was eventually dropped by his Stasi handlers, who noted in his file that he was proving unproductive. The extensive report by Marianne Birthler, a former head of the Stasi archives, and the historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk, noted that even if Mr. Friedrich was trying to avoid harming others, there is no way to be certain that he didn’t.  Asked why he had not disclosed his Stasi past earlier, Mr. Friedrich said, “We felt it was better to get the business going before this came out to be better able deal with it.”  His interactions with the Stasi began after he joined the East German Army in 1986. In 1987, after being arrested on suspicion of planning to flee the country and held in a Stasi facility, he was given a choice between prison or collaboration.  “It didn’t take me 30 seconds to make up my mind,” Mr. Friedrich said in the interview, adding that he had always been honest with his family and friends about his involvement.  In Mr. Friedrich’s file, it said his handlers instructed him to befriend several specific people. But he appeared to have returned with little valuable intelligence.  The storm around Mr. Friedrich’s Stasi file has become a public spectacle. It capped a turbulent introduction to public life for a couple who were little known until it was announced that they had bought the Berliner Verlag newspaper group, which publishes the Berliner Zeitung and several smaller titles. Mr. Friedrich made his money in tech in the past decade or two, including a stint at the consulting firm McKinsey, and Ms. Friedrich founded an English-German private school in Berlin. They promised to bring technological and business expertise to bear on reviving the newspaper company. Its titles retain only a small fraction of the combined 2.5 million circulation that they claimed before the wall fell. But several missteps brought controversy in the following weeks.  In one instance, they ran a glowing article on a business which Mr. Friedrich owned a stake in without noting the connection.  Still, the Friedrichs’ purchase of Berliner Verlag, for a price that is not publicly known, made it the only major newspaper publishing house in Germany in the hands of independent Easterners.  Their debut editorial attacked the bedrock of the official German narrative about the fall of the wall on Nov. 9. 1989 and reunification. For example, the couple suggested that keeping President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia closer to Germany might have been a wise move. But it was another remark that provoked more intense controversy. They suggested that East Germany’s last dictator, Egon Krenz — who was part of efforts to repress the peaceful revolution of the 1980s — should be thanked for not violently cracking down on protesters.  While some said they went too far, others welcomed the call for a rethink. “I might not share his opinions, but it’s about the question of who has the authority to interpret East German history and the history of the fall of the wall, and that is justified,” said Mandy Tröger, who teaches media and communication at the University of Munich. “Especially if you look at conventional media narratives, this op-ed can be seen as an act of emancipation.” Robert Ide, the managing editor of the paper’s biggest local competitor, the Berliner Tagesspiegel, said that as an East German and a senior editor, “I think it’s really a good thing that the Berliner Zeitung is being revived with new impulses.” Mr. Ide, who was 14 when the wall fell, did not criticize Mr. Friedrich for his actions as a young soldier —\xa0but he was less indulgent of Mr. Friedrich’s decisions as a rookie media owner. “We can’t presume to know how we would have acted under those circumstances, but we can ask ourselves how would we have dealt with it today as publishers,” Mr. Ide said. “He could have come out with it on the 9th of November, and it could have been part of that new frank discussion.”']","An entrepreneur took over a venerable Berlin daily, saying he wanted a new conversation about East Germany.

Greta Thunberg Is Taking a Holiday Break. ‘You Need to Take Rest.’,2019-12-15,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Greta Thunberg says she needs a break. The seemingly tireless 16-year-old climate activist — who has sailed across the Atlantic twice as she has become the most prominent face in the movement to fight global warming, and lectured the world’s leaders that they were not doing enough to address the problem — recently told reporters in Spain:  “I will be home for Christmas and then I will take a holiday break because you need to take rest. Otherwise you cannot do this all the time.” The activist, who last week was named by Time magazine as its person of the year, has faced attacks from the far right, as well as from the president of the United States and other adults who find her intense and her message that the world is facing a crisis unsettling. Now others have weighed in, including a German railway company. President Trump, who was Time magazine’s person of the year in 2016, called this year’s choice “ridiculous” on Twitter. He urged Ms. Thunberg to “work on her anger management problem” and to “chill.”  The Trump campaign also distributed a Photoshopped image of the Time cover with the president’s head superimposed on the teenager’s body. Earlier in the week, Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right president, referred to her as a “brat,” Reuters reported.  Ms. Thunberg also came under criticism last week when she joined thousands of students in the north Italian city of Turin on Friday to pressure the government to take action on carbon emissions. She had just been in Madrid for a United Nations climate conference. While addressing the climate protest, Ms. Thunberg called on crowds to “put leaders against the wall,” according to the BBC.  Critics scolded that she was advocating violence, leading her to apologize and explain that the true meaning of her words had been lost in translation. On Saturday, she said that she was “against any form of violence,” and that her remark had been nothing more than an unfortunate translation of an expression meaning “to hold someone accountable” in her native Swedish.  Then on Sunday, she posted a photo on Twitter that showed her sitting next to her packed suitcases on the floor of a German train that she described as “overcrowded.” The German railway company appeared to take umbrage, first thanking her on Twitter “for supporting us railroad workers in the fight against climate change!” but adding, “It would have been even nicer if you had also reported how friendly and competent you were looked after by our team at your seat in first class.” In a follow-up tweet, she explained that the train she had taken from Basel, a city in northwestern Switzerland, had been “taken out of traffic.”  “So we sat on the floor on 2 different trains,” she said, adding that she got a seat after Göttingen, a German town. “Overcrowded trains is a great sign because it means the demand for train travel is high!” she wrote.  Ms. Thunberg emerged on the world stage last year, when she started skipping school to protest climate change outside the Swedish Parliament in August 2018.  Refusing to fly because of the outsize greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, she traveled across the Atlantic on an emissions-free yacht to make a fiery speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York in September this year. Then in November she set sail from Hampton, Va., to Spain for the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference. This month, the Oscar-nominated director Darren Aronofsky called her “the icon the planet desperately needs” in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times.  After Mr. Trump’s mocking tweet this week, Ms. Thunberg changed her Twitter bio to identify herself as: “A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.” Prominent figures also came to her defense. “What kind of president bullies a teenager?” Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a Democratic presidential hopeful, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. He added that the president “could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader.” Michelle Obama, the former first lady, also weighed in, telling Ms. Thunberg to not let “anyone dim her light.”  “Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on,” she wrote.

There Are No Children Here. Just Lots of Life-Size Dolls.,2019-12-17,By Motoko Rich and Nadia Shira Cohen,"['NAGORO, Japan — The last children were born in the remote mountain village of Nagoro 18 years ago. Now, just over two dozen adults live in this outpost straddling a river on the Japanese island of Shikoku. The elementary school closed its doors in 2012, shortly after the last two students completed sixth grade. But on a recent bright autumn Sunday, Tsukimi Ayano brought the school back to life. It just so happened that she did it with dolls rather than humans. Ms. Ayano, 70, had arrayed more than 40 handmade dolls in a lifelike tableau on the grounds of the shuttered school. Recreating a school sports day known as “undokai,” a staple of the Japanese calendar, she had posed child-size dolls in a footrace, perched on a swing set and tossing balls. “We never see children here anymore,” said Ms. Ayano, who was born in Nagoro, and has staged an annual doll festival for the last seven years. “I wish there were more children because it would be more cheerful,” she said. “So I made the children.” Japan’s population is shrinking and aging, and nowhere is the trend felt more intensively than in its rural regions, where a low birthrate is exacerbated by dwindling employment opportunities and an inconvenient lifestyle.  “There are no chances for young people here,” said Ms. Ayano, who remembers when the village had a medical clinic, a pachinko gambling parlor and a diner. Now, Nagoro does not have even one shop. “They can’t make a living.” Some 350 dolls made by Ms. Ayano and her friends outnumber the human residents by more than 10 to 1. All around Nagoro, she has staged the dolls — made of wood and wire frames, stuffed with newspapers and dressed in old clothes donated from across Japan — in various scenes evoking the real people who once populated the village. An old woman tends a roadside grave, while another rests in a wheelchair. Construction workers smoke cigarettes on break while others wait at the bus stop. A father pulls a wagon full of children. A mischief maker shakes chestnuts from a tree. Inside the school, dolls loiter on the stairwells or sit at desks in front of teachers giving eternal lessons. Ms. Ayano has a playful touch, giving many of her dolls an impish mien. The overall effect, of a town dominated by dolls, is not as eerie as it might initially sound. “I don’t think it’s creepy,” said Fanny Raynaud, 38, a nurse from France who was traveling through Japan on a motorcycle with her husband, Chris Monnon, 55. They stopped in Nagoro after reading about the dolls on a travel blog.  “I think it is a beautiful way to make the village alive again,” Ms. Raynaud said. Another visitor scrawled a more pointed message on a chalkboard in one of the school’s classrooms: “Where are the living?” Nagoro, which sits in what is known as the Iya Valley surrounded by vast mountainsides blanketed by cedar trees, was never a big place. Even when Ms. Ayano was a child, the population was only about 300. Shikoku is by far the smallest and least populated of Japan’s four main islands.  During the 1950s and ’60s, the region was fueled by forestry, road construction and dam building for hydroelectric plants. Once the dams were built, many people left. Those who stayed operate their own pumps to bring water to grow their own vegetables. To get to a supermarket or the nearest hospital, Nagoro’s residents drive an hour and a half along narrow, winding roads. “You have to really like mountain living,” said Tatsuya Matsuura, who at 38 is the youngest resident of Nagoro. “I think a lot of people would have trouble living here.” Mr. Matsuura is the third generation of his family to operate a guesthouse for hikers on Mt. Tsurugi, about six miles up the road from Nagoro. Three years ago, as business dwindled to nothing, the family shut down a general store and inn in Nagoro.  “If we continue on the path we have taken for the last 10 or 20 years, rural areas will continue to shrink and people will continue to concentrate in the cities,” said Hiroya Masuda, a professor at the University of Tokyo and a former governor of Iwate, in northern Japan. “Many communities will eventually vanish.” Nagoro is one of several hamlets consolidated into a municipal area where more than 40 percent of the residents are 65 or older. Even with child care subsidies, discounted medical bills and housing support, the area has little luck attracting new residents or luring back adults who were born in the region. The local government merged several schools together and spent more than $8 million on a spacious new set of buildings. Just 38 students are enrolled in the entire school. Most students travel to bigger towns for high school, and leave the region altogether for college or work.  “We want them to choose the life they want,” said Hiromi Mukai, principal of Higashi-Iya Elementary and Middle School. “It is unavoidable.” Ms. Ayano, the eldest of four siblings, moved out of Nagoro at age 12 when her father took a job at a food company in Osaka, Japan’s third largest city. She met and married her husband and raised two children with him there. After retiring, her father returned to Nagoro to help take care of his ailing father-in-law and to nurse his wife through kidney failure. Sixteen years ago, Ms. Ayano returned to the village to look after her father, 90, and Nagoro’s oldest resident. In the field in front of their home, she planted a few radish and pea seeds. Birds dug them out, so she made a scarecrow, fashioning it in her father’s likeness. “It looked like a real human, not a conventional scarecrow,” Ms. Ayano said. “That is why it really worked.” She added three or four dolls in the shape of women weeding the field and others on the side of the road. When a few travelers passing through asked some of the dolls for directions, Ms. Ayano was so amused that she started making them full time. She now gives occasional doll-making lessons in a nearby town or to visitors to her studio, set up in the village’s old nursery school. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Ayano showed a group of women who had driven 60 miles from Tosa City how to create an angry or benevolent expression by angling fabric in different directions to make eyebrows. Extra stitching could denote cheekbones or the creases of age. Sometimes she takes custom orders from around Japan. A doctor whose wife died of cancer asked for two replicas of his spouse, one to keep in the living room and another for his bedroom. Ms. Ayano keeps a doll modeled after her grandmother in the passenger seat of her car. When driving the hour and a half to the grocery store, she said, “I’m never lonely.” The day before the recreated sports festival at the old school, Ms. Ayano staged various scenes with the help of a group of college volunteers, as well as a few other villagers and her sister and brother-in-law, who had come from Kyushu in southern Japan. Up until dark, Ms. Ayano meticulously stitched arms, hair and clothing into place. After an overnight rain, she was up before dawn, refreshing her work. By the time the festival opened, the sun emerged. Residents set up food stalls serving soba noodles, fried potatoes and octopus balls. Osamu Tsuzuki, 73, the owner of a local construction firm, gave a welcoming speech. “On behalf of staff, villagers and more than 300 dolls,” he said, “we have all been waiting for you.” A few children showed up from nearby towns or were visiting grandparents.  During a tug of war, people joined dolls whose hands Ms. Ayano had sewn to the rope. There were not enough human children, so competitors in their 80s gave it their all. After a footrace, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, 82, a resident of a nursing home down the mountain, stroked the cheek of a doll in one of the running lanes.  “She is so cute,” said Mr. Yamamoto, a retired road maintenance worker. “I wanted to talk to her.” Kayoko Motokawa, 67, grandmother of a toddler who resembled a doll himself, said it was sad that Nagoro was now known for dolls rather than its people.  “If these were real humans,” said Ms. Motokawa, taking in the festivities, “this would be a truly happy place.” Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']","As Japan’s population shrinks and ages, rural areas are emptying out.

Estonia Apologizes After Minister Calls Finland’s Leader a ‘Sales Girl’,2019-12-17,By Megan Specia,"['Estonia’s leaders have apologized after the country’s interior minister called the new prime minister of neighboring Finland, Sanna Marin, “a sales girl.” The interior minister, Mart Helme, 70, who is the leader of the far-right Estonian Conservative People’s Party, made the comment about Ms. Marin, who is 34, during a Sunday morning radio talk show as part of a larger tirade against the center-left government of Finland, which he said was trying to destroy the country from within.  “Now we can see that a sales girl has become prime minister and some other street activist and uneducated person has also become a member of the government,” Mr. Helme said, according to a translation from Finland’s state broadcaster YLE. He claimed that Finland was led by “Reds” who “are now desperately trying to liquidate Finland, making it a Euro-province.” Ms. Marin has spoken with pride about her working-class roots and about her rise from a low-income household to become the world’s youngest national leader. On Monday, she responded indirectly, on Twitter, to Mr. Helme’s comment.  “I am extremely proud of Finland,” she wrote. “Here, a child from a poor family can get educated and achieve many things in their lives. The cashier of a shop can become a prime minister.” The insult drew an immediate response from others within the Estonian government, who scrambled to control the fallout. President Kersti Kaljulaid called her Finnish counterpart to apologize for the remarks on Monday, according to the Finnish state broadcaster, and Prime Minister Juri Ratas of Estonia wrote on Facebook that he had called Ms. Marin to say sorry.  Finland and Estonia share close cultural and linguistic ties, and also share a common neighbor in Russia, whose influence they have worked to oppose in the region.  Ms. Kaljulaid said in an interview with Postimees, an Estonian newspaper, that she felt Mr. Helme was a threat to the country’s security and feared his comments could alienate an important partner in the region.  “All of this affects our security network,” she said. “The survival of a small country, especially in a geopolitically active region, depends very much on what kinds of partners and allies we have and how they see us, similar or different.” Mr. Ratas, who leads a center-right coalition government, wrote in his Facebook post of the “shared respect and agreement” between the two nations. “We now need to put this behind us and move forward with important issues to the Estonian and Finnish governments, in our countries and in the European Union,” he added. Several members of the opposition called for Mr. Helme to step down from government, and they attempted a vote of no confidence against the minister on Tuesday, though the effort ultimately failed.  “Mart Helme’s statements undermine Estonia’s international reputation,” Kaja Kallas, head of the Reform Party and leader of the opposition, said in a statement, according to the country’s state broadcaster.  “And this is no longer an internal political fight, but rather a situation that is shaming Estonia in general,” she added. Mr. Helme offered his own apology of sorts, but maintained that his words were misinterpreted, the state broadcaster reported. “That specific sentence about the Finnish prime minister, which you have interpreted as demeaning,” Mr. Helme said to reporters after a government meeting on Monday, “I have actually interpreted as complimentary — as recognition that someone can work their way up from a low social standing to the peak of politics.”  Ms. Marin became the world’s youngest prime minister last week, when her Social Democratic Party chose her to head a coalition government led by women. Four of the five women serving in the top government posts, including Ms. Marin, are under 35.  Ms. Marin was selected after a turbulent time that saw Prime Minister Antti Rinne resign over criticism from within the coalition of the handling of a postal workers’ strike.  The shift in leadership thrust Ms. Marin into the international spotlight, but she has waved away the focus on her age and instead emphasized her policy plans.  Mr. Rinne remains the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, but Ms. Marin is expected to challenge him for the party leadership at its convention this summer. She first entered Parliament in 2015 and previously served as the minister of transport and communications. She is seen as left-leaning even within her party, with human rights, climate change and social welfare at the top of her political agenda. While many on the left have applauded her appointment to prime minister as a symbol of growing gender and age equity in Finnish politics, it comes at an especially polarized time in the country.  In elections in April, the Social Democrats only narrowly edged out the right-wing, populist Finns Party.

U.K. Plans to Pass Anti-B.D.S. Law,2019-12-16,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Britain’s newly elected Conservative government plans to ban local authorities from taking part in the boycott-Israel movement, a British official said, following the lead of American officials who have also sought to clamp down on the campaign to pressure Israel to change its policies toward the Palestinians. In his party’s pre-election manifesto last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain mentioned the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or B.D.S., as one of a number of things that “undermine community cohesion.” As a result, the manifesto said, “We will ban public bodies from imposing their own direct or indirect boycotts, disinvestment or sanctions campaigns against foreign countries.” Mr. Johnson is expected to announce the anti-boycott proposal during the ceremonial launch of his agenda on Thursday, when Queen Elizabeth II will read a speech prepared by his government as part of the formal opening of Parliament, British news outlets reported this week. Lord Eric Pickles, Britain’s special envoy for post-Holocaust issues, said at a conference in Jerusalem on Sunday that the law would bar public bodies from working with groups that boycott Israel, news outlets in Israel reported. “B.D.S. is anti-Semitic, and should be treated as such,” Lord Pickles said. The boycott-Israel movement has become a contentious issue on both sides of the Atlantic. It is intended to pressure Israel into ending the occupation of the West Bank, granting equal rights to Palestinians and assuring a right of return to Israel for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. Opponents and supporters say that these measures would lead to the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state, and some consider it a thinly disguised expression of anti-Semitism. The British government issued rules to prevent local governments from boycotting Israel three years ago, but a High Court ruled them unlawful because the matter fell outside of the government’s statutory powers. After the ruling, boycott opponents called for new anti-boycott legislation. The Leicester City Council began a boycott of products from Israeli settlements in the West Bank in 2014 because it said it opposed “continuing illegal occupation” of Palestinian territory. A Jewish group asked a judge to review the boycott, calling it discriminatory, but a court dismissed the challenge last year.  Disputes over the boycott movement have driven a wedge between students on some American college campuses. President Trump, responding in part to the boycott movement, signed an executive order last week empowering the Education Department to take action against colleges that it believed were discriminating against Jewish students.  The definition of anti-Semitism used in the order includes certain criticism of Israel that could be interpreted to prohibit support for B.D.S. The United States House of Representatives adopted a resolution in July condemning B.D.S. A number of American states have also adopted legislation denying state contracts to or barring state investments in people or groups that support boycotts of Israel. In Britain, Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party has tried to capitalize on accusations that the opposition Labour Party has turned a blind eye to anti-Semitism, courting Jews angered by Labour’s stance. The accusations against Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, contributed to an enormous crumbling of public support for his parliamentary campaign. The Conservatives won a commanding majority in Parliament in the election last week. But the Conservative leadership is already facing questions about two of its newly elected lawmakers’ connections to anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. One lawmaker, Sally-Ann Hart, had previously shared a video implying that George Soros controlled the European Union, and liked a comment beneath the video using a Nazi slogan, a matter that Michael Gove, a minister in Mr. Johnson’s Conservative cabinet, said this weekend was “cause for concern.” Lee Anderson, the other lawmaker, was discovered to have been an active member of a Facebook group that circulated conspiracy theories about Mr. Soros, a Jewish billionaire philanthropist.']","The new Conservative government plans to pass a law restricting local authorities from participating in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement."
"After Volcano Blast, New Zealand Asks if Adventure Tourism Can Last",2019-12-15,By Jamie Tarabay,"['WHAKATANE, New Zealand — When Phil van Dusschoten retired as a police officer and started a diving business 24 years ago, the next chapter of his life seemed set, steering visitors through the stunning Bay of Plenty to frolic with dolphins and swim around the volcanic White Island. That life and livelihood have been on pause since an eruption last Monday fired toxic gas and molten rocks into the air and engulfed the island in ash. Eight people died on the island and another eight have since succumbed to their wounds. Two others remain missing. Now the country is wondering about the economic aftershocks.  “People come to New Zealand because they expect to be challenged like this, to see if you have the nerve to step outside your comfort zone,” Mr. van Dusschoten said. “We hope that doesn’t go away.” The tragedy has set off an intense debate among New Zealanders about tourism, including whether nature is being wrongly exploited for thrills and whether enough precautions are being taken.  Many wonder whether the disaster will ruin adventure tourism for New Zealand. The country has a famed marketing campaign, “100% Pure New Zealand,” which includes ads filled with people rappelling down cliffs, helicopter snowboarding and white-water rafting — but also has a legal system that makes it hard to sue when things go wrong. The concerns echo those in other nations where tourism can be lucrative but treacherous. Nepal considered new safety rules for Mount Everest this year after one of its deadliest climbing seasons ever, and as more visitors flock to sites like Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan, the authorities are facing more questions about the safety of so-called dark tourism. New Zealand has much at stake. Tourism is the country’s biggest export, representing nearly 6 percent of its economic output, roughly double the industry’s share of the economies of Australia and the United States.  And the business is booming. In a country where growth is hard to find, tourism revenue has soared 50 percent over the past six years, according to government figures. The industry directly or indirectly employs more than 14 percent of the work force, providing 393,279 jobs last year. The people of Whakatane, the town closest to White Island, have been processing Monday’s explosion with shock, anger and fear.  Radio stations heard from callers who recounted stories of their riskiest trips and complained that more regulation would turn New Zealand into a nanny state. Employees in outdoor equipment stores worried that with White Island temporarily off limits, tourists would stop coming. Some residents accused tour operators of putting profits before safety, suggesting that they had ignored warnings about increased seismic activity.    Whakatane has no jurisdiction over the island, which is privately owned and comes under the mandate of New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs. But their fates are inextricably intertwined. Mayor Judy Turner called the island the “anchor” of the town, saying in an interview, “It is still the backbone of our economy, and there would be an impact if it’s closed to the public.”  A sudden drop in overseas visitors is not her greatest concern. Around 80 percent of tourism to Whakatane is domestic, she said, suggesting that interest will not disappear. “It’s a place where New Zealanders come for a holiday,” she said. Along the Bay of Plenty, with the volcano visible in the far distance, sits the local marae, the communal meeting place for Whakatane’s Maori people. The Ngati Awa tribe lives here, and even with people of its own missing on the island this past week allowed foreign families with lost loved ones onto its sacred ground.  One tribal leader, Pouroto Ngaropo, said the explosion was the island’s response to being exploited for money. “I think she’s had enough of tourism,” he said of Whakaari, the Maori name for White Island. “They make millions off her a year, that’s the real issue. People have lost sight of the meaning of nature and its beauty, he said, and are focused on shallow experiences.  “If we don’t listen, and then it keeps occurring, then what?” he said. “At least I can say I gave my message, and if anyone continues on the same path and others keep dying, I’ve told you so. Not me, she did.” The tribe has placed a spiritual ban on the island and its surrounding waters, barring any fishing or maritime activity until the dead are accounted for.  White Island’s owners, three brothers who inherited the volcano after it was bought in 1936 by an Auckland stockbroker named George Raymond Buttle, issued a statement asking that the spiritual ban, or rahui, be respected. With the two people still missing, it seems likely to stay in place.  The police on Sunday confirmed the deaths of two brothers — Matthew Robert Hollander, 13, and Berend Lawrence Hollander, 16, United States citizens who lived in Australia —\xa0and of Karla Michelle Mathews, 32, of Australia, in the eruption.  They have also named as among the dead four Australians —\xa0Krystal Eve Browitt, 21, Zoe Ella Hosking, 15, and Gavin Brian Dallow, 53, and Anthony James Landford, 51 — and a New Zealander, Tipene Maangi, 24. Maintaining a moratorium on tourism on White Island for any stretch of time could prove difficult. It has been featured for years along with other destinations in the country’s adventure tourism marketing. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who faces elections next year, has been vague about whether that approach to tourism needs to change and whether the volcano should be off limits. “We hear, and we absolutely agree, that there are questions that have been asked and must be answered,” she said on Friday. She also noted that White Island was a “volcano that’s been visited for the better part of 30 years” without serious misfortune. New Zealand’s legal system encourages a culture of risk-taking, experts say. It has a “no fault” framework that bars personal injury lawsuits in favor of a government compensation process for accidents, largely protecting businesses from the threat of large payouts.  “We have no court cases now for negligence or injury from motor vehicles, aircraft crashes, hot coffee, slipping over,” said Tim Mackenzie, a health and safety lawyer in Christchurch. People can sue for damages, he said, “but it is a very high test, rarely if ever met.” In Whakatane, many argue that a dash of danger is what people want. Even as boat rides, helicopter jaunts and other outdoor activities were suspended, Mr. van Dusschoten said he and other tour operators had fielded calls all week from people around the world who still wanted to visit. One woman, he said, conveyed that she had visited volcanoes in Hawaii and wanted to get close to White Island “to feel the fury.”  Mr. van Dusschoten insisted, as did many other New Zealanders, that what happened on Monday was unpredictable, the first natural catastrophe of its magnitude in decades of adventure tourism. The last time anyone died on White Island was in 1914 when part of a crater wall collapsed, killing 10 miners. Danger is part and parcel of New Zealand’s attraction, he said. “We do white-water rafting — there are places here you can go off a waterfall. Thousands of people do it, and you might have a drowning or two,” he said. “People walk on a glacier that could collapse at any time.”  Mr. van Dusschoten added, “It’s all risky stuff, but honestly, that’s what a lot of tourists demand these days, especially the young ones.”  Damien Cave contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia, and Sasha Borissenko from Auckland, New Zealand.  ']",The eruption on White Island has set off an intense debate on exploiting nature for thrills. 
E.U. Lawmakers Condemn Subsidy Corruption but Disagree on What to Do,2019-12-17,By Matt Apuzzo,"['BRUSSELS — European Union lawmakers on Tuesday strongly criticized corruption and self-dealing in the bloc’s $65-billion-a-year farm subsidy program but were sharply divided over how or whether to reform a system that has become a third rail of European politics. At a time of festering anti-European sentiment, the debate over one of the world’s largest subsidy programs highlighted a fissure that cuts far deeper than a simple dispute over farm policy. It raised the question of how to combat political corruption without infringing on the independence of the bloc’s 28 nations — and further emboldening its far-right populist critics. Tuesday’s debate happened during a European Parliament budget oversight hearing, which was prompted, in part, by a New York Times investigation into the farm subsidy program, known as the Common Agricultural Policy or C.A.P.  In November, the Times revealed how subsidies help underwrite oligarchs, enrich politicians and encourage land-grabbing and Mafia-style tactics.  “The recent New York Times report on the abuse of C.A.P. subsidies is damning and undermines trust in government,” said Mick Wallace, a European lawmaker from Ireland. The Times tracked state land sales and subsidies that benefited friends and family members of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, while also identifying at least $79 million in government subsidies paid to companies owned by the Andrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic.  “It quite ironic to see populists such as Andrej Babis and Viktor Orban making such hue and cry about how European Union money is spent, while the same two people use E.U. money to enrich their friends,” said Lara Wolters, a lawmaker from the Netherlands and member of the budget oversight committee. In the hearing, Ms. Wolters argued that Parliament should reconsider the core premise of the subsidy program — that farmers are paid based on how much land they control. Such a change would curb the ability of national leaders to use farmland as political chits. And it could reduce the incentives for large, politically powerful companies to acquire more land. But it would also amount to a seismic overhaul of a fund regarded as sacrosanct by many national politicians and many farmers.  European lawmakers are now debating the renewal of the bloc’s next seven-year farm bill. National leaders want more discretion on how to spend the money, and farmers want fewer administrative requirements. In Brussels, there is little appetite for a major reform that would impose greater oversight on governments — even those that have manipulated or abused the system.  So the latest proposal, which will be debated in the coming months, gives national leaders like Mr. Babis and Mr. Orban even greater power to set farm policy and oversee spending, despite allegations of corruption. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, and several lawmakers objected Tuesday.  “We can’t even adequately police corruption,” said Sheila Ritchie of Scotland. “What on Earth makes us think self-policing compliance is going to work?” Johannes Hahn, the European budget administrator, defended the bloc’s approach to corruption and abuse, noting that European auditors have investigated and audited Mr. Babis.  “We have reacted very quickly,” he said.  But the Babis investigations also reveal how accountability is still limited. Years ago, European investigators recommended that Mr. Babis be charged with fraud, but they lack jurisdiction or authority to bring charges. The case has languished in the Czech Republic. And the audit is expected to drag on for many months, during which time Mr. Babis can still vote on the European budget. The European Union is not a government but an economic and political bloc. While it has a system of shared laws, the union is built on the concept of national sovereignty.  Those tensions bubbled over on Tuesday, as some lawmakers strongly rejected suggestions that cracking down on corruption required the European Union to take on new oversight. “Some colleagues want the E.U. to have even greater responsibilities and to supervise member states even more,” Tomislav Sokol, a Croatian lawmaker, said during the hearing, held in Strasbourg, France. “But member states should look after their own interests. Solutions should not be imposed by the European Union.” The clearest divisions, though, were between lawmakers calling for a significant overhaul of the subsidy program and those who argued for keeping it intact. “The story here isn’t actually about a few bad apples robbing funds,” said Clare Daly, an Irish lawmaker. “The problem is actually the system itself.” Such sentiments elicited a rebuke from Clara Aguilera of Spain, who is also a member of the agricultural committee.  “There are people who are trying to make these problems into a general condemnation of the C.A.P.,” she said. “I refuse to join in this blanket condemnation.”']",A Times investigation showed how oligarchs and political patrons make millions in farm subsidies. But the program is all but sacrosanct.
"From Canada’s Legal High, a Business Letdown",2019-12-15,By Ian Austen,"['SMITHS FALLS, Ontario — When Canada became the first major industrialized nation to legalize recreational marijuana, visions of billions of dollars in profits inspired growers, retailers and investors, sending the stock market soaring in a so-called green rush. A year later, the euphoria has vanished.  “No one wants to invest in it now,” said John-Kurt Pliniussen, a professor of marketing at the Smith School of Business at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.  That is because those who have invested have generally lost money. During the first year after legalization, the value of shares in Canada’s six largest marijuana companies tumbled by an average of 56 percent, according to stock price data.  The marijuana companies say a turnaround is only a matter of time, hoping a big step along the way materialized on Dec. 16, when marijuana-laced drinks and foods arrived in the legal market. But the problems that plagued the first year remain. One is that the provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec, whose residents account for about two-thirds of Canada’s population, have opened or licensed legal pot shops at a glacial pace — despite a clear demand. Potential customers are still underserved with just 24 legal marijuana shops for Ontario’s 17.5 million residents. So many are still buying on the black market.  And freed from taxation, the black market is generally cheaper across the country. Another problem, many in the industry say, is that the elaborate regulatory structure for legal cannabis has been an impediment to sales. Canada’s regulations were designed only to decriminalize marijuana use, not necessarily encourage it. The result is a system that mimics the country’s approach to tobacco, and largely blocks marketing and advertising. “This last year has been very painful,” said Eric Kirzner, a professor emeritus of finance at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, who compared the fate of marijuana stocks to earlier technology share crashes. “Marijuana is hardly the technology industry, but to me the stories are similar in the sense that we had all kinds of hype.” Mr. Pliniussen doesn’t see the opening of the market to edibles as a turning point. “I expect this to be just like slow ripples on a pond as opposed to a tsunami of excitement,” he said. “What we have now is what we’re going to have — this is it.” Despite the crushing business disappointments, there has been a bright spot: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s experiment in legalizing cannabis has not turned Canada into a stoner nation, as was widely feared.  Marijuana-impaired motorists are not menacing the nation’s highways, and workers are not getting high on the job. There has not even been much change in marijuana use, except for a small rise among people over 65, according to Statistics Canada, the government census agency.  “It kind of fell flat,” said Professor Michael Amlung, a professor of psychiatry at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario who studies marijuana use. “The overwhelmingly expected response has not happened.” For the companies, the economic growing pains have been tough. Take Canopy Growth, the biggest Canadian grower. Canopy’s business has its headquarters in Smiths Falls, Ontario, once the home of Hershey Canada. A sprawling complex of marijuana growing and processing rooms replaced the assembly lines that once spat out thousands of chocolate bars and peanut butter cups each day.  These days, construction is booming at the plant, with new additions being built on either side of the former chocolate factory. Inside, along with the marijuana growing and processing rooms, chocolate making is back if on a vastly smaller scale and a new added ingredient. Across the street, technicians are doing the final tweaks to equipment inside a brand-new, 150,000 square foot bottling and canning plant that will soon make marijuana-infused drinks. But during the first six months of its current fiscal year, Canopy lost 1.6 billion Canadian dollars. Bruce Linton, the company’s founder, former chairman and chief executive who was once the industry’s de facto spokesman, was fired earlier this year.  Among its problems, Canopy struggled with converting greenhouses in British Columbia and Quebec that once grew vegetables into ones producing something to smoke. It built costly systems in Smiths Falls to turn lower quality plants into oil, only to find that Canadians overwhelming prefer to smoke the plants’ dried flower buds. And costs spiraled upward as it rushed to meet the new market’s demands.  Constellation Brands, the American company that is Canopy’s largest shareholder and also the owner of Corona beer and Robert Mondavi wine, has cut off further investment. It will install one of its executives in Mr. Linton’s former place next month.  Canopy’s shares, which hit 70 Canadian dollars during the lead up to legalization are now down by about 66 percent. Rade Kovacevic. Canopy’s president, is still optimistic.  “It’s been a very exciting ride,” said Mr. Kovacevic, despite the “short-term pain points.”  He added that the “more exciting part” will come as edibles and other products become more widely available. “We’re not a company that’s in this for the next three quarters, we’re a company that’s in this for next three decades,” said Mr. Kovacevic, who started in the industry as a lobbyist for medical marijuana dispensaries.  Variations of the Canopy scenario have played out at most of its major competitors. Some have suffered worse problems.  For example, the growing license of CannTrust Holdings was suspended after Health Canada, the federal regulator, learned that the company used a false wall to hide an illicit cultivation area from inspectors.  The company’s chief executive, a former banker, was fired, and the company is now under police investigation. Its stock is in danger of being removed from the TSX exchange in Toronto. A major problem for growers generally is that it’s still not easy for many Canadians to legally buy marijuana, particularly in Ontario.  Not long before legalization, a Conservative government took power in the province and swiftly canceled a plan by the Liberal government it replaced to sell through government-owned stores. But Professor Amlung said research showed that Canadians overwhelmingly preferred buying marijuana in stores. “Online they can’t actually see the product,” he said. “They can’t smell the product, a lot of those things that are part of purchasing cannabis.”  On Thursday, Ontario announced that it was lifting its limits on store licenses and will issue about 20 licenses monthly, starting in March 2020. But, for now, the lack of stores in Ontario, as well as in Quebec, help keep the black market afloat.  Surveys by Statistics Canada have found that only 28 percent of cannabis buyers meet all of their marijuana needs through legal sources. There is no legal marijuana shop in Smiths Falls; Canopy was not allowed to replace Hershey’s factory outlet with one of its own. But nearby in Ottawa, population 1 million, Mimi Lam, a former investment banker, owns one of three legal shops in the national capital. Strict marketing restrictions mean that passers-by can’t see into her store, Superette. But once customers pass through an I.D. check to prove that they are at least 19, they enter a shop that’s a pastiche of a 1950s diner — if one where marijuana buds sit in displays that would otherwise hold doughnuts and muffins. One recent evening, most shoppers leaving Ms. Lam’s shop, which is on the busy shopping street of an upper middle class neighborhood, declined to talk about their purchases.  One of the few people who would talk did so on the condition that she be identified only by her given name, Shauna. A university student, she said she feared using her full name might harm her employment prospects after graduation. She said there was still stigma attached to using marijuana, adding that she used it to focus while studying. She said she switched to Superette from the illegal market over concerns about the safety of street drugs. Unlike many people in Canada’s marijuana trade, Ms. Lam is making money although not as much as she had hoped. She said that for the industry to really succeed, the government needed to loosen regulations.  “This is a real opportunity for players in this country to really shine and show the rest of the world what we can do and push the boundaries of cannabis integration in society,” she said.  ']","Investors poured money into Canada’s marijuana market, but one year after legalization, the euphoria has evaporated. "
Pope Francis Abolishes Secrecy Policy in Sexual Abuse Cases,2019-12-17,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The Vatican on Tuesday said it would abolish the high level of secrecy it has applied to sexual-abuse accusations against clerics, ending a policy that critics said had often shielded priests from criminal punishment by the secular authorities. Removing that cloak of confidentiality, the Roman Catholic Church is changing its stance to make it acceptable — but not required — to turn information about abuse claims over to the police, prosecutors and judges. In recent years, church officials in the United States and some other countries have shared with civil authorities information about some sexual abuse allegations. But that cooperation, in theory, defied a decree adopted in 2001 that made the information a “pontifical secret” — the church’s most classified knowledge. Victims and their advocates said the restrictions hampered civil authorities and helped conceal crimes, and they greeted Francis’ new instructions as a step forward. “Things are decidedly changing,” said Francesco Zanardi, an Italian survivor of clerical abuse and the president of Rete l’Abuso, an Italian anti-abuse group. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a group that tracks abuse in the church, said the pope had taken “an overdue and desperately needed step.” “For decades, pontifical secrecy has been an obstruction to civil justice, spurring bishops worldwide to thwart prosecutions of abusive priests,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said in a statement. She called changing the policy “a first step toward decreasing the anti-victim bias of canon law.” On Tuesday, the pope also made the canon law against child pornography more stringent, a change that victims’ groups had pushed for. Previously, possession or dissemination of pornographic images of children under 14 was considered a “most grave crime.” That category that will now apply to images of children under 18. The secrecy change is the latest step in the church’s attempts to tackle the sexual abuse crisis that has dogged it for decades. Growing global pressure for greater accountability forced the issue to the front of Pope Francis’ agenda. In response to the demands for change, Francis convened a summit meeting of church leaders in February to address the crisis. It ended with a call “for an all-out battle against the abuse of minors” and insistence that the church needed to protect children “from ravenous wolves.” Weeks after that meeting, the pope issued a new canon law, requiring for the first time that church officials report abuse charges to Vatican prosecutors. Francis then issued a rule requiring that all church officials report to their superiors either abuse allegations or attempts to cover them up. The rule announced on Tuesday was also a product of the February meeting, the Vatican said. “This is a sign of openness, transparency and the willingness to collaborate with the civil authorities,” Andrea Tornielli, the editorial director of the Vatican’s communications office, wrote in a commentary. Under the new norms, “any reporting, testimony and documents” related to sexual abuse “can now be handed over when requested to lawful authorities in their respective countries,” Mr. Tornielli wrote. The Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Vatican’s child protection commission, said, “This is pretty much revolutionary.”  Ms. Barrett Doyle was less confident. “The impact of this change will be determined by how broadly it is applied,” she said. It was not clear, for example, whether the new policy would be applied retroactively, she said. Ms. Barrett Doyle and other victim advocates, while praising the change, said it did not address many of the other issues they have raised, like the fact that the church has not adopted a policy of defrocking any priest who has abused a child. “It’s a little-known, appalling fact that under universal church law, guilty priests still are allowed to remain in ministry,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said. The Vatican had previously argued that the imposition of pontifical secrecy was necessary to protect both victim and accused. Church officials also said they could not insist that abuse allegations be reported to the civil authorities because in many parts of the world, that would put priests’ lives in danger. But critics said the rules deterred victims from coming forward and helped cover up sexual abuse. Father Zollner said that confidentiality was never supposed to be a “hiding place for the church, but unfortunately it was used” that way “many times.” The new guidelines, which go into effect on Jan. 1, specify that “confidentiality shall not prevent the fulfillment of the obligations laid down in all places by civil laws, including any reporting obligations, and the execution of enforceable requests of civil judicial authorities.” Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, the Vatican’s chief sex crime investigator, called Francis’ decree an “epochal decision that removes obstacles and impediments.” The changes do not affect the secrecy of confession. The instructions also made clear that even if documents and testimony produced in canonical trials are shared with civil law enforcement officials or other interested parties, they may not be made public. “The right of the victims and the witnesses to confidentiality must always be protected,” Mr. Tornielli wrote. “Now, however, the documentation must be placed at the disposal of the civil authority for the purpose of investigating cases for which canonical proceedings have already begun.” On Tuesday, the pope accepted the resignation of Archbishop Luigi Ventura, the Vatican ambassador to France, who has been under investigation in France for sexual assault. In July, the Vatican revoked his diplomatic immunity.']",Church officials can now share information with secular law enforcement authorities. Critics said the confidentiality rule led to the concealment of abuse.
Violence in Northern Ireland Rising Amid Political Paralysis,2019-12-16,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['DERRY, Northern Ireland — On a cold, rainy night last January, a group of masked men abducted a 15-year-old boy from his home in Creggan, Northern Ireland, threw him into the back of a van and took him to a dark alleyway. There, they pinned him against a shuttered storefront and shot him in the legs until he collapsed. The men were linked to one of the region’s main militant groups, the New Irish Republican Army. “They beat me up, I couldn’t breathe and then bang, bang, bang, bang. Everything went blurry and I fell to the ground,” the teenager, now 16, recalled, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety. “Two of the bullets hit me directly in the shins and two more pierced my thighs. The blood was just pouring out everywhere,” he said, rolling up his tracksuit to reveal the bullet wounds, which have left two crevasses under his kneecaps. Violence in Northern Ireland has fallen sharply since the 1998 Good Friday agreement formally ended a bloody 30-year guerrilla war between mostly Catholic republicans, seeking unification with the Republic of Ireland, and predominantly Protestant loyalists and unionists, who favor remaining in the United Kingdom.  But now, paramilitary groups that have been lingering for decades are beginning to reorganize, driven by economic stagnation, political paralysis and the potential impact of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan, which was given a final stamp of approval in last week’s general election after the Conservative Party won a commanding majority in the British Parliament. Since January, republican militias have targeted the police with bombs and mortars, killed a journalist and carried out dozens of “punishment style” attacks on ordinary people in an attempt to take over the policing of deprived Catholic neighborhoods like Creggan.  Violence by Protestant loyalist groups has dropped since the Ulster Volunteer Paramilitary group went on a six-week killing rampage in 2005. But they, too, administer punishment beatings in their neighborhoods.  And Mr. Johnson’s Brexit plan was a wake-up call for them, as it would keep Northern Ireland in a customs union with the Republic of Ireland. That would effectively cut off Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom — a mortal threat to unionists dedicated to preventing unification with the south.  By raising the prospect either of a physical border between the north and the south, which alarms the republicans, or a figurative one in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the loyalists and unionists, Brexit is fueling unrest in both camps. “Brexit has put the border in Ireland back into the mainstream in a way in which it hasn’t been since 1998, and ‘dissidents’ are seeking to capitalize on the associated instability and momentum gathering around questions about the border,” said Marisa McGlinchey, an assistant professor of political science at Coventry University in England. While the new generation of paramilitaries operate in smaller and less sophisticated groups than the militias that fought during the conflict, a spate of attacks this year by republican dissidents with links to the New I.R.A. have stoked fears that they will reignite sectarian tensions.  In the past year, the number of paramilitary-style attacks and deaths linked to paramilitary groups increased, according to a report published this month by the Independent Reporting Commission, a group that monitors paramilitary activity. The report found that three people had been killed and 81 injured in attacks linked to paramilitary groups in the 12 months ending in September, compared with one death and 75 injuries in the previous period. “The real issue about the dangers for peace in Northern Ireland is not that Brexit itself could be the direct cause of a renewal of violence, but rather that it has the potential to add fuel to the fire of continued paramilitarism,” the report concluded. The power vacuum created by the collapse of the region’s governing assembly in 2017 has provided paramilitary groups an opening in poorer areas, where people feel abandoned by politicians amid growing unemployment, rising crime rates, and a housing and health care crisis. House raids and “stop and search” routines by the police have also stoked anger among republican youths. In working-class Catholic neighborhoods like Creggan, republican paramilitaries have taken advantage of the community’s deep mistrust toward the predominantly Protestant Police Service of Northern Ireland to impose their own version of justice. The teenager who was shot by republican paramilitaries was being punished for stealing a phone and laptop from a store. When local residents found him on the night of the attack, lying in a pool of blood, they called a local community worker to take him to the hospital. No one informed the police, including the boy’s mother, who said the paramilitaries would have killed her if she did. “My mam has no choice,” the teenager said matter-of-factly. “I was let off lightly. If they had found drugs on me, they would have probably blasted my brains out.” While most of the community condemns paramilitary violence, many believe that the dissidents are more effective at addressing crime than are the police, whom they perceive to be working on behalf of the British state — and therefore against them.  “When some young person is shot today or tonight or whatever, first thing people would say is, ‘That’s awful,’ like that shouldn’t have happened here,” said John Donnelly, who mediates between the paramilitaries and their targets. “But then the second thing they will say is, ‘He didn’t get it for nothing.’ So, there’s a kind of acceptance.” In recent months, the New I.R.A. has stepped up attacks against the police in Creggan in a bid to stay relevant and attract young people. “It’s an opportunity for them to recruit,” said Michael Doherty, a local mediator in Derry, a former republican stronghold, “because what they’re saying is politics isn’t working in Northern Ireland, the peace deal isn’t working and it’s not going to work, Britain is still here and we need to use force to get them out.”  Republican paramilitary groups are also preparing for a situation in which they might have to respond to potential violence caused by loyalist protests against the new Brexit arrangement and its border in the Irish Sea. The proposed sea border is likely to be located in Britain, but analysts warn that the lack of a physical border target could lead to paramilitary sects attacking one another or members of the public. “Obviously if you don’t have a good target for violence in Northern Ireland, you’ll just go and find a bad one,” said Newton Emerson, a political commentator in Northern Ireland. “That would be the worry that they’ll just start attacking random people or blocking roads.” In a recent television interview, a masked spokesman for the New I.R.A. said that any British installations or infrastructure on the border or elsewhere would be a legitimate target for attack.  “The I.R.A. is an army, and as an army we are committed to armed struggle for political and social change in Ireland,” he said. At the same time, the political wing of the New I.R.A., known as Saoradh, has stepped up its recruitment efforts by providing welfare assistance, food and shelter to those in need. “They are getting stronger because of political paralysis and because of Brexit,” said Ricky O’Rawe, a former I.R.A. member who now helps victims of paramilitary violence. “They are trying to assert themselves, and even though they are not very organized now they do have the potential to put together a concentrated campaign, and that could get dangerous.” A 43-year-old dissident republican in Creggan with links to the New I.R.A. said he had resisted violence in recent years because he believed that the United Kingdom would fall apart naturally after Brexit, forcing unification with the Republic of Ireland. “I had some hope for a while, but the peace arrangement is void, it’s one-sided and Brexit is giving the British state more control,” he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid being investigated by the police. “We have no choice now but to take matters into our own hands.”']","Paramilitary attacks are increasing again, fueled by economic stagnation, a leadership vacuum and the impact of a looming Brexit.

Welcome to Parliament. Now Sit Down and Shut Up.,2019-12-16,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — There was no hiding the excitement on Monday as new members of Britain’s Parliament descended on the Palace of Westminster for day one of their new lives, most propelled there by the landslide victory of Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party. “Still hasn’t sunk in,” wrote Jonathan Gullis, the new Conservative lawmaker for Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke on Twitter. “So humbled to have been elected.” Next stop for the novice Conservative lawmakers was a welcome meeting on Monday night with Mr. Johnson who was expected to flatter them but also instruct them to repay the public’s trust in what he calls the “people’s government.” The advice from veterans was curt: enjoy the euphoria of the moment, because it won’t last. The House of Commons has stood at the center of Britain’s political crisis during the last two years, as the government struggled to get its Brexit plan through Parliament while lacking a majority. Every vote counted and every lawmaker mattered. But with Mr. Johnson’s big new majority things have fundamentally changed. The days when the niche Parliament TV channel could draw more than a million viewers to the drama of knife-edge Brexit votes are over. New lawmakers are likely to find themselves either part of an impotent opposition or lobby fodder for a government with so many bodies that individuals simply don’t matter. “Winning a seat for the first time is one of the great moments in life, for most people it is the end of a long cherished ambition,” said Tim Yeo, a former Conservative lawmaker who arrived in Parliament in 1983, after Margaret Thatcher won an equally huge victory. But, if you are part of a very large new intake, what awaits you is a “rude shock,” he said. “You arrive at Westminster and you are the new boy or girl at what turns out to be a rather bigger school than you thought,” he said. “You suddenly realize that you are a person of the utmost insignificance.” Undoubtedly, the infusion of new blood will change the complexion and feel of Parliament. Dehenna Davison, the new Conservative lawmaker for Bishop Auckland, for example, worked in restaurants, a betting shop and a casino and lost a job in retail when her employer went out of business.  Significantly, the Conservative Party’s lawmakers now include many, like Ms. Davison, from the north and middle of the country, the so called “red wall” of former Labour Party seats, that fell to the Tories. Together, their presence could shift the geographical balance of the party’s political focus from the south and from the rural districts — the so-called “shires.” The problem is that, individually, they will count for very little. With a large majority behind him, Mr. Johnson can get through more or less any legislation that he wants just as Mrs. Thatcher could in the 1980s, and Tony Blair could after 1997 for Labour. That does not sideline Parliament completely but it does change the role of lawmaker to people who essentially scrutinize legislation and try to influence government policy by getting their voices heard, often behind the scenes. Select committees, which take evidence and compile reports on policy areas, can be very influential. “It is extremely unlikely that the government will lose votes in the Commons now,” wrote Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, a research organization, in a blog. “But members of Parliament can still pressure the government in multiple, different ways: statements in the chamber, departmental questions, urgent questions and emergency debates, Prime Minister’s Questions, and select committee hearings, backbench and opposition-led debates.” she wrote. Parliament might, occasionally, be able to embarrass Mr. Johnson but not to thwart him. For Conservative lawmakers, there will be little point being troublesome or independent, because that would wreck any chances of promotion. Rebelling against Mr. Johnson would consign them to outer darkness by their party whips, and they would lose any vote anyway.  For opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat lawmakers there is a long fight ahead to revive their parties’ fortunes ahead of the next general election. Power for them is years away, at a minimum.  And the new lawmakers from the pro-independence Scottish National Party arrive with the intention of putting themselves out of a job by helping Scotland to separate from the United Kingdom. Mr. Yeo predicted that new Conservative lawmakers would find themselves battling for attention against some very ambitious colleagues eager to get onto the first rung of the promotion ladder. He remembered going from local prominence in the area where he was elected to virtual anonymity in Parliament. “When you come to Westminster you are in the jungle again,” he recalled, “and few people are more carnivorous than new members of Parliament.”']","New lawmakers may have realized a lifetime ambition. But with a huge Conservative majority, individual members will have little influence. "
"In Era of Hardening Identities, Trump Order on Jews Kindles Questions Old and New",2019-12-15,By Max Fisher,"['President Trump’s executive order targeting anti-Semitic and anti-Israel speech on campuses might be framed as a narrow legal matter, but it has touched on a defining issue of our time: Who belongs, and who decides? The order is ambiguous as to whether it sees Jews as a distinct nationality or a minority race, but either interpretation aligns with Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with defining, and policing, the boundaries of identity.  And the order’s creation of special status for Jews, but not other religious minorities, follows Mr. Trump’s habit of welcoming some demographic groups into the rights and protections of American identity and excluding others. Tellingly, the singling out of Jews for special protection in the order left some feeling still more exposed. Such preoccupations with identity have animated not just the Trump administration but much of the global populist backlash. Leaders and movements across the democratic world are increasingly focused on enforcing narrow national identities of the sort that defined the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The era of hardening national identities includes the rise of far-right parties in Europe, white nationalism in the United States and a campaign for Hindu dominance in India.  Mr. Trump’s order, however narrow its intentions, underscores the degree to which the problems and contradictions of national identity — a distinctly modern invention that remade the world before almost destroying it — remain unresolved. The dilemmas of the new nationalist era are especially surfaced by the order’s focus on Jews, whose relationship to conceptions of race and nationality has always been fraught. It touches on some of the most sensitive questions of Jewish identity — questions that are extensions of ways that national identity both made the modern world and never quite put it back together. The concept, scarcely 200 years old, holds that humanity is divided among fixed communities, each defined by a common language, ethnicity and homeland. Those communities are nations; membership is one’s national identity. The core tenet of nationalism so pervades today’s world that it feels almost self-evident: Any nation of people should have a country, and any country should consist of a nation. The concept of an overarching identity tied to one’s country was invented not by ancient poets or warriors but by 19th-century European governments. As monarchies teetered and the church declined, governments saw engineering common languages and ethnic heritages as a way to justify their rule over polyglot empires, as well as an opportunity to marshal their populations for collective pursuits like industry or war. “Nations as a natural, God-given way of classifying men, as an inherent though long-delayed political destiny, are a myth,” the British-Czech political theorist Ernest Gellner wrote. But this way of thinking reshaped 19th-century Europe, leading to the creation of modern Italy and Germany. It later spread to the rest of the world, inspiring independence and liberation movements on the basis that all people belong to national groups awaiting their nation. National identity’s rise, however, also turned minorities and migrants into second-class citizens — or even into perceived threats within. It turned racial purity into a matter of ethnic, and therefore national, survival. It defined nations as irrevocably divided from one another by race and heritage.  The world, unable to unwind a global order built on national identity, sought to manage its worst tendencies by promoting cultural pluralism, international integration and protections for minorities and migrants.  These values did not so much replace national identity as sit uneasily alongside it,  eventually leading to a backlash.  Leaders like Viktor Orban of Hungary combine the old appeals to blood and soil with something new: promises to smash the systems of multiculturalism and integration seen as posing just as grave a threat to national identity as any minority or migrant. Mr. Trump rose on a similar message, saying about immigration and border restrictions he considered dangerously weak, “You either have a country or you don’t.” Mr. Trump’s order, for purposes of monitoring educational institutions’ handling of discrimination, places Jews under Civil Rights Act protections based on race, color or national origin. The order also draws on a 2005 definition of anti-Semitism, one of whose authors has since said is overly broad, conflating hatred of Jews with criticism of Israel.  Mr. Trump has at times conflated American Jews with Israelis. Speaking to an American Jewish group, he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, as “your prime minister.” He has also described Jewish Democrats who criticized Israeli policies as “disloyal to Israel.” Jewish groups are sensitive to implications that their religion carries a distinct nationality. Centuries of European anti-Semitism were built on the belief that Jews were foreigners within. As late as the 1980s, Soviet passports designated “Jewish” as a nationality akin to Russian or Ukrainian. In the late 19th century, as modern national identity took hold, some Jewish leaders arrived at a position that hinted at the contradictions of the era. They embraced the notion that European Jews really were ethnically distinct from their non-Jewish neighbors — and that all Jews belonged to a unified people. In what was then an era of national self-determination, this also made Jews a nationality that, like many liberation movements of the time, sought a nation of their own. Serbian or Armenian nationalists placed their nations where ethnic Serbs and Armenians lived. But, with Jews dispersed across a half-dozen empires, Zionism’s leaders settled on the ancient biblical land of Judea.  Mr. Trump’s order, by treating anti-Israel protests as a form of anti-Semitism, hits on long-running Jewish debates over whether or not Israel is an extension of a shared identity. The Israeli national narrative, of a long-forgotten homeland waiting to be rediscovered by a citizenry scattered by history, implies a Jewish identity that is innately ethnic and national. Still, American Jewish attitudes toward Israel are cooling; national fealty, for many, is a stretch. The executive order also suggests that the government may see Jews as a distinct race.      Since World War II, American Jews have been on a generational drift from Jewishness as a national identity, which no longer felt as necessary. But a series of political and cultural changes have called that postwar identity into question.  Rising white nationalism increasingly targets Jews as unwelcome outsiders. Conspiracy theories, some entering the mainstream, portray them as nationless cosmopolitans bent on undermining Western countries’ racial purity.    Mr. Trump’s order raises anew a question that has faced Jews throughout the 200-year era of national identity: whether such identities offer them security or only peril. It is an echo of late 19th-century debates, when some urged embracing national identity and forming a state, while others argued for casting it off and integrating into multicultural democracies instead.  The wider democratic world asked itself this same question in the wake of World War II. It declared old-style national identity a curse and pluralistic democracy the only path to peace, but the argument has raged off and on ever since —\xa0as it has, in parallel, for Jews. In a twist of history, the creation of Israel put Jews on the opposite side of the  question: Now they had to decide whether a Jewish national identity had room for minorities. Early Zionist leaders insisted that it did. But more recent Israeli leaders have promoted Israeli identity as exclusively Jewish and have imposed severe restrictions on Palestinians.  Mr. Trump’s order sharpens this matter as well, offering Jews greater protections by curbing anti-Israel activism that is sometimes animated by Palestinian demands for national self-determination. In a sign of how much the world has changed, the new nationalists, from Mr. Orban to Narendra Modi of India, have rallied around Mr. Netanyahu as an ally and model. In a sign of how much it has not changed, all three have invoked ancient ethnic heritage in deploying distinctly modern controls on their country’s religious minorities. Mr. Netanyahu, like Mr. Trump, has emphasized hard-line policies as necessary to preserve Jewish identity.

Beijing Backs Hong Kong Leader Despite Election Setback,2019-12-16,By Keith Bradsher and Austin Ramzy,"['BEIJING — China’s top leader backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam of Hong Kong on Monday despite the monthslong protests that have rocked the city and the recent landslide defeat in local elections of political parties aligned with her.  Xi Jinping, China’s president, praised Mrs. Lam for her “courage and responsibility” during what he called the “gravest and most complicated year” in Hong Kong since it returned to China from Britain in 1997.  In an implicit warning to the protesters who seek greater autonomy for the region, Mr. Xi also stressed that Beijing had an “unwavering determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests.”  Mrs. Lam’s visit to Beijing over the weekend and on Monday was an annual year-end event for Hong Kong’s leaders, at which their performance is assessed by China’s leaders. But her visit is being closely watched for signs of her fate as Hong Kong’s leader after six months of protests punctuated by frequent street violence.  The protests began in June over an unpopular extradition bill Mrs. Lam pushed to pass that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China to face trial in a Communist Party-controlled judicial system. Mrs. Lam has quickly become a personal target for the city’s protesters, who see her as a symbol of a leadership that is overly beholden to its patrons in Beijing and not accountable to the city’s seven million people.  Earlier Monday, Mrs. Lam also met with China’s No. 2 official, Premier Li Keqiang, who praised her for rolling out a series of measures to help businesses and stabilize employment. “You have been leading the government in safeguarding social stability with the utmost effort,” Mr. Li said to Mrs. Lam in a televised excerpt released by the Hong Kong government.  “It can be said that you rose to the challenges,” he said. “The central government fully affirms the efforts that you and the government have made.” Mr. Li added that Hong Kong had not escaped its predicament. He called on Mrs. Lam’s government to continue working to “stop the violence and curb disorder.”  He said officials should work quickly to find solutions to “deep-rooted contradictions and problems” in Hong Kong’s society and economy. The Chinese government has previously urged Hong Kong’s leaders to address high housing prices, a yawning wealth gap and other economic issues. Mrs. Lam herself has said that she is willing to do whatever is necessary to bring peace to the city although she has denied rumors that she actually submitted her resignation over the summer. Senior Hong Kong officials and Beijing’s advisers have said that even if she wanted to resign, China’s leaders would not allow her to do so, because that might be seen as a sign of weakness on their part. Mr. Xi previously praised Mrs. Lam’s leadership of Hong Kong when she visited Shanghai in early November. But that visit was immediately followed by a two-week violent showdown between police and activists at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and then the almost complete collapse of pro-Beijing parties in local elections. Democracy advocates swept 87 percent of the seats on neighborhood councils in those elections and took control of 17 of the territory’s 18 councils. They previously had about a quarter of the seats and controlled none of the councils. The vote was hailed as a sign of enduring support for the protest movement despite increasingly violent clashes with the police. The contentious bill was formally withdrawn in September, but protesters say they will not stop until their other demands are met, including free and open elections of the territory’s leadership and legislature and an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality during the unrest.  The election results appeared to come as a surprise to Beijing, which, together with its allies in the city, had portrayed the vote as a way for a silent majority in Hong Kong to “end social chaos and violence” by signaling their unhappiness with the protest movement. State media in Beijing ultimately blamed the outcome of the vote on interference from hostile Western forces bent on stirring up unrest in the city.

"A Rare Russian Tech Triumph, a Police Raid and a Backlash",2019-12-17,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — The deal, worth $670 million, was a triumph for Russia’s tech sector, which is rich in talent but often impoverished by the country’s stumbling efforts to market its world-class skills. The sale to an American company this year of Nginx, a Russian company that developed web server software now used by more than a third of the world’s websites, sent a clear message that Russian programmers can create valuable products for the global market. But that was before Russia’s notoriously capricious and aggressive law-enforcement system got involved. In a series of raids late last week, police officers armed with automatic weapons searched the homes of the company’s Russian founders, Igor Sysoyev and Maxim Konovalov, who were taken in for questioning, and also their company’s Moscow office. Both men now work for F5 Networks, a Seattle-based tech company that purchased Nginx — pronounced “engine-x” — in May. Amid widespread dismay and anger over the raids, a criminal case initiated by the authorities against Nginx has turned one of Russia’s biggest IT success stories into a case study of why the country has so much trouble developing its economy beyond just pulling oil, gas and other natural resources out of the ground. Aleksandr Belov, the head of an internet start-up incubator at the Moscow Physics and Technology Institute, warned that the case “kills technological progress, kills entrepreneurship, kills the already dead venture market and closes the windows to capital for Russian start-ups.” The police action against Nginx came just weeks after armed security officials raided a prestigious Moscow physics institute as part of a criminal case against a private, high-end optics company that, from rented office space at the Lebedev Physics Institute, had developed a small business processing raw glass imported from China and exporting the finished products abroad. Aleksandr Gorbunov, an acerbic and hugely popular social media critic of Russia’s often lawless law-enforcement agencies, condemned the latest raids as another sign of how Russia is governed by “the law of the jungle, where the only way to survive is to constantly demonstrate your strength over the weak in the hope that stronger animals will leave you alone.” The early morning raids on Mr. Sysoyev and Mr. Konovalov were triggered by a criminal case over claims that Nginx does really not own the software acquired by F5 Networks when it bought their Russian company, which was registered in the British Virgin Islands. In a summary of the case in a search warrant, a Ministry of Interior investigator, E.A. Spirenkova, said Nginx’s popular software belonged to Rambler, a Russian internet and media holding company controlled by a state bank and a well-connected billionaire. Both Mr. Sysoyev and Mr. Konovalov worked previously at Rambler, which, according to the investigator, has “exclusive rights” to the software they sold. A criminal conspiracy to steal the software, the investigator said, had defrauded Rambler of 51 million rubles, around $810,000. In the face of the public outcry, Rambler executives disowned the criminal case. Writing on Facebook, Igor Ashmanov, Rambler’s former chief executive, dismissed the claims of theft as “frivolous” and “not based on anything at all,” a view echoed by many others in Russia’s IT sector. A group of former Rambler employees issued a statement saying they were “ashamed” of their former employer, accusing it of “intimidating business and trying to increase its capitalization by commandeering and misappropriating.” Assailed on social media and in the Russian press as a bullying behemoth bent on grabbing a share of the money paid by the American company, Rambler issued a statement on Monday insisting that it had played no role in initiating the criminal case against Nginx and wanted it stopped.  Disputes over intellectual property are a regular feature of the fiercely competitive IT sector around the world, but these are usually adjudicated by courts in civil proceedings. In Russia, such cases quickly escalate into criminal investigations featuring security officers waving guns. Powerful figures in business with connections to the Russian state often use the security forces to extort money or favors from weaker rivals.  Mr. Konovalov, one of the Nginx founders whose Moscow home was raided, denounced the police action in an interview with Meduza, a news portal, as a “typical racket. Simple as that.” He said the raids had been “professional and polite, if you exclude the fact that special forces agents were standing around with automatic weapons.” Contacted by The New York Times, he declined to comment about accusations that he and his partner, Mr. Sysoyev, had stolen Rambler’s intellectual property. Rambler, in a statement issued after an emergency board meeting on Monday, blamed Lynwood Investments, a Cyprus-registered company controlled by billionaire Aleksandr L. Mamut, a major shareholder in Rambler, for the criminal case against Nginx.  Rambler’s board ordered the company’s management to ask the law enforcement authorities to “terminate” the criminal case. Rambler’s chairman, Lev Khasis, said, “It’s natural for tech companies to defend their rights, but these issues should be decided by civil laws.” The decision by Rambler’s board to step away from the case does not automatically end the criminal investigation, but it does indicate that at least some powerful forces in Russian business — including the state-controlled bank Sberbank, which purchased a 46 percent stake in Rambler in August — want to put an end to the predatory practices that have done so much to stymie Russia’s economic development. The Kremlin, too, has tried to distance itself from the ruckus. President Vladimir V. Putin has for years insisted that Russia’s future economic health rests on exploiting its large reserves of scientific and technological talent but has done nothing to rein in law enforcement agencies that keep undermining this goal. Asked about the raids on Nginx’s founders, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said on Monday that the Kremlin was not involved and could not interfere. Russia, he added, “remains attractive for investment.” F5 Networks also distanced itself from the dispute, insisting in a statement that it was “currently not a party” to the criminal investigation unfolding in Moscow.  In a message to customers, it assured them that all of the disputed Nginx software it purchased was “stored on servers outside of Russia” and that “no other products are developed within Russia.” Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.']",A case linked to a $670 million acquisition shows that there may be a limit to the authorities’ abuse of law enforcement to advance corrupt business interests.
"The U.K. Election Explained, in One Number",2019-12-16,By Amanda Taub,"['LONDON — The answer to Brexit, the Conservative Party’s election victory and everything in British politics is (with apologies to Douglas Adams) 336,038. That number is what you get when you divide the 3,696,423 total votes cast nationally for the Liberal Democrats party in last week’s election by the 11 seats the party actually won. By contrast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson led his Conservative Party to victory via a far more economical average of 38,265 votes for each of its 365 seats — a roughly tenfold difference in the parties’ ability to translate votes cast into seats won. The Conservatives’ triumph and the Liberal Democrats’ disaster were both the result, in large part, of a factor that is rarely discussed but crucial for understanding the country’s political chaos: Britain, like the United States, operates a “first past the post” electoral system, in which parliamentary seats are awarded to the candidate who wins the most votes in each individual race, rather than by proportion of the total national vote. Brexit, which has polarized Britain around a new political divide since the 2016 referendum in which the country narrowly voted to leave the European Union, has thrown into sharp relief the ways that first-past-the-post systems can skew political outcomes. And so 336,038 also serves as an epitaph for the political career of Jo Swinson, the dynamic 39-year-old who was the leader of the Liberal Democrats until she lost her seat on Thursday. Just months ago she seemed triumphant, her party surging in the polls. But Thursday’s election put an end to those hopes.  The first-past-the-post system works well within a two-party system, but not where there are multiple parties. For Britain, that generally wasn’t a problem until Brexit fractured the long-stable coalitions of its two major political parties, creating an opening for challengers like the Liberal Democrats and Brexit Party.  “When you don’t have two parties, the first-past-the-post system is really bad at translating voter beliefs into seats,” said Sara Hobolt, a political scientist at the London School of Economics. That weakness was on display in the most recent election, in which the roughly half of the electorate who oppose leaving the European Union found that their votes had only a fraction of the power that votes for the pro-Brexit Conservatives did. Things looked very different last September, when Ms. Swinson took the stage at her party’s conference in Bournemouth, an old-fashioned resort town on the south coast of England. To rapturous applause, she promised a future that much of the country had hoped for since the 2016 referendum: If her party won power, she would stop Brexit. In a different political system, that might have been her moment. “There is a pattern to how small parties break through,” said Dr. Hobolt, a co-author of a coming book about challenger parties in Europe. “They find an issue that cuts across a mainstream party coalition and exploit it as a wedge.” Across much of Europe, the same issues at the heart of the Brexit debate, such as immigration and membership in the European Union, have been just such a wedge for small parties. In countries with proportional representation, the result has been a major party realignment: instead of two major parties, on the center left and center right, many countries now have four parties divided along both social and economic lines. In Germany, for instance, the Green Party on the far left and the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany on the far right have drawn support away from the center-left and center-right parties that have traditionally dominated politics. Though that means no party wins an outright majority, coalitions and compromise offer a way to reflect voter beliefs with relative accuracy. If Britain had a proportional system, the pro-Remain parties could have formed a coalition with a majority in Parliament. The Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party, the Greens and Labour, which all promised to stop Brexit directly or hold a new referendum offering that as an option, won over 50 percent of the votes between them. But under first past the post, things played out very differently. Instead of giving Remain voters the option of a powerful coalition government, the increased popularity of the Liberal Democrats and other small parties split the pro-Remain electorate, ultimately helping to hand victory to Mr. Johnson’s Brexiteers. For example, in Kensington and Wimbledon, wealthy districts of London that voted to remain in the 2016 referendum, Conservative candidates scraped to victory with less than 40 percent of the vote after Remain voters divided between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The European Parliament elections in May, by contrast, used a proportional system. Although the results are not directly comparable — voters tend to treat European elections as more of an expressive choice than a practical one — they did offer a hint of what a different system might bring. The British electorate was much more atomized, with the Brexit Party in first place with 30 percent of the vote, the Liberal Democrats second with just under 20 percent and then the Greens, Labour and the Conservatives clustered around 10 percent each.  But in first past the post, casting a vote outside of the two largest parties is a risky move. “Two-party systems are particularly problematic when you have the kind of crosscutting dimensions you have now,” Dr. Hobolt said. And, she added, “it’s really hard to break through as a third party in this kind of system.” Reflecting the will of the people can be political suicide. Which brings us to another mystery: Why weren’t Ms. Swinson and her party able to exert more influence over Labour’s Brexit platform, as the far-right Brexit party did over Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives? To stave off the Brexit Party threat, Mr. Johnson made support for Brexit by any means necessary a litmus test for Conservative politicians, going so far as to expel 21 legislators for voting to block a no-deal Brexit. But pressure from the Liberal Democrats did not have a similar effect on the Labour party. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, grudgingly agreed to hold a new referendum, but avoided focusing on the Brexit issue, instead emphasizing his party’s economic platform and commitment to expanding the welfare state. “That’s a geography story,” said Simon Hix, a political scientist at the London School of Economics who studies European politics. Brexit had divided the country along geographic as well as political lines: Large, cosmopolitan cities like London voted heavily to remain, while rural areas and postindustrial towns that have seen little benefit from globalization, including many traditional Labour strongholds, voted to leave. The result was that Conservative Remainers were concentrated in a smaller number of wealthy areas, mostly in London, leaving the Conservatives with relatively few seats to lose from alienating them. Labour Leave voters, on the other hand, were more spread out — putting many more Labour seats at risk. Mr. Corbyn tried to “have his cake and eat it,” Dr. Hix said, by prioritizing economic messages instead. But in an election where Brexit was the most salient issue, that strategy proved disastrously ineffective. Mr. Johnson’s promise to “get Brexit done” attracted leave voters in traditional Labour strongholds, winning those districts by often-narrow margins. Mr. Corbyn, meanwhile, failed to pick up areas like Wimbledon and Kensington where many wealthy Leave voters could not stomach his far-left economic policies and cast ballots for the Liberal Democrats. That may offer some lessons for the United States, which shares first past the post. “When you have all these liberal cosmopolitan voters piled up in urban areas, the left are winning those seats by massive margins,” Dr. Hix said. “But the right can win many more seats with smaller margins.” That helps to explain why immigration, transgender rights and other social issues, which are effective wedge issues in rural and postindustrial areas, have become so prominent in American politics. The United States does not have small party challengers akin to the Brexit Party or the Liberal Democrats. But its primary system offers an opportunity for populist challengers within the major parties to exploit wedge issues. That strategy propelled Donald Trump to victory in the 2016 Republican primary. “People say that the good thing about first-past-the-post systems is you don’t get radical-right parties,” Dr. Hobolt said. “But there’s a danger that the radical right wing of a party takes over.” The Interpreter is a column by Max Fisher and Amanda Taub exploring the ideas and context behind major world events.

"In France, Dying at Home Can Mean a Long Wait for a Doctor",2019-12-16,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['DOUAI, France — Her mother’s death had been expected. Terminally ill with breast cancer, she lay in a medical bed in her living room, visited daily by a nurse. But when Sandra Lambryczak’s 80-year-old mother died earlier this year, in the predawn hours of a Saturday morning, the daughter suddenly discovered a growing problem in France’s medical system: By law, the body couldn’t be moved until the death was certified by a medical doctor, but a shortage of personnel can sometimes force families to keep their deceased loved ones at home for hours or even days. “Madame, there’s nobody on weekends, there’s no doctor,” she was told when she called the emergency services. “I pleaded, ‘This can’t be true. We can’t leave a body until Monday morning.’” She turned off the heaters and flung open the windows. Police officers came, followed by the mayor of Monchecourt, the local municipality, solicitous but powerless in finding a doctor. Only half a day later, after her mother’s nurse was able to locate her personal physician, was the body allowed to be taken to the funeral home. Ms. Lambryczak said she still suffered sleepless nights because of what happened to her mother, Josiane Gaudig-Delos, adding, “Honestly, it was a nightmare.” Such agonizing waits have been occurring with increasing frequency around Douai, a city of 40,000 in northern France, and in other areas with a scarcity of physicians. A local newspaper summed up the situation in a headline: “It’s not good to die at home on a weekend.” Mayors, councilors, police officers, firefighters and other officials find themselves scrambling to help families find a willing doctor capable of coming to certify a death, though neither the government nor medical associations keep data that would indicate precisely how widespread these delays have become. Exasperated, one town issued a bylaw forbidding its residents to die at home. The mayor of Douai took a more conventional approach, recently writing to the health minister that he had faced four such cases in the past year and that desperate residents regularly called him for help in finding a doctor to certify a relative’s death. “This is a visible problem that is a symptom of something much more structural,” the mayor, Frédéric Chéreau, said in an interview. Nurses, coroners, pathologists and other officials can certify deaths in countries like the United States. But in France, where a quarter of the population dies at home, the role is reserved for medical doctors, who must visit the deceased’s home, verify that the death was natural and note its cause. It is system that functioned well when France had a surfeit of general practitioners, many of whom made house calls. Today, while an acute shortage of doctors in some areas has created what the French called “medical deserts,” the requirements for obtaining death certificates have essentially remained the same. “There’s an enormous gap,"" said Dr. Roland Crestel, a longtime general practitioner in Douai who helped establish an off-hours facility with on-call doctors in 2015. “It’s like the highway code was made for horse-drawn buggies and now we have cars that go 10 times faster. You’re going to crash.” About 8 percent of the country lives in a medical desert, according to the government, even as France’s overall number of doctors has kept rising and physicians cluster in metropolitan areas. Douai and the rest of northern France have been hit hard by the collapse in recent decades of their economic base, factories and mining. The situation in Douai — a city that still celebrates its rich medieval heritage and rode France’s postwar economic boom — is becoming “worrisome,"" Mayor Chéreau said. Though Douai is not classified as a medical desert, its general practitioners are aging, and replacements were insufficient, he said. The imbalance between the deserts and the overall increase in doctors has reinforced the sense of a widening gap between a thriving France and a peripheral, withering France — divisions that fueled the Yellow Vest protests and the rise of the far-right National Rally party, and cause daily hand-wringing in the news media. “We’ve never had so many doctors in France, and yet we have medical deserts where families have to keep a cadaver at home, and where they’re abandoned in both life and death,” said Christophe Dietrich, the mayor of Laigneville, a 4,500-resident town where the last two doctors retired in 2017. That year, Laigneville passed a bylaw prohibiting residents from dying at home after two families endured long waits in the summer heat to have the deaths of relatives certified, Mr. Dietrich said.  The move, intended to pressure national health authorities to find a physician in his region, had mixed results, he said: No doctor has arrived, but a telemedicine center was established. In France, where half of all family doctors are now over 55, officials are bracing for a big wave of retirements over the next decade. The French government is aiming to increase the number of doctors by eliminating a cap on the number of medical students next year and sending young doctors to underserved areas.  But the effect of the new cohorts is not expected to be felt for a decade, and young doctors are continuing to choose specialties over general practice. It is difficult to attract doctors to medical deserts — areas that also lack other services, said Dr. Marc Vogel, the vice president of the French Medical Council in Nord, the department that includes Douai. “Medical deserts are sometimes simply deserts,” he said. “Once there’s no longer a post office, a bank, or a school, it’s hard to still have a doctor.” Overburdened, the remaining doctors in underserved areas do not feel the obligation to go out of their way to certify the death of someone who was not a patient of theirs, some doctors said. The product of a time when the bond between doctor and patient was stronger, the act of certifying a death was considered a physician’s last duty — a free one that was not reimbursed by the national health insurance system. Since 2017, France has paid a flat rate of 100 euros, or $110, to doctors who certify a death at night, on weekends, holidays or in underserved regions. But the policy’s effects appear limited, some government and health officials said. Doctors have resisted pressure from some politicians to delegate the authority to certify deaths to other health care officials. They argue that it is a serious medical procedure and that a mistake in noting the cause of death could have legal consequences. “There are doctors, if they don’t know the patient well, say to themselves that they don’t want trouble later on,” said Dr. Olivier Bouchy, the vice president of the French Medical Council in the department of Meuse. “Signing a death certificate is not harmless.” As with many things in France, tradition is perhaps also an obstacle to changing the doctor’s role in certifying deaths. The death certificate process, Dr. Bouchy said, harked back to an earlier time. “Who declared a death in the royal court? It was the doctor of the king,” Dr. Bouchy said. “We remain rooted in very ancient traditions.” In France, the state’s role in regulating people’s daily lives — including in matters of health — remains strong. So the lack of a doctor, especially at the emotionally vulnerable moment when a family member dies, can feel like a deep betrayal. “We felt abandoned by the state,” said Frédéric Deleplanque, who had to wait more than two days for a doctor to certify the death of his father-in-law, Jean-Luc Bajeux, a retired autoworker. “We were nothing.” On a Saturday morning earlier this year, Mr. Deleplanque discovered his father-in-law, who had been ill, in his apartment in Douai, slumped in his wheelchair on his way to the toilet. He turned off the heat and the television before reaching an emergency operator on the phone. “He told me to touch my father-in-law to make sure he was dead,” Mr. Deleplanque recalled. “I told him he was deceased, but he insisted. So, there you go, I touched him, he’s cold.” “And all that for nothing,” he said, “because no doctor came.” Police officers and firefighters came to the apartment but were unable to help him find a doctor. On the Monday morning — by then his father-in-law’s body had started to suppurate — he called the police again: “I told them, it’s simple. I’m taking my father-in-law and putting him in the middle of the street.” Before he could carry out his threat, he was able to find a physician who had treated his father-in-law years ago. The doctor came and signed the death certificate, and his father-in-law was cremated the following day. The delays have also caused complications for funeral homes. Michel Tomczyk, the owner of the Tomczyk-Delebury funeral home in Douai, said he had dealt with a case in which a young man who died of a heart attack was found face down on the floor of his apartment on a Saturday. His body remained in that position until a doctor was found Monday, forcing the family to hold a closed-coffin funeral. “His parents couldn’t experience a proper mourning,” Mr. Tomczyk said.

Searchers Try to Find Earthquake Victims in Philippines,2019-12-16,By Jason Gutierrez,"['Rescuers on Monday raced to reach several people believed trapped inside a supermarket that crumbled as a magnitude-6.9 quake violently shook the southern Philippines this weekend, killing at least five people, officials said.  At least two people were killed when the store collapsed at the Southern Trade shopping center in the town of Padada, an impoverished community in the province of Davao del Sur, which bore the brunt of the temblor. “Rescuers were able to pull out two female bodies from the rubble” before dawn, said Francisco Guerrero, the vice mayor of Padada.  On Sunday, a 6-year-old girl was killed after a wall collapsed on her at a separate location. The government also reported two other people dying of heart attacks related to the quake.  Mr. Guerrero said that rescuers had deployed sensitive listening devices to try and detect any more signs of life in the rubble at the store. The quake was the third with a magnitude of 6.5 or higher to hit the area since late October. The quake struck near the heavily urbanized Davao City, President Rodrigo Duterte’s hometown, causing widespread panic there. Nearly 200 aftershocks followed throughout the night, the state seismology bureau said. The Office of Civil Defense reported that at least 49 people had been injured and more than 5,700 displaced.  The Philippines sits in the Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire, which is prone to earthquakes caused by movements in the tectonic plates. Mr. Duterte, who was in Davao City when the quake struck, ordered that all disaster relief officials and security forces be placed on a heightened state of alert and that they continue their work in recovery operations. “The national government, together with our local disaster risk reduction management offices, are definitely on top of the situation on this latest quake that hit Davao del Sur,” said Karlo Alexei Nograles, the secretary of the president’s cabinet. Senator Richard Gordon, who runs the local Red Cross operation, said first aid and trauma teams had provided assistance to several people, including a 39-year-old woman who was pinned down by a collapsed wall. He said additional ambulances and medical volunteers had been dispatched to the affected areas to help overwhelmed local medical units. “We are closely monitoring in our operations center to further assist the victims,” Mr. Gordon said.']","Two bodies were pulled from the rubble of a collapsed store on Monday, but searchers were looking for more after the powerful quake in the south."
"Boris Johnson Has a Mandate. Now, What Will He Do With It?",2019-12-17,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Five days after British voters handed Prime Minister Boris Johnson the greatest political mandate of any Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher, the country is still arguing over what he’s going to do with that power. Even after a campaign that Mr. Johnson made almost exclusively about Brexit, nobody knows what kind of relationship Mr. Johnson truly wants with the European Union, and so the theories abound. “A softer Brexit may well now happen,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party, he said, rode to victory on working-class voters, who will now pressure him to negotiate a closer long-term trading relationship with the European Union. Not so fast, said Simon Fraser, a former head of the British diplomatic service. Mr. Johnson’s victory, he said, signified the power of fast, simple answers, and the fastest, simplest one is to make a clean break from Europe. “I’m not at all convinced he wants to do a softer Brexit,” Mr. Fraser said. The debate has raged in newspaper columns, TV appearances and on social media — and it shows no sign of abating. It speaks to an election that was at once historically consequential and strangely inconclusive. On Tuesday, those who argue that Mr. Johnson will pursue a hard Brexit — a divorce without close ties — seized on the prime minister’s plans for legislation that would bar Britain from extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. That was proof, they said, that he was intent on breaking with the European Union, come what may. The pound, which soared after the election on hopes of an end to the uncertainty, fell back on fears that Britain could fail to come to terms with the European Union by the end of the transition period — triggering a so-called “no deal Brexit” that experts warn would be economically disastrous. But Mr. Travers interpreted the proposed law the other way. Why would Mr. Johnson rule out an extension to the trade negotiations, he said, unless his plan was for London and Brussels to end up in close alignment? The fierce postelection debate attests, first, to the fickleness and ideological elasticity of Mr. Johnson, who almost came out against Brexit in 2016 before throwing himself into the Leave campaign. It also speaks to the utter lack of substantive debate about the shape of Brexit during the campaign. Mr. Johnson never tired of promising to “get Brexit done,” but he steered clear of any explanation of how he would do it, or the trade-offs involved. The few times he did get into the details, he was often wrong. He erroneously claimed, for example, that companies shipping goods from Northern Ireland to a post-Brexit Britain would not have to fill out any additional customs paperwork, when the terms of his withdrawal agreement with the European Union will clearly require it. Not getting drawn into the details of Brexit was a deliberate strategy that emerged after some internal debate, said Brett O’Donnell, a Republican political consultant who advised the Conservatives during the campaign. “There was an instinct to relitigate the arguments on Brexit,” said Mr. O’Donnell, who prepared both George W. Bush and Mitt Romney for their presidential debates and coached Mr. Johnson when he led the Leave campaign in 2016. But Mr. O’Donnell and other senior advisers, including Mr. Johnson’s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, argued that, “It was not about relitigating the arguments over Brexit but channeling people’s frustration that it had not been done yet,” Mr. O’Donnell said. “The Brexit message is the gateway to every other message,” he added. It helped that the Labour Party’s position on Brexit was hopelessly muddled. In seeking to shift the debate to kitchen-table issues like health care or education, the party avoided the subject almost altogether. So, in an election ostensibly about Brexit, voters were never asked to confront to the essential question raised by Britain’s departure: What kind of trading relationship does Britain want with its largest neighbor?  But there is also little indication that the public ever wanted to have that debate. “It’s worth remembering just how weird Brexit is,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College in London. “It is an issue that has dominated our politics like no other for more than three years, and yet there is such fatigue with it.” “The British people are not aware of the huge differences in various Brexit models,” he continued. “They just want the politicians to sort it out.” With so little settled, Britain’s political establishment is casting about for clues in other places. The people Mr. Johnson chooses for his new Cabinet early next year might give a hint of intentions, Professor Menon said. If he replaces current ministers who are hard-line Brexiteers, like Priti Patel, the home secretary, or Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, that may suggest he wants closer relations with the European Union. Analysts are also looking at particular parts of the country where pressure on Mr. Johnson could mount from inside his own party.  In Stoke-on-Trent, for example, Conservatives now hold all three Parliamentary seats. The region is heavily dependent on ceramics and, hence, on trade with Europe. Those voters are likely to be hurt by a Brexit that is too hard, leaving Britain with few ties to the bloc. “The logic of the Conservative Party’s new base means that at least manufacturing needs to be protected as much as possible,” said Mr. Travers, the London School of Economics professor. “That gives Boris Johnson less room for a hard deal.” Mr. Johnson himself has given few clues since his victory. He said he recognized that the Conservative Party needed to serve working-class voters in the Midlands and the North, who had historically voted for the Labour Party but switched to the Tories out of frustration with the failure to complete Brexit. But he did not say whether the interests of those voters would have any effect on how he negotiated with the European Union — or, for that matter, how he planned to negotiate with the bloc at all. The government’s strategy, some said, will be to relegate the trade negotiations to technical groups, while Mr. Johnson focuses on more popular, headline-grabbing initiatives like funding the National Health Services or hiring more police officers. On Tuesday, as he spoke to his cabinet and later to Parliament, Mr. Johnson again stuck to generalities and a message of unity. “We must recognize that people lent us their votes at this election,” the prime minister said. “It was a seismic election, but we need to repay their trust and work 24 hours a day, work flat out to deliver on it.” “You ain’t seen nothing yet, folks,” Mr. Johnson promised, without giving a hint of what he had in mind.']","After a consequential but strangely inconclusive election, the prime minister still has not said what he means by Brexit."
France Extradites Argentine Man Suspected of Torture,2019-12-15,By Elian Peltier and Daniel Politi,"['A former police officer from Argentina who has lived for more than 30 years as a university lecturer and security expert in France was extradited and arrived on Monday in his native country, where he is wanted for crimes against humanity, including torture, committed during the country’s dictatorship, the French lawyer representing Argentina said. The news of the extradition of the former police officer, Mario Sandoval, was welcomed in Argentina by human rights activists and relatives of victims of the military regime, which killed up to 30,000 people, according to estimates, between 1976 and 1983.  But even as Mr. Sandoval was arrested at his home in a Paris suburb on Wednesday, many in France tried to fathom how a suspected torturer was able to live there for decades, teaching international affairs, participating in security conferences on Latin America and working with French security officials.  Prosecutors in Argentina have accused Mr. Sandoval, 66, of having participated in the death of an architecture student, Hernán Abriata, who disappeared in 1976 at a notorious secret detention center in Buenos Aires.  Argentine prosecutors believe he may also have been connected to the disappearance of many other civilians while he was a police officer in his 20s.  Argentina requested his extradition in 2012, but Mr. Sandoval denied the accusations and appealed every decision until he ran out of legal options. Last week, France’s top administrative court approved his extradition.  Mr. Sandoval appealed the decision to the European Court of Human Rights; his appeal was rejected. “It’s a relief and a delight to see Mr. Sandoval finally extradited,” said Sophie Thonon-Wesfreid, a French lawyer who has represented Argentina in the proceedings. “Hernán Abriata’s mother is 92, she’s been waiting for 43 years.” Mr. Sandoval’s lawyer, Jérôme Rousseau, said the trial his client would face in Argentina would be “political,” in a country that he said was undergoing a “purge.”  Since 2006, Argentina has undergone an enormous effort to punish former military officers and their accomplices. Courts have convicted 962 of the almost 3,300 people who have been accused of crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, and stealing babies from pregnant detainees and giving them up for adoption. Mr. Abriata was one of about 5,000 people who disappeared at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy, or ESMA, which was converted into Argentina’s largest clandestine detention center.  The former detention center is now a human rights memorial.  Some of those suspected of these crimes, like Mr. Sandoval, moved abroad after the end of the dictatorship, delaying their prosecution and extending the wait of family members who sought justice for their missing relatives. “This means the beginning of the end to his impunity, an impunity he enjoyed since the day he was in charge of a gang at the ESMA and kidnapped my brother,” said Laura Abriata, Mr. Abriata’s sister. \x08After Mr. Sandoval moved to France in 1985, he taught at the Université of Marne-la-Vallée, outside of Paris, and at the New Sorbonne University. He obtained French citizenship in 1997, according to his lawyer. At the New Sorbonne, he worked at the Institute of High Studies for Latin America, a highly regarded institution known for welcoming exiles who fled the dictatorships in Argentine, Brazil or Chile. Many of his colleagues felt Mr. Sandoval’s presence there had left a stain on the institute.  “It is pathetic that someone accused of crimes against humanity, a torturer, was allowed to train young people at university,” said Denis Merklen, a professor at the institute who, like Mr. Sandoval, holds French and Argentine citizenship.  Mr. Sandoval was hired as a lecturer at the institute in 1999, when France’s current education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, ran it. Through an aide, Mr. Blanquer denied knowing at the time Mr. Sandoval was hired, about the charges he is now facing.  For more than 20 years after the end of the dictatorship, two amnesty laws in Argentina protected officials involved in the regime’s crimes. The laws were overturned in 2005 — the same year Mr. Sandoval was dismissed from the New Sorbonne, although for reasons unrelated to the accusations he currently faces.  His name was connected to the crimes committed by the dictatorship in 2008, when the Argentine newspaper Página 12 published an investigation about him. Olivier Compagnon, a professor of contemporary history who ran the institute from 2015 to 2019 and taught an introductory class on Venezuela with Mr. Sandoval in 2003, said students complained that Mr. Sandoval was obsessed with weapons and security issues. He also questioned how the institute could have recruited someone who had so few qualifications.  Mr. Sandoval’s resume from the late 1990s, which The New York Times saw, starts in 1985 and states that he taught at a dozen institutions, but didn’t specify which universities he had attended.  “It’s nonsensical,” Mr. Compagnon said. “Today we would never hire someone with such a vague profile and resume.” Mr. Abriata’s relatives said they hoped justice could now be done.  “We expect a fair trial with all the legal guarantees so his constitutional rights are respected, which none of the 30,000 who were disappeared enjoyed,” Ms. Abriata, Hernán Abriata’s sister, said. Elian Peltier reported from London, and Daniel Politi from Buenos Aires.']","Mario Sandoval was sent to his native country to face charges of crimes committed during the dictatorship.

McDonald’s Closes Temporarily in Peru After Death of Teens,2019-12-17,By Julie Turkewitz,"['BOGOTÁ — They were two teenagers — once in love, now just friends — working the overnight shift at a McDonald’s in Lima, Peru, when they were electrocuted by a loose cable over the weekend. The deaths of Alexandra Porras Inga and Gabriel Campos Zapata inside a popular McDonald’s have shaken Peru, a nation already mired in a debate about how to tackle precarious labor conditions, particularly at the large companies that have aided Peru’s supercharged growth. And they come as McDonald’s faces increased scrutiny over treatment of workers around the world. In an interview on Monday, the mother of Ms. Porras Inga, Johana Inga Argote, 38, said that she last saw her daughter on Friday, after mass. On Sunday morning, Ms. Inga Argote received a call from a McDonald’s employee. “Ma’am, there’s been an accident,” the employee told her, she said. “Your daughter is dead.” When she hung up, she said, she began to scream. On Monday, Arcos Dorados, the company that runs McDonald’s in Peru, announced a two-day mourning period in which it would close all its restaurants in the country. “We share the sorrow and extreme pain of the affected families,” the company wrote in a statement, adding that it was cooperating fully with authorities to uncover what had happened.  McDonald’s, based in Chicago, said that safety was a “global priority” and that it was examining the matter with Arcos Dorados. Police have opened an investigation into the deaths. The restaurant where the teenagers died is located in Pueblo Libre, a middle-class district in Peru’s capital. It is owned by Arcos Dorados, a publicly-traded company that holds the exclusive right to operate McDonald’s franchises in at least 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The Pueblo Libre restaurant is open 24 hours on the weekends. Arcos Dorados has expanded precipitously in the region in recent years, and has more than 90,000 employees at more than 2,000 restaurants.  It has focused on hiring young people, advertising its ability to provide them with their first job and to have “transformative social impact” in Latin America. The company is led by Woods Staton, a Colombian-born businessman called “El hombre Big Mac” by some Colombian press. He has ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world.  Ms. Porras Inga, 18, aspired to be a lawyer and judge. She began working at McDonald’s about three months ago in an effort to pitch in with bills at home, according to her family. She was her mother’s only daughter. She met Mr. Campos Zapata in school, and they had dated for a time, her family said. Her mother said that after receiving news of her daughter’s death, she rushed to the locale, where, from afar, she could see wet floors, loose cables and her daughter’s body. The teenager did not appear to be wearing boots, gloves or other safety equipment, she said. She urged McDonald’s to make sure its employees, particularly young ones with little work experience, “receive what they need to stay safe.""  “Don’t let them die,” she said. “Take care of them.” Ms. Porras Inga’s family believes she was washing the floor when she hit a loose wire.  In Peru, the deaths have quickly become part of a larger conversation about workplace conditions.  Peru has seen tremendous, albeit unequal, growth in the last decade, and many in the nation of more than 30 million have clamored to make it into the nation’s expanding middle class.  Jobs in the informal sector remain the most readily available — meaning that work at global franchises, often at companies in new shopping malls, can feel like a shiny, stable road to a better future.  But critics say that the appeal of these jobs has left workers, particularly young workers, open to exploitation. In 2016, a fire in a cinema at a mall called Larcomar, owned by a Chilean company, killed four workers who were trapped inside. Some were found just feet from blocked exits.  More recently, a worker was killed by an explosion at a mall called Jockey Plaza, and a young man arriving for a job interview was run over by a truck at a shopping center called Real Plaza Salaverry. The deaths this weekend at McDonald’s led many young Peruvians to social media, where they shared their own stories of dangerous conditions at companies across the country. On Monday, Peru’s workplace safety department, the Superintendencia Nacional de Fiscalización Laboral, said it had begun an investigation into conditions at the restaurant, and that the fast food chain could face its highest fine — up to 189,000 soles, or about $56,000 — if violations were found. But some said the country is not doing enough to ensure safe working conditions. Indira Huilca, a former congresswoman who has made labor a priority, said the country has concentrated on attracting private investment while neglecting worker safety.  Many politicians see policies that promote inspections and fines as obstacles to investment, she said. As a result, she added, “everyone knows” that many Peruvians, and in particular young people, work in dangerous conditions. McDonald’s faces heightened scrutiny for labor conditions around the world.  In recent years McDonald’s and its franchises have been hit with dozens of sexual harassment complaints, including a new lawsuit that accuses the company of “pervasive problems of sexual harassment,” in the United States.  Workers have also begun striking in cities around the globe, calling for better wages. And in November, the company agreed to pay $26 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the chain of underpaying United States workers at corporate-owned restaurants in California. The suit involved 38,000 employees. Reporting was contributed by Elda Cantú in Mexico City and Jenny Carolina González in Bogotá.']","The workers were electrocuted by a loose cable over the weekend, raising questions about labor conditions at the franchise."
"Amid Chaos of Daily Commutes, Strikers and Macron Compete for the Commuters",2019-12-17,By Adam Nossiter and Mélissa Godin,"['PARIS — It was 5:50 in the afternoon in the Charles de Gaulle station on the RER A, the train that penetrates the suburbs of Paris. The crowd was already five deep. Only a narrow passageway remained on the platform. “Yeah, yeah, they’re coming very slowly,” a woman murmured into her cellphone. A train finally entered. The faces were grim, anxious or resigned. The crowd surged forward but hope quickly dissipated: The train was already full. Only the lucky few at the front squeezed in. The luck was relative. A passenger looked heavenward as the doors closed tightly on her, her face squeezed against the glass. There wasn’t an inch to spare. Thirteen days into the strike that has upended life in France, this was rush hour in the heart of Paris: few trains and too many passengers. Commuters awake early, return late, walk for miles to their jobs, get stuck in monstrous traffic jams that have turned Paris streets into impenetrable traps, or bicycle to work in bike lanes that are now anarchic free-for-alls. Bike and scooter accidents are up 40 percent since the start of the strike. “This is just abusive,” said Jennifer Salles, 23, who had been waiting 25 minutes for her chance at a train on the RER A platform. “I understand their demands, but this is all a big pain for us,” said Ms. Salles, a trainee in a corporate-nursery program. “I think most people are fed up.” Just how fed up is the question before France. The crowds, the delays, the interminable gridlock are more than an inconvenience. They are part of a tug of war for public support between the strikers who want to preserve the most sacred French benefit of all — a cozy but complex pension system — and a government determined to overhaul it. Caught in the middle are France’s frazzled commuters, whose endurance — the strength of their fraying nerves — may ultimately determine who wins.  The government is banking that anger at the strikers for making life miserable will tip the scales of public opinion in its favor. So far that is not happening.  Public support for the strike runs at 62 percent in a poll published Tuesday by Harris Interactive, a number that increased since the beginning of the protests.  With some 615,000 in the streets across France on Tuesday, according to the government, it was the biggest demonstration since the first nationwide protest on Dec. 5. The continuing strength of the mobilization was not good news for the government of President Emmanuel Macron. And precedent doesn’t favor the government either — in 1995, reforms were withdrawn after three weeks of publicly supported strikes. Yet for now, no end is in sight. Most unions have brushed aside pleas for a Christmas “truce,” and the government signaled on Tuesday that it had no intention of backing down. “On this project my determination is total,” Prime Minister Édouard Philippe told the French Parliament on Tuesday. “I say it calmly: It is total.”  With the ratio of active workers to retirees at only 1.7 to 1, compared to 4 to 1 in 1960, the current system is simply unaffordable, the government says. The 70-year-old pensions system, officials say, is heading for big deficits and is unfair to some, and too fair to others.  It features official retirement at 62, and 52 for train drivers, pensions based on the best 25 years in the private sector and the last six months of salary in the public.  The government wants to combine France’s current byzantine system, in which many professions have their own retirement schemes, into one state-managed plan, and to nudge the retirement age up by two years. The special pension regimes had to go, Mr. Philippe said.  But the numbers and the warnings don’t mean much to a public used to the state’s generosity, even as the impact of the strikes mounts.  In central Paris, business in shops and restaurants has fallen over 40 percent. “Business is down. There are fewer customers, even tourists,” said Guénolé Aubert, who runs a pharmacy at the Place de Clichy, normally one of the busiest spots in Paris. But while the shopping crowds were thin, elsewhere in the city on Tuesday the streets were thick with demonstrators from every profession and activity: employees at the Louvre, sewer workers, train drivers, lawyers, students, teachers, judges, doctors, nurses, and prison guards. “Musicians and dancers with the workers,” read one banner; “Girls just wanna have a good salary, a good career, a good retirement,” read another. “Make Our Retirements Great Again,” read a third.  All had come out to express their fury at the government for daring to fix what many believe is not broken. While costly, the current pension regime guarantees the French an unequaled level of security in retirement with one of the lowest old-age poverty rates among countries tracked by the O.E.C.D.  Since the strike began on Dec. 5, centrist writers and analysts in France have again marveled at their compatriots’ passion for retirement, and the apparent lesser place accorded to the world of work.  In the magazine Le Point, the writer Pascal Bruckner criticized “the astonishing spectacle of high school students demonstrating for their pensions.”  But previous government efforts to change the pension system have elicited similar passions. “They’ve got to pull their plan and work with what we’ve already got,” Philippe Martinez, leader of the hard-left CGT union, leading the strike, told reporters at the head of Tuesday’s march across Paris. On Monday, Mr. Macron suffered a sharp blow when his pensions reform czar, Jean-Paul Delevoye, the reform’s mastermind, was forced to resign over conflicts of interest, a government setback that the unions greeted with glee. The big movement against the government’s pension reform has touched two fundamental aspects of contemporary French life: unease over the future and a dyed-in-the-wool belief that the street is the best place to challenge policy.  “We have to try to change things, and unfortunately, it has to be done by striking and protesting,” said Amelie Devalckeneer, a 33-year-old teacher wearing a symbolic yellow vest, in homage to the protests earlier this year. “It’s the only way we can be heard.” Even in the misery of the RER A platform this week, there was support for the anti-pensions reform movement. “I’m with the strikers. The government has changed the rules in the middle of the game,” said Stephane Castex, who works in a bank’s information technology department. He had just failed to get on an overcrowded train. “I’m putting myself in their place,” said Mr. Castex. “I would fight like this if I was them. They signed a contract, and were given benefits. And now they’re losing those benefits.” Rita Chahine, a freelance fashion designer, hopped on the last suburban train in from the Val d’Europe. She had been stuck at home for two weeks, but couldn’t afford to stay away from work any longer. She was not angry. “I support everything that is going to make the future, the country and the people better,” she said. “But it’s true that we are penalized right now.” Amable Ceciliane, an 18-year-old cashier at the huge Bon Marché department and food store on the Left Bank, had commuted three hours into work in Paris on Tuesday, and was facing the same commute that evening. She supports the strikers. “They’re doing this for us as well. So even if it’s annoying, I still support them.” Still, there are some who are not so sure. Twice the crowds had kept Franck Legrand from boarding on the RER A platform. “You can’t reform France,” said Mr. Legrand, who had already walked from his job in the central Invalides district.  “This is not progress, this movement,” he said. “People can’t take this much longer.” Daphne Angles and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting. ']",The government is banking that anger at the strikers for making life miserable will tip the scales of public opinion in its favor. So far that is not happening. 
Strong Earthquake Hits the Southern Philippines,2019-12-15,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — An earthquake measuring magnitude 6.9 rocked the southern Philippines on Sunday afternoon, causing scenes of panic and killing at least one child and injuring a least 15 others, officials said. Vincent Fernandez, the mayor of the town of Matanao, told local radio that a 6-year-old girl died after a wall collapsed on her during the powerful earthquake. The United States Geological Survey said the quake’s epicenter was near the town of Magsaysay in the populated province of Davao del Sur on Mindanao island. A second quake, a magnitude-5.7, followed not long after. The initial earthquake was the third of magnitude 6.5 or higher to hit the area, southwest of Davao City, since late October. Those two earlier quakes, which struck over the course of three days, as well as two others in October and November, left more than 20 people dead.  Because of its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions caused by the movement of tectonic plates. On Sunday, the Philippine Information Agency reported that shoppers and employees were believed to be trapped inside a collapsed store in the town of Padada. Flower vendors at a market in Padada were also trapped by a collapsed wall, according to a local radio station. Photographs on social media showed several people trying to extricate them. Other photos showed damaged buildings and cracked roads. “It was so strong; the house shook and swayed. We immediately rushed out,” said Aldrin Tumanda, a hotel worker in the area. “It felt as strong as the previous earthquakes.” He said neighbors in his community also rushed out of their homes, but returned after several minutes.']","A 6-year-old girl died after a wall collapsed on her during the powerful quake, the third of magnitude 6.5 or higher to strike the area since late October."
Top U.S. Envoy Warns North Korea Against Weapons Tests,2019-12-16,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The top United States envoy on North Korea warned on Monday that if Pyongyang conducted a major weapons test in the coming days as feared, it would be “most unhelpful,” as Washington tried to de-escalate tensions with the country. “We are fully aware of the strong potential for North Korea to conduct a major provocation in the days ahead,” Stephen E. Biegun, Washington’s top representative on North Korea, said during a news conference in Seoul. “Such an action will be most unhelpful in achieving a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.” Mr. Biegun, who was recently also appointed the State Department’s No. 2 official, met with senior South Korean officials in Seoul on Monday amid signs that North Korea was preparing to launch a satellite or flight-test an intercontinental ballistic missile. In the last 10 days, the country has conducted two tests that it called “very important” or “crucial” to improve what it called its “strategic nuclear deterrent.”  Officials and analysts in the region say those tests — at its missile engine and satellite-launch sites near the border with China — most likely involved a new booster engine and other technologies used to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. That is raising fears that the North is moving rapidly toward reactivating its long-range nuclear missile program, whose advancement led to a crisis with Washington two years ago. On Monday, President Trump said that the United States was watching North Korea “very closely,” and that “I’d be disappointed if something would be in the works.” “If it is we will take care of it,” he added. North Korea has resumed its weapons activities while warning that it would abandon diplomacy and might restart nuclear and long-range missile tests if Washington doesn’t make more concessions, such as lifting sanctions, by Dec. 31.  On Monday, Mr. Biegun dismissed that deadline, while stressing that the United States was ready for serious negotiations to produce a denuclearization deal that could satisfy both Washington and Pyongyang. “Let me be absolutely clear: The United States does not have a deadline,” he said. But he also appealed to his counterparts in Pyongyang.  “It is time for us to do our jobs,” he said of efforts to reach a deal on denuclearization. “Let’s get this done. We are here, and you know how to reach us.” There has been speculation that Mr. Biegun was hoping to meet with North Korean officials on the inter-Korean border this week. And his appeal on Monday was seen as an open invitation to such a meeting, but there was no immediate response from North Korea. When Kim Jong-un met President Trump in Singapore in June 2018, the North Korean leader promised to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” in return for “new” relations and security guarantees from Washington. But their two subsequent meetings, as well as lower-level talks between the two sides, have failed to make progress on carrying out the Singapore deal. During their meeting in Hanoi in February, Mr. Trump rejected Mr. Kim’s demand that all major United Nations sanctions be lifted in return for the dismantlement of one of the North’s key nuclear fuel production facilities, but not its nuclear warheads.  North Korea has since sounded increasingly impatient, accusing Washington of trying to stall negotiations as Mr. Trump remains preoccupied with a congressional attempt to impeach him and even reviving an old insult against the American leader, calling him a “dotard.” Mr. Trump tweeted last week that the North should not “interfere” in November’s election. Mr. Kim is widely expected to use a meeting of his Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, scheduled for this month, and his annual New Year’s Day speech to reveal his new policy options.  On Monday, Mr. Biegun lamented that the recent North Korean statements had been “so hostile and negative and so unnecessary,” and said they reflected “neither the spirit nor the content of the discussions” both sides had recently held. In these meetings, Mr. Biegun said, his team has offered “any number of creative ways to proceed with feasible steps and flexibility.”  But that failed to satisfy North Korea. The country has resumed testing mostly short-range ballistic missiles and rockets since May, though Mr. Trump has largely dismissed such tests as involving weapons that do not directly threaten the United States.  But if North Korea returns to launching satellites or testing ICBMs, it would unambiguously contradict Mr. Trump’s assertion that he has largely resolved the North’s nuclear threat and could rekindle a crisis in the midst of the president’s re-election campaign.']","Stephen E.

Afghan Warlord Escapes Arrest as Troops Turn City into War Zone,2019-12-16,By Najim Rahim and Mujib Mashal,"['MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan — For nearly 24 hours, the center of Mazar-i-Sharif, one of Afghanistan’s economic hubs, became a front line for a battle that included machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and helicopter gunships. And it didn’t even involve the Taliban. Elite Afghan forces on Sunday surrounded the compound of Nizamuddin Qaisari, an abusive militia commander, who was resisting arrest with about 150 of his fighters, police officials said. Residents fled the neighborhood as the two sides shelled each other in a city that has long been safe from the broader war. Close to midnight on Sunday, a full 24 hours after the battle had begun, the police commandos cleared their way through a large garden and into the compound. The battle had led to the death of at least eight of Mr. Qaisari’s men and the arrest of 30 others. Mr. Qaisari, however, was nowhere to be found, apparently having sneaked to safety.  It was the latest embarrassment in an often-politicized crackdown on militias in a country rife with them. But this one came at a particularly fragile time in Afghanistan, as an election dispute simmers to a full-blown political crisis, testing the country’s ethnic and regional fracture lines.  Mr. Qaisari’s saga, which has dragged for years, has all the elements of what has undermined 18 years of American efforts to establish a new system in Afghanistan — abuses, militia turf wars, and politicized justice. Mr. Qaisari was a district police chief in northern Faryab Province when he was accused of using his hundreds of armed men on the government payroll to extort locals. Last year, he was lured into a trap by a security delegation visiting from Kabul. When he resisted surrender, a shootout ensued, reportedly resulting in the death of at least four of his men. He was eventually caught, loaded onto a plane and brought to Kabul.  President Ashraf Ghani declared his arrest, along with two other strongmen from other parts of the country, a major victory.  “I tied the hands of three strongmen and brought them to Kabul,” Mr. Ghani said at the time. Soon after, videos emerged showing government forces committing abuses after the arrest, with footage showing soldiers kicking the faces of bloodied detainees whose hands were tied. Angry protests erupted across Faryab. The provincial governor’s offices were burned down.  Mr. Qaisari was such a major criminal that all the risk was worth it, officials said. Still, months later, Mr. Qaisari was suddenly free, holding rallies in the north and conducting television interviews surrounded by the gun-toting guards whom the government had declared outlaw militiamen. The country’s attorney general’s office went silent on what the charges against him had been in the first place. Even some of Mr. Ghani’s closest allies are not clear on just how Mr. Qaisari walked free. But there are two scenarios on how Mr. Qaisari, an ethnic Uzbek, managed to return to the north from the custody of the Afghan intelligence agency.  One scenario is that Mr. Ghani was gearing for re-election and needed Uzbek votes. He had already lost the support of his vice president, the Uzbek strongman Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, whom he had forced into exile after General Dostum was accused of raping a political opponent while vice president. Mr. Qaisari’s roaming free in the north could be seen as a political check on General Dostum, or at least as a complication for him.  Supporting the theory is Mr. Qaisari’s comments immediately after he was out: He accused General Dostum, his onetime mentor, of cooking up the conspiracy for his arrest.  “It is just a political game,” said Sebghatullah Selab, a member of the Faryab provincial council. “The Afghan government arrested him a year back, before the election, and wanted to use him against General Dostum. But that process was a failure.” Two Afghan officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information, said there was a simpler answer, however: that Mr. Qaisari had escaped the custody of the Afghan intelligence. To cover the embarrassment, the rumors of a political deal or even the release of Mr. Qaisari on bail were floated, the officials said.  In any case, Mr. Qaisari returned to his old abuses, and did not even support Mr. Ghani in the elections.  This time, Mr. Qaisari set up shop in the northern commercial hub of Mazar-i-Sharif and got into repeated turf wars with militia commanders loyal to Atta Mohammed Noor. Mr. Noor is a former warlord and longtime governor of Balkh who was also removed by Mr. Ghani in another protracted, messy showdown. But in recent months Mr. Noor has come out as a political supporter of Mr. Ghani’s campaign to gain another term as president.  Two security officials said that what had led to Mr. Qaisari’s latest arrest was his grabbing land and then resisting the police when they went to question him about it.  Other officials suggested that the arrests were potentially tied to a turf war between Mr. Qaisari and Mr. Noor, and represented the central government’s backing of Mr. Noor. Just before Sunday’s raid, photos were published showing Mr. Noor at meetings held by Mr. Ghani and his top cabinet officials.  It appeared that after Sunday’s raid on his compound, Mr. Qaisari made his way to General Dostum’s stronghold in Jawzjan Province. “General Dostum accepted him with open arms,” said Najibullah Hashemi, a spokesman for General Dostum, adding that Mr. Qaisari had apologized for opposing his former mentor.

"Pervez Musharraf, Former Pakistani Leader, Sentenced to Death",2019-12-17,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — After years of delays and disruptions, a special court in Pakistan on Tuesday sentenced the country’s former military dictator, Pervez Musharraf, to death in a treason case.  But the sentence is more symbolic in nature, as Mr. Musharraf is currently in self-imposed exile in Dubai and is unlikely to return to the country. Nevertheless, the sentence marked the first time in the country’s history that a military dictator has been held accountable for his actions while in power.  A three-member special court panel announced that Mr. Musharraf “has been found guilty of Article 6 for violation of the Constitution of Pakistan,” namely, high treason and subverting the Constitution. Two judges decided in favor of the guilty verdict while one disagreed. Mr. Musharraf, 76, was accused of subverting the country’s Constitution in 2007 when he imposed a state of emergency in the country in an attempt to thwart a political opposition movement and also fired much of the judiciary. The movement had greatly weakened Mr. Musharraf, and he resigned in 2008 under a threat of impeachment. The treason case was initiated in 2013 by the government of Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister who has a history of animosity toward the former military ruler. Mr. Musharraf toppled Mr. Sharif’s government in 1999 in a bloodless coup and ruled until 2008.  But as Mr. Musharraf’s fortunes tumbled, Mr. Sharif’s rose; he managed to make a political comeback and returned to power in 2013. Within months, his government announced that it was initiating a treason case against the former military dictator. Mr. Musharraf has denied the charges and insisted that the case against him was a political vendetta. Officials in his political party, All Pakistan Muslim League, said they planned to appeal against the court sentence. Hours after the verdict, the top military commanders met at an emergency session at the General Headquarters of the Pakistani army in Rawalpindi and in a sharply worded statement expressed solidarity with their former chief. The military said that the court decision was received with a “lot of pain and anguish by the rank and file of Pakistan armed forces.” Mr. Musharraf, who held all top military positions, and “fought wars for the country can surely never be a traitor,” the statement read.  The treason case against Mr. Musharraf was groundbreaking in many ways. None of the country’s military dictators had ever before been held accountable for their actions. And Mr. Sharif sought to use the treason case to assert civilian supremacy over the military, a powerful institution in Pakistan. The country’s military, however, balked at the move.  Mr. Musharraf did not appear in the initial proceedings of the treason case, and before one hearing, in 2014, his security convoy was suddenly and mysteriously directed to a military hospital. Mr. Musharraf was then hospitalized as he complained of chest pains, but it was widely believed that the military was protecting its former chief from prosecution. In 2016, Mr. Musharraf was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. He said he would return and face the legal cases, but he failed to do so. Earlier this month, Mr. Musharraf released a video message from a hospital in Dubai where he was undergoing medical treatment and complained of being treated unjustly.  “I have served Pakistan all my life and I am being tried for treason,” a frail and weak looking Mr. Musharraf said. Mr. Musharraf once enjoyed broad support both in Pakistan and abroad, and was considered an important ally of the United States in its effort to root out terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But his popularity dropped sharply in 2007 as he tried to maintain his grip on power and clashed with the country’s judiciary and political opposition. The Deputy South Asia Director of Amnesty International, Omar Waraich, said in a statement that Mr. Musharraf and his government officials must be held accountable but expressed reservations over the death penalty. “No one is above the law,” Mr. Waraich said. But, he added, “the death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment; it metes out vengeance, not justice.”']",The Pakistani court’s sentence is unlikely to be carried out because Mr. Musharraf is no longer in the country.
How Russian Propaganda Showed Up in an Italian Murder Trial,2019-12-17,By Anna Momigliano,"['ROME —\xa0Few disputed the guilt of Vitaly Markiv, a Ukrainian who also holds Italian citizenship, when an Italian court sentenced him to 24 years in prison this summer. Most of the evidence showing that he had helped coordinate an artillery strike in a conflict zone of his native country, killing an Italian war photographer, had been retrieved from his electronic devices. But it raised eyebrows when the court released its reasoning in the fall showing that among the evidence presented by Italian prosecutors were reports from publications that are generally considered outlets for Russian propaganda. Experts say the inclusion of two videos from Russia Today, plus a report on the website Russkaya Vesna that the Ukrainian government said was false, raised questions about the extent to which fake news, after infiltrating the West’s news media and elections, is now penetrating its courts. “Contamination is by its nature expansive,” said Luciano Floridi, a professor of philosophy and the ethics of information at Oxford who has studied the effects of disinformation. And it can easily spread from media and politics to the judiciary, he added. Prosecutors said they did not consider the Russia Today reports decisive in the verdict, and members of the jury are not permitted to discuss what convinced them of Mr. Markiv’s guilt.  But the inclusion in court of the propaganda and disinformation, regardless of its persuasiveness, has raised alarm with experts and some politicians. In November,  the Ukrainian government, which was made a co-defendant in the case and thus liable for economic damages, appealed the decision. It has engaged in its own propaganda war with Russia and has routinely blamed Russian disinformation for anything that puts its military in a bad light.  This month, the liberal party, More Europe, argued that the trial was tainted by “hearsay and prejudices” and asked the European Union to send observers to the appeal trial, which is expected to begin this spring. Mr. Markiv, now 30, left Italy to take part in the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv in 2014. When the war erupted in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region a few months later, he joined Ukraine’s National Guard to fight against Russian separatist forces. While a guardsman, prosecutors charged, he helped coordinate an attack by a Ukrainian Army unit against a group of civilians. Among the group was the Italian photographer Andrea Rocchelli, 30, who was killed by the artillery fire along with other journalists on May 24, 2014. For two years, an inquiry by investigators in Pavia, Mr. Rocchelli’s hometown, led nowhere, because of a lack of cooperation from the Ukrainian authorities, said the prosecutor in the case, Andrea Zanoncelli. But in the summer of 2016, Mr. Zanoncelli said, a Google search led him to an article published by Italy’s leading daily newspaper, Corriere della Sera. It was a purported interview with an unidentified captain from the Ukrainian army stationed in the area. “Don’t come here, it’s a strategic area,” the captain was quoted as saying. “Usually we don’t shoot toward the city or at civilians, but as soon as we see anything move, we fire heavy artillery. That’s what happened with the two journalists and their interpreter.” The prosecutor saw it as an admission of guilt, despite Italian journalism’s usual lack of rigor. When the police questioned the article’s author, the journalist told them that the purported interview was a compilation of remarks she had heard in a conversation between the soldier and a photographer.  The Italian police subsequently determined that the anonymous army captain was Mr. Markiv. The Italian authorities began tapping Mr. Markiv’s conversations with his mother in Italy to gain evidence. They arrested him and charged him with murder as he returned to a Bologna airport in June 2017. The case drew high-profile lawyers and became a rallying cry for press freedom. A senator from Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party defended Mr. Markiv. The former left-wing mayor of Milan represented two prominent media guilds, which presented themselves as injured parties, on behalf of the photojournalist. Among the evidence presented were videos described as “open source,” “found on YouTube” or “from a local TV station,” all of which bore the logo of Russia Today and are still found on its YouTube channel. The ruling also cites an article in Russkaya Vesna, alleging that Ukraine’s Interior Ministry conspired with Mr. Markiv’s fellow guardsmen to protect him. It included a document, purportedly leaked from the Ukrainian authorities, instructing Mr. Markiv’s comrades to testify in his favor.  The Ukrainian government said the document was a forgery. “Our interior minister intervened personally to make it clear that the thing was fake,” said Yaroslav Moshkola, an official from the Ukrainian Embassy in Rome. “It’s very strange that the court accepted this document.” The conviction of Mr. Markiv caused outrage in Ukraine. Media outlets and nationalist politicians have sought to exonerate him by discrediting the Italian legal system with claims that the trial in Pavia was tainted by “anti-Ukrainian” bias and Russian propaganda. The prosecutor, Mr. Zanoncelli, said that the article was not pivotal in discrediting the witnesses called by the defense. “They were disproved because they contradicted one another,” he said.  As for the document it cited, he said that “it was never clear how genuine it was” and that he had presented it “to show this thing existed, so that the court could evaluate it.” The jurors wrote in the final ruling that Mr. Markiv’s fellow guardsmen “were instructed to give pre-agreed answers” and that the Russkaya Vesna article “contains some elements that seemed to be pointing toward the truth.” Without addressing Mr. Markiv’s guilt or innocence, Serena Quattrocolo, a law professor at Eastern Piedmont University whose expertise is in the digital distortion of evidence in court, said that more broadly, the inclusion of material found online from disputable sources in Italian courts was “part of an unsettling scenario and of larger problem.” Russia has spread disinformation online as a part of a broader strategy to destabilize the West. The United States Department of Justice has accused a Russian organization linked to the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 elections. Russian-backed groups carried out a disinformation campaign in Europe ahead of the European Union elections in May, according to a report issued by the European Commission. And Kremlin-backed influence networks targeting African countries were recently discovered and taken down by Facebook. Analysts believe the networks could serve as a test for next year’s elections in the United States. Italy is particularly vulnerable. According to Italy’s Authority of Communication, disinformation is growing in the country, although it has not been directly linked to Russia. The lines between mainstream outlets and propaganda are often blurred. The current chair of Italy’s state television broadcaster RAI has spread conspiracy theories online and has been frequently interviewed by Russia Today and Sputnik. In September, the private broadcaster Mediaset aired a “deep fake video,” which used seamless visual effects to doctor speech by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The appearance of Russian propaganda in court crosses a new threshold, a challenge for which Italy may not be fully prepared.  Mr. Markiv is appealing the verdict, which also demanded that Ukraine pay reparations to Mr. Rocchelli’s parents, widow and young son and to the two journalists’ guilds. Paolo Perucchini, who heads one of those guilds, the Lombardy journalists association, praised the verdict as a demonstration that “information is valued in our country.”  Asked about the inclusion of anonymously sourced reporting and Russia Today into evidence, he seemed unbothered. “It’s not up to me to decide if Russia Today spreads fake news,” he said. “Even a broken clock is right twice a day.” ']","The evidence has raised alarms about the extent to which fake news, having infiltrated the West’s media and elections, is penetrating its courts."
"China Commissions 2nd Aircraft Carrier, Challenging U.S. Dominance",2019-12-17,By Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — China commissioned its first domestically built aircraft carrier on Tuesday, reaching a new milestone in its ambitions to build a modern navy capable of challenging American dominance of the seas, especially in the Pacific. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, presided over a commissioning ceremony at the Chinese naval base in Sanya, on the southern island of Hainan, where the vessel will be based, according to video broadcast on China’s state television. From there, the new carrier will be able to project power throughout the disputed islands of the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait — a development that has been watched warily by the United States and other Pacific powers, including Japan and Australia. “This is a major milestone for China,” said Matthew P. Funaiole, a senior fellow with the China Power Project at the Center For Strategic and International Studies in Washington who tracks the country’s military developments. “There are only a handful of countries capable of fielding aircraft carriers, and China now has two, which puts it in elite company.” China has already begun a third carrier at a shipyard near Shanghai, and there are reports of plans for a fourth, which would make it second only to the United States, which currently has 10 aircraft carriers in service. The new carrier, called the Shandong, is modeled after China’s first, the Liaoning, which was purchased from Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union for $20 million and furtively refurbished.  Liaoning joined the fleet of the People’s Liberation Army Navy in 2012, and while not yet tested in combat operations, it has provided the Chinese extensive experience in conducting difficult carrier operations, according to the Pentagon’s latest annual report on Chinese military power. Both carriers are named after provinces in northeastern China. The new one is largely based on the first one’s Soviet-era design — with a distinctive sloping ramp for takeoffs — but it is believed to have included technological enhancements.  It was first put to sea in 2018 but appeared to endure difficulties during its sea trials that delayed its commissioning. As construction finished, the former general manager of the company that built it in the northern port city of Dalian, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, was arrested, tried and convicted of corruption. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison in July. The new carrier is designed to carry 36 J-15 fighter jets — the Liaoning has a capacity of 24 — as well as other aircraft and helicopters. The J-15s, also copied from Soviet designs, have suffered a series of crashes that have called into question the country’s mastery of the technological challenges of naval aviation. China’s two carriers are less sophisticated than the nuclear-powered fleet of the United States, but as symbols of global military power, they are significant achievements for a military that had for decades focused principally on land warfare.  Since taking office in 2012, Mr. Xi has overseen a sweeping modernization program of the powerful, tradition-bound military in China, and the huge expansion of the navy has been a centerpiece. The navy “continues to develop into a global force, gradually extending its operational reach beyond East Asia into a sustained ability to operate at increasingly longer ranges,” the Pentagon’s report said.']",A significant milestone in Xi Jinping’s ambitious drive to turn China into a naval power able to dominate the waters of the South China Sea and beyond.
"As Protests Rage on Citizenship Bill, Is India Becoming a Hindu Nation?",2019-12-16,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Maria Abi-Habib,"['NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has rounded up thousands of Muslims in Kashmir, revoked the area’s autonomy and enforced a citizenship test in northeastern India that left nearly two million people potentially stateless, many of them Muslim. But it was Mr. Modi’s gamble to pass a sweeping new citizenship law that favors every South Asian faith other than Islam that has set off days of widespread protests.  The law, which easily passed both houses of Parliament last week, is the most overt sign, opponents say, that Mr. Modi intends to turn India into a Hindu-centric state that would leave the country’s 200 million Muslims at a calculated disadvantage.  Indian Muslims, who have watched anxiously as Mr. Modi’s government has pursued a Hindu nationalist program, have finally erupted in anger. Over the past few days, protests have broken in cities across the country.  Mumbai. Chennai. Varanasi. Guwahati. Hyderabad. Bhopal. Patna. Pondicherry. The disturbances keep spreading, and on Monday they tied up several areas of the capital, New Delhi.  [Update: Violence continues in New Delhi, and the police are criticized.] Mr. Modi’s government has responded by calling out troops, shutting down the internet and imposing curfews, just as it did when it clamped down on Kashmir. In New Delhi, police officers beat unarmed students with wooden poles, dragging them away and sending scores to the hospital. In Assam, they shot and killed several young men.  India’s Muslims had stayed relatively quiet during the other recent setbacks, keenly aware of the electoral logic that has pushed them to the margins. India is about 80 percent Hindu, and 14 percent Muslim, and Mr. Modi and his party won a crushing election victory in May and handily control the Parliament.  But Indian Muslims are feeling increasingly desperate, and so are progressives, many Indians of other faiths, and those who see a secular government as fundamental to India’s identity and its future.  The world is now weighing in, too. United Nations officials, American representatives, international advocacy groups and religious organizations have issued scathing statements saying that the citizenship law is blatantly discriminatory. Some are even calling for sanctions. Critics are deeply worried that Mr. Modi is trying to wrench India away from its secular, democratic roots and turn this nation of 1.3 billion people into a religious state, a homeland for Hindus.  “They want a theocratic state,’’ said B.N. Srikrishna, a former judge on India’s Supreme Court. “This is pushing the country to the brink, to the brink of chaos.” “This is how waves of communal violence start in the country,” he added. Mr. Modi is no stranger to communal violence. The worst bloodshed that India has seen in recent years exploded on his watch, in 2002, in Gujarat, when he was the top official in the state and clashes between Hindus and Muslims killed more than 1,000 people — most of them Muslims.  Mr. Modi was widely blamed for not doing enough to stop it. Courts have cleared him, but many people believe he was at least partly responsible for the brutality that unfolded.  His grip on power is still firm, even with a weakening economy. The political opposition, including the once-dominant Indian National Congress party, has been disorganized and shaky compared with the juggernaut he and his right-hand man, Amit Shah, the home minister, have built in their Bharatiya Janata Party.  But this contentious citizenship law, which paves a special path for non-Muslim migrants in India to become citizens, has galvanized the opposition. Rival opposition leaders who usually can’t agree on anything are planning protests together. Students from across the country are rallying to each other’s defense. Each episode of harsh police action captured by mobile phone and beamed around cyberspace catalyzes more sympathy, more protests — and more prospects for violence.  On Monday, Mr. Modi called for calm, saying on Twitter that the law “does not affect any citizen of India of any religion” and “the need of the hour is for all of us to work together.’’ This citizenship law was a much touted campaign promise and a special wish of his Hindu base. His supporters see a future India as a place that emphasizes its Hindu heritage as much as possible and eliminates the special legal protections that exist for Muslims and other minorities.  Some analysts are quick to point out that the course Mr. Modi’s party is charting could lead to an India dominated by one faith and one viewpoint, where existential tensions hold back the economy and hamstring politics — as embodied by Pakistan, India’s struggling, Islamic archenemy next door. ""We’re chasing a failed dream,’\' said Yogendra Yadav, a political commentator. The new citizenship legislation, called the Citizenship Amendment Act, expedites Indian citizenship for migrants from some of India’s neighboring countries if they are Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsee or Jain. Only one major religion in South Asia was left off: Islam.  Indian officials have denied any anti-Muslim bias and said the measure was intended purely to help persecuted minorities migrating from India’s predominantly Muslim neighbors — Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The legislation follows hand in hand with a divisive citizenship test conducted this summer in one state in northern India and possibly soon to be expanded nationwide. All residents of Assam, along the Bangladesh border, had to produce documentary proof that they or their ancestors lived in India since 1971. Around two million of Assam’s population of 33 million — a mix of Hindus and Muslims — failed to pass the test and now risk being rendered stateless. Huge new prisons are being built to house anyone determined to be an illegal immigrant. A widespread belief is that the Indian government will use both these measures — the citizenship tests and the new citizenship law — to strip away rights from Muslims who have been living in India for generations. The way this will happen, many Muslim Indians fear, is that they will be asked to produce old birth certificates or property deeds necessary to prove citizenship and they will be unable to do so. And while Hindu residents in the same situation will be given a pass, it seems, Muslim residents will not have the same legal protections. The protests started last week in Assam, led by Hindus and joined by Assamese Muslims and Christians. Many Hindus in Assam don’t like the new law either: They fear it could open the floodgates to poor migrants who will settle in Assam and take their land. And so, despite the legislation’s potential to drive a sectarian wedge across India, in Assam it backfired, unifying protesters across religious lines. Witnesses said that security forces fired live ammunition into a crowd, killing a 17-year-old Christian student as he walked home. Outraged demonstrators then burned down train stations and attacked the police. Struggling to maintain control, the central government sent in the army and shut down the internet. The angry crowds only grew. On Sunday, the protests spread to Delhi. Students of Jamia Millia Islamia University, a predominantly Muslim institution, gathered peacefully, witnesses said. But chaos broke out after a separate group of violent protesters joined the fray and began clashing with the police, witnesses said.  The police response was swift and indiscriminate, according to witnesses, and videos widely circulated on social media showed officers beating students. In one video, a group of female students tries to rescue a young man from the grasp of the police. A squad of officers in riot gear tears him away and knocks him down with heavy blows. Even after the women form a protective circle around him, officers can be seen jabbing the young man with their wooden poles.  Observers said that while police brutality was common in poorer, more rural areas of India, it was extremely unusual to see it explode on such a scale in the capital. Waqar Azam, a 26-year-old student, was studying in the university library when students burst in and yelled that the police were coming. The students locked the doors. Moments later, tear gas canisters crashed through the windows, filling the library with choking smoke. “What is happening to Indian Muslims today did not happen overnight,” Mr. Azam said. “If we don’t protest against it now, we will end up living like slaves.” Mr. Modi’s supporters have dismissed the protesters as being exclusively Muslim, or from a die-hard political opposition group. But in Assam, many protesters said they had voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party and now regretted it.  On Monday morning, some 5,000 protesters, of many faiths, gathered in central Guwahati, Assam’s capital. One chant echoed across town: “Down with Modi!” Reporting was contributed by Suhasini Raj from Guwahati, India, by Vindu Goel from Mumbai and by Hari Kumar, Shalini Venugopal, Sameer Yasir and Karan Deep Singh from New Delhi. ']",Several people have been killed as unrest spreads to new corners of the country. Many see the passage of a new law as anti-Muslim.
France Pension Protests: Why Unions Are Up in Arms Against Macron,2019-12-17,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — Strikes have disrupted France over the past few weeks, as labor unions angry over President Emmanuel Macron’s planned pension overhauls have ground trains to a halt, kept some schools closed, and taken to the streets to pressure the government.  The protests represent the biggest domestic showdown for Mr. Macron since the Yellow Vest movement last year, and they are testing his reformist zeal as he tries to overhaul a complex but generous pensions system.  The strikes have affected transportation more than any other sector, and have been especially acute in Paris, putting frustrated travelers and weary commuters in the middle of the dispute.  As pressure mounts on the government to end the crisis, here’s what you need to know about the debate.  Everyone expects a state-guaranteed pension, but details vary.  The French pension system has a redistributive, pay-as-you-go structure that functions like group insurance.  Workers and employers pay mandatory payroll taxes, known as social contributions, which are used to fund the pensions of retirees. Workers can also build up their own savings, but that does not constitute the backbone of the system, and private plans like 401(k)’s are uncommon.  Full benefits are earned after 41 years to 43 years of contributions, depending on when workers were born, but they can retire earlier than the legal age of 62 without full benefits.  Those are the general principles, at least: In practice, the system is complicated by 42 different pension programs. Some plans are managed jointly by labor and employer unions, some directly by the French state, and others still by a mix. Some cover tiny segments of the population — employees of the Paris Opera, for instance — while others are vast: The biggest program, for salaried workers in the private sector, covers 80 percent of French retirees; the state is involved because it manages mandatory payroll contributions.  Some are tied to a company (like the national railway company), to a status (like civil servants) or to a profession (like lawyers). Because of demographic trends specific to each plan, some are running surpluses, while others are in deficit.  A worker who changes jobs might jump from plan to plan, paying into one and then into the other, meaning retirees often have multiple pensions.  And rules vary too. Some programs let workers retire early with a full pension, and not all plans calculate pensions the same way. In the private sector, for instance, plans are based on a worker’s 25 highest-earning years; in the public sector they’re based on the last six months, when workers are likely to be at the height of their earning power.  Mostly, but some support simplifying it — as long as pensions don’t take a hit.  The pension system, like universal health care, is part of the generous welfare state that was created after World War II, and many in France are very attached to what they see as a hard-fought guarantee of high living standards for seniors.  In 2018, France had one of the highest income replacement ratios among European Union countries, at nearly 70 percent — excluding other social benefits — and one of the lowest rates of people 65 and older at risk of poverty, around 8 percent, according to Eurostat.  The O.E.C.D. said in a report released this year that  life expectancy after exiting the labor market was “5 years larger than in the O.E.C.D. on average.” Philippe Martinez, the head of the C.G.T., one of the largest unions opposed to Mr. Macron’s plans, said France had “the best retirement system in the world” — a feeling shared by many. But it comes at a cost. France spends roughly 14 percent of its gross domestic product on pensions, more than almost any European country.  The system’s dizzying complexity and alphabet soup of acronyms also make it difficult to understand what one is entitled to. Workers who arguably do the same job, like bus drivers in Paris and in Bordeaux, sometimes get different pensions. “The current system provides effective social protection for current retirees, but it is overly complex,” the O.E.C.D. report said. “Differences across schemes fuel the suspicion that workers covered by other schemes might be better treated.” The government wants a unified, point-based system; but it also wants the French to work longer.  Mr. Macron does not want to change the legal retirement age or the system’s redistributive nature. Instead, he wants to unify the 42 different programs into a single system that uses points, which workers would accumulate and cash in upon retirement.  That will make the system clearer, fairer and better adapted to the modern labor market, Mr. Macron argues, because workers would be able to switch jobs without jumping between retirement programs and would receive points even for short periods of work that currently do not count toward pensions.  But Mr. Macron also wants to put the system on firmer financial footing. In 2018, it was facing a deficit of 2.9 billion euros, or about $3.2 billion, a figure that is projected to balloon to between €7.9 billion and €17.2 billion by 2025 if no action is taken.  There is no imminent threat of collapse, and Mr. Macron’s critics — and even some of his allies — say he should put budgetary concerns on the back burner to focus on setting up the universal system. But the government says it would be “irresponsible” to overhaul the system without getting its finances in order.  Mr. Macron wants to define a new age — separate from the legal age of retirement — that workers would have to reach to receive a full pension, with incentives and penalties encouraging people to work until then, if not longer. The government wants to set that limit, called the “pivot age” or “age of equilibrium,” at 64.  Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said last week that “we must, to preserve our pensions system, work a bit longer,” mainly because of increasing life expectancies. “Do you think for one second that the French would believe me if I said: ‘Here are some new rights that are going to cost money, and I’m not going to tell you how to pay for them,’” Mr. Philippe told TF1, referring to promised measures like a guaranteed minimum pension of €1,000.  “To get their trust, one must say everything: the positives, and also the news that is a bit less popular,” he said.  Labor unions oppose Mr. Macron’s proposals, but for various reasons.  The strikers are angry at the prospect of losing benefits currently afforded to them by their various retirement schemes, and they are worried that their pensions will decrease significantly. Railway workers, for example, do not want to lose the ability to retire early. Teachers, who generally have low incomes, are afraid of losing out if pensions are calculated over their entire career instead of the final six months.  Some unions have vowed to strike through Christmas and beyond if the changes are not scrapped.  In a speech last week, Mr. Philippe, the prime minister, offered a few concessions, like delaying the changes and vowing that many older workers would not be affected.  He also tried to reassure protesters, for instance by promising raises for teachers, insisting that the new system would take difficult working conditions into account, and vowing that the law would prevent the value of accumulated points from decreasing.  But Mr. Philippe failed to mollify the unions opposed to the proposals — and he angered more moderate ones that had been cautiously supportive of the overhaul.  For instance, the C.F.D.T., one of France’s largest labor unions, supports a universal, point-based system but strongly opposes a “pivot age,” which it calls a thinly veiled effort to increase the effective age of retirement that would harm those who started working early.  A lack of clarity — over the value of a point, for example — has also left some French people feeling that they are going to lose out, and the strikers insist that they are defending everyone’s pensions, not just their own. Polls show a majority of support for the strikers, and while they show widespread support for a unified system, many do not trust Mr. Macron to implement it.  The government is expected to put legislation up for discussion in Parliament in February, and it hopes to get a vote by the summer.  But there is no end in sight for the strikes. ']",The country has been gripped by strikes over President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul a generous but dizzyingly complex pension system.
India Adopts the Tactic of Authoritarians: Shutting Down the Internet,2019-12-17,"By Jeffrey Gettleman, Vindu Goel and Maria Abi-Habib","['NEW DELHI — As the government of India pushes increasingly provocative policies, it is using a tactic to stifle dissent that is more commonly associated with authoritarian regimes, not democracies: It is shutting down the internet. India tops the world — by far — in the number of internet shutdowns imposed by local, state and national governments. Last year, internet service was cut in India 134 times, and so far this year, 93 shutdowns have occurred, according to SFLC.in, which relies on reports from journalists, advocacy groups and citizens.  The country’s closest competitor is Pakistan, which had 12 shutdowns last year. Syria and Turkey — countries not especially known for their democratic spirit — each shut down the internet just once in 2018.  “Any time there is a sign of disturbance, that is the first tool in the toolbox,” said Mishi Choudhary, founder of SFLC.in, a legal advocacy group in New Delhi that has tracked India’s internet shutdowns since 2012. “When maintenance of law and order is your priority, you are not thinking about free speech.” Last week, citing a threat of violence and false rumors, authorities in the states of Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura in northeast India severed connectivity in response to protests against a new citizenship law that critics say would marginalize India’s 200 million Muslims. Much of West Bengal and parts of Uttar Pradesh, two of India’s most populous states, were also put under digital lockdown.  With the Kashmir region still languishing offline since August, at least 60 million people have been cut off — roughly the population of France. These moves come as  Prime Minister Narendra Modi tightens his grip on India. His administration and its allies have jailed hundreds of Kashmiris without charges, intimidated journalists, arrested intellectuals and suppressed gloomy economic reports. His critics say he is undermining India’s deeply rooted traditions of democracy and secularism, and steadily stamping out dissent. [Read: As Modi pushes a Hindu nationalist agenda, a secular India is fighting back.] With half a billion Indians online, the authorities say they are simply trying to stop the spread of hateful and dangerous misinformation, which can move faster on Facebook, WhatsApp and other services than their ability to control it. “A lot of hate and provocative stuff starts appearing on messaging services, particularly WhatsApp,” said Harmeet Singh, a senior police official in Assam, which borders Bangladesh and has been one of the hot spots of protests against the citizenship law.  But as the internet becomes more integral to all aspects of life, the shutdowns affect far more than protesters or those involved in politics. The shutdowns can be devastating to people just trying to make a living.  In Kashmir, internet service was stopped on Aug. 5, when Mr. Modi’s government suddenly revoked the area’s autonomy, sent in thousands of troops, and disabled all communication, stifling public dissent. The internet has now been off 135 days. Some people even take a short flight to the next state just to check their email. “There is no work,’’ said Sheikh Ashiq Ahmad, the president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce. He said thousands of entrepreneurs, especially those who make silk scarves and handicrafts, relied on social media to sell their products online.  “The dignity of these people has been taken away,’’ he said. While many of India’s shutdowns have been intended to prevent the loss of life, some occurred for more mundane reasons, like to make it harder for students to cheat on exams. The legality of India’s internet shutdowns has not been tested in court. All shutdowns are supposed to be authorized by top state or national officials. In practice, most are ordered by local authorities, sometimes with just a few phone calls to local service providers.  The effectiveness of these shutdowns isn’t clear. Research by Jan Rydzak, a scholar at Stanford University, suggests that the information vacuum caused by an internet shutdown can actually encourage violent responses. On Tuesday, fresh protests broke out across the country once again over the citizenship law. In Kolkata, protesters blocked highways, and in New Delhi, police officers clashed with demonstrators, firing tear gas and tugging away participants by the collar of their jackets.  In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, opposition politicians led rowdy rallies against the new citizenship law, Citizenship Amendment Act, which favors non-Muslim immigrants seeking citizenship in India.  Many people are also upset about the National Register of Citizens, a citizenship review process that has already left nearly two million people in Assam potentially stateless. Amit Shah, India’s home minister and Mr. Modi’s right-hand man, has vowed to take the citizenship reviews nationwide. Many Indians, especially members of the Muslim minority, believe that with the new measures, the Modi government is plotting to strip away rights from Muslims.  They fear that the government could force citizenship reviews on all Indians and that Hindus without proper papers would be allowed to stay in India while Muslims without proper papers would be asked to leave.  Mr. Modi and his allies deny this, saying they are simply trying to address illegal migration and help persecuted minorities at the same time.  Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have roots deep in a Hindu-centric worldview that believes India, which is 80 percent Hindu, should be a Hindu homeland. Some of their biggest moves, including the crackdown on Kashmir, which was India’s only Muslim-majority state, have been widely seen as intentionally anti-Muslim. In West Bengal, which is about 27 percent Muslim, violent protests around these policies erupted on Friday. Protesters ransacked more than a dozen train stations. By Sunday, the authorities shut down the internet for more than one-fourth of the state’s 90 million people. Sujauddin Shekh, a college teacher in Murshidabad, said the shutdowns have left many people unable to know what’s going on.  “People in this region are largely dependent on Facebook and WhatsApp for the news,” he said.  There is no doubt that a lot of potentially dangerous information flows freely through India’s cyberspace, especially during crises. Take the example of the five women filmed rescuing a friend from being beaten up by police during a protest. Overnight, they became heroes —\xa0and targets.  On Sunday, videos went viral showing the five young women, students at a predominantly Muslim university in New Delhi, forming a protective circle around a young man as police officers beat him with wooden poles.  Several officials in Mr. Modi’s party tried to sully  their reputations; one wrote a  tweet calling them “rabidly indoctrinated Islamists.”  There is no evidence of that and in fact, one of the girls, 20-year-old Chanda Yadav, is a Hindu.  Ms. Yadav said the campaign to discredit her has been almost too much to bear. Still, she wants to speak out. “This fight is about India as a secular nation, an India where we all belong,” she said. But in places where the internet has been cut off, it’s harder to freely debate these questions. On Dec. 11, the authorities in Assam shut down everything but a government-run landline internet service, which was necessary to keep banks, universities and other institutions online. On Tuesday, they restored most landline internet service, but mobile internet, which is how most Indians stay connected, remained off. “Peace is more important than a little inconvenience to you and me,” said Mr. Singh, the Assam police official. Jeffrey Gettleman and Maria Abi Habib reported from New Delhi, and Vindu Goel from Mumbai. Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed reporting from Kolkata, Sameer Yasir from New Delhi and Suhasini Raj from Guwahati.']","India, the world’s largest democracy, shuts down the internet far more than any other country.

Australia Records Its Hottest Day. At Least for Now.,2019-12-18,By Jamie Tarabay,"['It is so hot, birds are abandoning the sky.  Hours after Australia set a record for its warmest day across the continent, with even hotter temperatures in the near forecast, Greg Marshall, a garden designer in Adelaide, said he had found birds of different species gathered on the ground Wednesday, under the shade of trees.  It was 106 degrees. “I’ve been walking around the parklands, turning on the taps at the bottom of the trees,” he said. The birds — “with their beaks open, all gasping for air,” he said — huddled around the faucets, trying to get a drink. A national heat wave, triggered by a confluence of meteorological factors that extends well beyond Australia’s shores, pushed high temperatures across the country on Tuesday to an average of 105.6 degrees, or 40.9 degrees Celsius, breaking the record of 104.5, or 40.3 Celsius, set on Jan. 7, 2013. On Thursday, said Dean Narramore of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the heat will spread even farther across the central and southern parts of the country, like an inkblot blooming and growing on a page. As the temperatures have risen, so has the threat of fires, which have ravaged large swathes of the country and shrouded Sydney in smoke.  Late monsoons in India, an imbalance in sea temperatures in the Indian Ocean and strong winds have hampered rainfall in Australia. The country was already in the grip of a yearslong drought. “Friday looks like it will be a very bad day,” Mr. Narramore said, adding that lightning strikes in bush land could start even more fires. For weeks, Australians on the eastern coast have been living under a total fire ban as bush fires have raged unabated, burning through houses, killing wildlife and making the air dangerous to breathe. The Air Quality Index, which measures pollution, has exceeded 400 in some parts of Sydney. Readings of 100 and above are considered “poor.” “All of this is connected,” Mr. Narramore said. “A record-late monsoon in India means the rain will be late coming to Australia, it’s the worst fire season we’ve seen across Australia, it’s warming through climate change, and it’s only the third week of summer.” Forecasters have said that the heat wave could bring temperatures never before seen in Australia.  The highest temperature ever recorded in the country was 123 degrees on Jan. 2, 1960, in Oodnadatta, a remote outback town in South Australia. On Wednesday, the hottest place on the continent was Birdsville, Queensland, which reached 117 degrees. Nine of Australia’s 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, with last year the third hottest. As the country bakes and burns, the government has come under criticism for refusing to actively address climate change through sharper emissions cuts.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison generated disapproving headlines on Wednesday after it was reported that he had left Australia for a Hawaii vacation as the authorities raised emergency warnings across the country, fires continued to burn and Australians sweltered. In Perth, a man drew wide attention on social media after roasting pork inside his old Datsun car, whose interior he said reached 178 degrees.  In Adelaide, people were still outside working, delivering parcels and laboring on building sites, Mr. Marshall said. He normally tours one or two of his gardens during a workday, largely for maintenance. On Wednesday, he visited 12. “Some of the larger ones are really suffering,” he said. “Right now, we’re waiting for the fire. It’s a tinderbox, and everything’s aligning for Friday. It’s pretty bad.”   ']",A national heat wave pushed high temperatures across the country on Tuesday to an average of 105.6 degrees. Even more heat is in the forecast. 
"Lebanon, Mired in Crises, Turns to a Professor as Prime Minister",2019-12-19,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon’s president appointed a little-known professor and former education minister to form a new government as prime minister on Thursday in the midst of street protests and a financial crisis that have left the country reeling. The appointee, Hassan Diab, vowed to swiftly form a new government to “focus on stopping the collapse and restoring confidence.” But he faces an uphill battle on multiple fronts. Since October, protesters across the country have taken over city squares and blocked main roads in anger over years of corruption and poor governance. That has exacerbated a long-building financial crisis in Lebanon, one of the world’s most indebted countries. Lebanon has been overseen by a caretaker government since Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in the face of mass protests on Oct. 29. It appeared unlikely that the appointment of Mr. Diab, a 60-year-old professor at the American University of Beirut, would quell the protests, and it was unclear whether he could take swift steps to slow the country’s collapse. After other candidates failed to get the necessary parliamentary support, President Michel Aoun named Mr. Diab to form a government on Thursday after he won the support of 69 members of the country’s 128-member Parliament — a simple majority. In Lebanon’s sect-based political system, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, and Mr. Diab’s appointment was unique in that his backing came not from fellow Sunnis but from Christian and Shiite parties. The latter includes Hezbollah, the militant group that the United States and other countries have designated a terrorist organization. That could hamper Mr. Diab’s ability to form a representative cabinet. It could also complicate a new government’s efforts to unlock international assistance, if Mr. Diab is even able to build one. Western countries such as France and the United States, which have supported Lebanon in the past, have hesitated to give aid this time, saying it would be conditioned on political reforms. Some analysts doubted that Mr. Diab’s appointment would be enough to address the country’s simultaneous crises, questioning the qualifications he brought to the difficult job. “You need someone with integrity and vision, someone who understands that Lebanon is at a key juncture both politically and financially — and how are you going to deal with that?” said Sami Atallah, the director of the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies. “You need a skilled team to work on all these issues, and I don’t get a sense that he will be the person who will pull it off.” Late Thursday, protesters gathered at Martyrs’ Square in downtown Beirut to oppose Mr. Diab’s nomination. The protest movement has remained largely leaderless while presenting demands that range from the formation of a government of experts to the ouster of the country’s entire political elite. “Lebanon is passing through a harsh, difficult economic crisis, and Diab doesn’t have the magic wand to solve it,” said Ihab Hassan, a protester. “The new prime minister is going to form the same government based on sharing among sects, and this is what we’ve been demonstrating against for weeks.”']","Hassan Diab, chosen by the president to form a new government, vowed to work swiftly to slow the country’s collapse."
"Queen’s Speech Promises Brexit Soon, and Ambitious Domestic Agenda",2019-12-19,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — The last time Queen Elizabeth II presided over the opening of the British Parliament, only 66 days ago, she arrived in a gilded, horse-drawn carriage and wore an 18-foot velvet cape — a regal symbol of continuity at a time when her country was being convulsed by the debate over Brexit. On Thursday, the queen was back to open Parliament again, arriving by car and clad in a simple teal coat — a no-nonsense approach for a nation that, in the wake of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s sweeping election victory last week, wants desperately to put Brexit behind it and get back to a semblance of normalcy. The queen laid out an ambitious agenda for Mr. Johnson’s government that will include major investments in the National Health Service and law enforcement, ending the austerity policies that characterized nearly a decade of Conservative government. She also confirmed that, as Mr. Johnson promised, Britain will be out of the European Union by Jan. 31. “My ministers will seek a future relationship with the European Union based on a free-trade agreement that benefits the whole of the United Kingdom,” the queen said, delivering the government’s upbeat, likely unrealistic, goal of hammering out a comprehensive deal by the end of next year. But outside the swelling chorus of optimism in the House of Lords, where the queen spoke, there were a few discordant notes.  Just before the queen spoke, one part of her kingdom renewed its quest to break away: The Scottish National Party formally demanded that Scotland be allowed to hold another referendum on independence. Mr. Johnson will almost certainly rebuff the Scots, but since the nationalists rolled back the Conservative Party in Scotland, they are sure to remain a thorn in his side. And retail sales fell for a fourth consecutive month in November, deepening the main street gloom and underscoring the economic threat still posed by the split with the European Union. Still, compared to the last queen’s speech, which was almost lost in the din over Brexit, this ceremony was relatively tranquil. In October, Mr. Johnson’s party had no majority and was essentially powerless to pass any contentious legislation. Britain’s Supreme Court had rebuked him for illegally suspending Parliament amid a bitter debate over his Brexit policy. The queen’s speech amounted to a political pitch by Mr. Johnson to the voters before a general election, fueling criticism that he was exploiting the monarch. This time, the political context could hardly be more different. With Mr. Johnson commanding a hefty majority, his plan to leave the European Union will sail through. He is now shifting attention to what he calls the “people’s priorities” — spending on health care, education and law and order. The queen’s speech was designed to start delivering on his campaign promises. Among them is a pledge to channel more money into the increasingly beleaguered National Health Service. The government enshrined in law Mr. Johnson’s election promise to increase funding of the health service by 33.9 billion pounds, or about $43 billion, by the fiscal year covering 2023 and 2024. The government said it would set up a Royal Commission to review the criminal justice system and pass new espionage legislation to help law enforcement agencies cope with hostile state actors and domestic threats. It also promised a tougher stand on crime, increasing sentences for violent and sexual offenders and requiring those convicted of the worst offenses, including terrorism, to serve more of their sentences. During the final days of the campaign, Britain was rattled by a stabbing attack near London Bridge that killed two people, as well as the assailant, an Islamic extremist who had been released from prison. The police classified it as an act of terrorism, and it prompted a debate over sentencing for extremists. Mr. Johnson is taking aim at the court that ruled against him for suspending Parliament. He plans to review the powers of the nation’s top judges through a new Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission. And having bridled under an act of Parliament that makes it hard for prime ministers to call a general election at a time of their choosing, he is now moving to scrap it. “This is not a program for one year or one Parliament,” Mr. Johnson declared in the House of Commons “It is a blueprint for the future of Britain.” Jeremy Corbyn, the vanquished leader of the Labour Party, claimed in Parliament on Thursday that the prime minister had appropriated much of his social agenda from the opposition, and mocked him for having to pass a law to force his own government to invest in the National Health Service. But when Mr. Corbyn took credit for shifting the debate, he was met with hoots of derision from the Conservative backbenches. For all of Mr. Johnson’s efforts to turn the page on Brexit, it still hangs over the country — and is likely to continue to do so. His government will propose bills on agriculture, fisheries and trade — areas where Britain will assume powers now exercised by the European Union. There will be laws to create a new immigration system, which could be in place at the end of 2020 and would remove the special status that citizens of other European Union countries currently have in Britain. Mr. Johnson will enshrine in law his pledge to finish negotiations on a trade deal by the end of 2020, ruling out any extension of the transition period. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described that timetable as “extremely challenging.” Analysts say it raised the prospect of a so-called “no-deal Brexit,” which they said would be economically disastrous. In Britain’s topsy-turvy year, when conventions were shattered and norms discarded, the ceremony on Thursday was a return to the reassuring rituals. Members of the House of Commons were summoned to the House of Lords by the Lady Usher of the Black Rod, who banged her staff on the door after the lawmakers had, by custom, slammed it in her face. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Corbyn walked together between the chambers, the prime minister making a cheerful effort to engage his defeated rival while the Labour leader studiously ignored him. But the queen, having gone through the entire exercise two months earlier, was not keen to repeat every part of it. Since October, she has had her own turmoil to deal with: the suspension of her second son, Prince Andrew, from his public duties after a storm of outrage over an interview he gave to the BBC about his relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. She will next address the British people on Christmas Day.']","To deliver what British prime minister Boris Johnson calls the “people’s priorities,” sharp spending increases are promised for health care and the police.

Son of Spies Whose Case Inspired ‘The Americans’ Can Become Canadian,2019-12-19,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — It has all the makings of a Cold War drama: Russian sleeper spies posing as a suburban family in North America, children who say they were oblivious their parents were Russian agents and an elaborate F.B.I. operation unmasking the shadowy ruse. On Thursday, Canada’s Supreme Court ruled that the younger son of real-life Russian spies who helped inspire the television series “The Americans” is entitled to Canadian citizenship, after a protracted legal battle in which he argued that children should not be punished for the sins of their parents. The case centers on Toronto-born Alexander Vavilov, now 25, who returned to Russia with his brother, Timothy, after their parents — Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova — were unmasked as spies and arrested by F.B.I. agents in the United States in 2010. The arrests were part of the unraveling of a Russian espionage ring that had used high-tech gadgetry and detailed cover stories to collect political gossip and policy talk about the United States. Under Canadian law, people born in Canada have the right to Canadian citizenship with rare exceptions, including if they are children born to diplomatic officers or employees of a foreign government. The legal battle began in 2010, when Alexander Vavilov’s application to renew his Canadian passport was denied. His Canadian citizenship was later revoked by immigration authorities on the grounds that his parents were employees of Russia who had been in Canada for espionage. In 2016, after a Canadian lower court upheld the immigration officials’ decision, Mr. Vavilov won an appeal at a higher court. Then, the Canadian government appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, the highest legal authority. In its ruling on Thursday the Supreme Court said it was unreasonable to apply the exception to the right of citizenship by birth to Mr. Vavilov given that his parents were not consular or diplomatic officials who had enjoyed immunity or privileges under Canadian law. Mr. Vavilov “did not know that his parents were not who they claimed to be,” the court wrote. “He believed that he was a Canadian citizen by birth, he lived and identified as a Canadian, and he held a Canadian passport.” “The relief I feel is indescribable,” Mr. Vavilov said in a statement read by his lawyer. “I can finally take a deep breath and relax knowing that my citizenship is secure and no longer the subject of attacks and doubts. It is a recognition that not only do I feel Canadian but I am Canadian in eyes of the law.” Hadayt Nazami, Mr. Vavilov’s lawyer, said the brothers had the right to Canadian citizenship since they were innocent victims who were unaware their parents were working as spies. Moreover, he said their parents were not officially working for the Russian government when they were in Canada. “These are innocent people caught up in this bigger game between superpowers,” he said by phone. “At the time they were children. We do not use citizenship laws to try to punish people for something their parents have done.” The back story of the Vavilov family is the stuff of a spy thriller — which it helped inspire with “The Americans.”   After being trained in Russia, Mr. Vavilov’s parents moved to Toronto, where they took on the names of Canadians who had died as infants — Tracey Lee Ann Foley and Donald Howard Heathfield. The couple started a successful diaper business and had two boys — Timothy in 1990 and Alexander in 1994. After a period of living in France, the family moved to the United States in 1999, and eventually lived in Cambridge, Mass., where Mr. Bezrukov undertook graduate work at Harvard. But the couple were being monitored by the F.B.I. as part of a sprawling Russian spy ring that had rigorous training and undercover identities and included sleeper spies in Yonkers, N.Y., Manhattan, New Jersey, Boston and Virginia. The couple pleaded guilty to spying for Russia and returned to Russia as part of a swap with American spies arrested in Russia. In an affidavit submitted to one of the Canadian courts, Alexander Vavilov said he had grown up believing he was Canadian, had learned French and English in deference to his Canadian heritage, and had been shocked and “traumatized” to discover that his parents were spies. “I remember vividly the F.B.I. agents entering our house with weapons as I walked down the stairs,” he wrote.  “My parents were handcuffed in front of my eyes. Canada will always be my home,” he added. “It is the only culture I can associate with, and has been a cornerstone of my identity.”']",Canada’s highest court ruled that the son of the Russian spies whose story helped inspire a hit TV series is entitled to citizenship.
Corruption Case That Tarnished Trudeau Ends With SNC-Lavalin’s Guilty Plea,2019-12-18,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — The company whose corruption case nearly derailed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s campaign for re-election, bruising his image as a feminist and defender of “sunny ways,” pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a fraud charge of bribing Libyan officials. The construction division of SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based engineering firm, admitted to paying 127 million Canadian dollars in bribes to Libyan officials to secure contracts in that country. About a third of that money went to the son of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the dictator who ruled Libya at the time. The company was fined 280 million Canadian dollars, or about $213 million, to be paid out over five years.  The guilty plea resolves a case that upended Canadian politics this year, threatening Mr. Trudeau’s re-election hopes and tarnishing his reputation.  It began with accusations by Jody Wilson-Raybould, an Indigenous leader who was then the justice minister and attorney general, that Mr. Trudeau and his mostly male aides had ganged up on her to get her to settle the criminal case against the company with a civil penalty. The federal ethics commissioner ultimately ruled that Mr. Trudeau attempted “to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit” Ms. Wilson-Raybould by trying to sway her on how to handle the case.  Mr. Trudeau said a criminal conviction would imperil jobs in Quebec because it would have barred the company from bidding on government contracts.  But Wednesday’s settlement would not affect SNC-Lavalin’s ability to pursue government work because the plea involves only the construction division, the company said in a statement.  Mr. Trudeau’s office and the office of his new attorney general, David Lametti, declined to comment on the company’s assertion, as did prosecutors.  Charges against the parent company and its international unit, which were part of the original case filed in 2015, were withdrawn as part of the guilty plea, prosecutors said.  The case, along with revelations that Mr. Trudeau wore black and brownface as a student and teacher, badly battered Mr. Trudeau’s image. Since his election in 2015, he has positioned himself as a leader who took a new, open approach to politics. And he has trumpeted his credentials as feminist, who appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, and as a defender of Indigenous rights.  But after Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s accusations, his political opponents tried to change the narrative, saying he wasn’t really who he seemed to be.  It didn’t help that Ms. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet over the case, as did Jane Philpott, the treasury board president, who quit in solidarity. Mr. Trudeau has rejected the assertion that he acted improperly, and in August, after the ethics ruling was announced, said, “the way this happened shouldn’t have happened.” Mr. Trudeau won re-election in October, but without a voting majority for his Liberal Party in the House of Commons, which analysts attributed to the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin case. “This put this to bed as a political issue,” said Andrew McDougall, a political scientist at the University of Toronto. “I don’t think many Canadians will be surprised by this outcome.” The case against the company had remained in limbo since Ms. Wilson-Raybould stepped down. Apparently unwilling to offend voters in Quebec who were concerned about possible job losses, but also unwilling to be seen siding with the company, Mr. Trudeau left it in the hands of his new attorney general, Mr. Lametti. In a statement, Mr. Lametti said that the arrangement with the company was “made independently” by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada which, by tradition, generally operates without direction from political office holders. Its officials, like Ms. Wilson-Raybould, had opposed a civil settlement in the case. One former SNC-Lavalin executive, Sami Bebawi, was found guilty by a jury in Quebec last weekend, on five charges including fraud, corruption of foreign officials and money laundering. Evidence in the trial showed that Mr. Bebawi, 73, bribed government officials in Libya to obtain contracts and pocketed millions of dollars. SNC-Lavalin did not respond to questions about why it pushed for a civil settlement when it now appears that there was a way to accept a criminal charge without jeopardizing the company. Jennifer Quaid, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who has followed the case closely, said the company likely wanted to be treated like its British and American competitors have been in similar circumstances. She said it was not apparent how prosecutors determined the amount of the fine. There were also few publicly available details about what compliance changes, ethical or legal, the company must undertake during a three-year period of probation. “From the company’s perspective, they got what they wanted,” Professor Quaid said. “I’m not so sure about how it serves the public’s interest.”  ']","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada tried to “undermine” his attorney general in the case, according to a top ethics official."
There Are No Children Here. Just Lots of Life-Size Dolls.,2019-12-17,By Motoko Rich and Nadia Shira Cohen,"['NAGORO, Japan — The last children were born in the remote mountain village of Nagoro 18 years ago. Now, just over two dozen adults live in this outpost straddling a river on the Japanese island of Shikoku. The elementary school closed its doors in 2012, shortly after the last two students completed sixth grade. But on a recent bright autumn Sunday, Tsukimi Ayano brought the school back to life. It just so happened that she did it with dolls rather than humans. Ms. Ayano, 70, had arrayed more than 40 handmade dolls in a lifelike tableau on the grounds of the shuttered school. Recreating a school sports day known as “undokai,” a staple of the Japanese calendar, she had posed child-size dolls in a footrace, perched on a swing set and tossing balls. “We never see children here anymore,” said Ms. Ayano, who was born in Nagoro, and has staged an annual doll festival for the last seven years. “I wish there were more children because it would be more cheerful,” she said. “So I made the children.” Japan’s population is shrinking and aging, and nowhere is the trend felt more intensively than in its rural regions, where a low birthrate is exacerbated by dwindling employment opportunities and an inconvenient lifestyle.  “There are no chances for young people here,” said Ms. Ayano, who remembers when the village had a medical clinic, a pachinko gambling parlor and a diner. Now, Nagoro does not have even one shop. “They can’t make a living.” Some 350 dolls made by Ms. Ayano and her friends outnumber the human residents by more than 10 to 1. All around Nagoro, she has staged the dolls — made of wood and wire frames, stuffed with newspapers and dressed in old clothes donated from across Japan — in various scenes evoking the real people who once populated the village. An old woman tends a roadside grave, while another rests in a wheelchair. Construction workers smoke cigarettes on break while others wait at the bus stop. A father pulls a wagon full of children. A mischief maker shakes chestnuts from a tree. Inside the school, dolls loiter on the stairwells or sit at desks in front of teachers giving eternal lessons. Ms. Ayano has a playful touch, giving many of her dolls an impish mien. The overall effect, of a town dominated by dolls, is not as eerie as it might initially sound. “I don’t think it’s creepy,” said Fanny Raynaud, 38, a nurse from France who was traveling through Japan on a motorcycle with her husband, Chris Monnon, 55. They stopped in Nagoro after reading about the dolls on a travel blog.  “I think it is a beautiful way to make the village alive again,” Ms. Raynaud said. Another visitor scrawled a more pointed message on a chalkboard in one of the school’s classrooms: “Where are the living?” Nagoro, which sits in what is known as the Iya Valley surrounded by vast mountainsides blanketed by cedar trees, was never a big place. Even when Ms. Ayano was a child, the population was only about 300. Shikoku is by far the smallest and least populated of Japan’s four main islands.  During the 1950s and ’60s, the region was fueled by forestry, road construction and dam building for hydroelectric plants. Once the dams were built, many people left. Those who stayed operate their own pumps to bring water to grow their own vegetables. To get to a supermarket or the nearest hospital, Nagoro’s residents drive an hour and a half along narrow, winding roads. “You have to really like mountain living,” said Tatsuya Matsuura, who at 38 is the youngest resident of Nagoro. “I think a lot of people would have trouble living here.” Mr. Matsuura is the third generation of his family to operate a guesthouse for hikers on Mt. Tsurugi, about six miles up the road from Nagoro. Three years ago, as business dwindled to nothing, the family shut down a general store and inn in Nagoro.  “If we continue on the path we have taken for the last 10 or 20 years, rural areas will continue to shrink and people will continue to concentrate in the cities,” said Hiroya Masuda, a professor at the University of Tokyo and a former governor of Iwate, in northern Japan. “Many communities will eventually vanish.” Nagoro is one of several hamlets consolidated into a municipal area where more than 40 percent of the residents are 65 or older. Even with child care subsidies, discounted medical bills and housing support, the area has little luck attracting new residents or luring back adults who were born in the region. The local government merged several schools together and spent more than $8 million on a spacious new set of buildings. Just 38 students are enrolled in the entire school. Most students travel to bigger towns for high school, and leave the region altogether for college or work.  “We want them to choose the life they want,” said Hiromi Mukai, principal of Higashi-Iya Elementary and Middle School. “It is unavoidable.” Ms. Ayano, the eldest of four siblings, moved out of Nagoro at age 12 when her father took a job at a food company in Osaka, Japan’s third largest city. She met and married her husband and raised two children with him there. After retiring, her father returned to Nagoro to help take care of his ailing father-in-law and to nurse his wife through kidney failure. Sixteen years ago, Ms. Ayano returned to the village to look after her father, 90, and Nagoro’s oldest resident. In the field in front of their home, she planted a few radish and pea seeds. Birds dug them out, so she made a scarecrow, fashioning it in her father’s likeness. “It looked like a real human, not a conventional scarecrow,” Ms. Ayano said. “That is why it really worked.” She added three or four dolls in the shape of women weeding the field and others on the side of the road. When a few travelers passing through asked some of the dolls for directions, Ms. Ayano was so amused that she started making them full time. She now gives occasional doll-making lessons in a nearby town or to visitors to her studio, set up in the village’s old nursery school. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Ayano showed a group of women who had driven 60 miles from Tosa City how to create an angry or benevolent expression by angling fabric in different directions to make eyebrows. Extra stitching could denote cheekbones or the creases of age. Sometimes she takes custom orders from around Japan. A doctor whose wife died of cancer asked for two replicas of his spouse, one to keep in the living room and another for his bedroom. Ms. Ayano keeps a doll modeled after her grandmother in the passenger seat of her car. When driving the hour and a half to the grocery store, she said, “I’m never lonely.” The day before the recreated sports festival at the old school, Ms. Ayano staged various scenes with the help of a group of college volunteers, as well as a few other villagers and her sister and brother-in-law, who had come from Kyushu in southern Japan. Up until dark, Ms. Ayano meticulously stitched arms, hair and clothing into place. After an overnight rain, she was up before dawn, refreshing her work. By the time the festival opened, the sun emerged. Residents set up food stalls serving soba noodles, fried potatoes and octopus balls. Osamu Tsuzuki, 73, the owner of a local construction firm, gave a welcoming speech. “On behalf of staff, villagers and more than 300 dolls,” he said, “we have all been waiting for you.” A few children showed up from nearby towns or were visiting grandparents.  During a tug of war, people joined dolls whose hands Ms. Ayano had sewn to the rope. There were not enough human children, so competitors in their 80s gave it their all. After a footrace, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, 82, a resident of a nursing home down the mountain, stroked the cheek of a doll in one of the running lanes.  “She is so cute,” said Mr. Yamamoto, a retired road maintenance worker. “I wanted to talk to her.” Kayoko Motokawa, 67, grandmother of a toddler who resembled a doll himself, said it was sad that Nagoro was now known for dolls rather than its people.  “If these were real humans,” said Ms. Motokawa, taking in the festivities, “this would be a truly happy place.” Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']","As Japan’s population shrinks and ages, rural areas are emptying out.

"Cheese Smells. Deal With It, a German Court Rules.",2019-12-18,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — To Wolfgang Hofmann, the owner of a cheese store near Munich, the smell of his product was a sign of craft, taste and tradition.  But to Manuela Kragler, the woman who lived upstairs, it was an inescapable stink, rising through open windows and water pipes, wafting through the electrical outlets and permeating her home. Fed up with the situation, she took her lament to the street, drawing up signs with squiggly lines under a nose to draw attention to the odor. Their dispute, which simmered for more than three years, ended up before a judge after Mr. Hofmann, worried about the effect that the warning signs were having on his business, took his neighbor to court. On Tuesday, the judge decided that the smell was unavoidable and told Ms. Kragler to end her campaign. “That a shop where large quantities of cheese are stored produces smells is a statement of fact,” the court found.  The ruling said that while anyone was allowed to express an opinion on whether that smell is good or bad, posting cautionary signs on or around Mr. Hofmann’s store, as Ms. Kragler did, was not permitted, because it infringed on his ability to run his business. Germany is the European Union’s largest producer of cheese — making 2.2 million tons of it in 2017, more even than France or Italy — and specialty shops like Mr. Hofmann’s carry many different varieties. The website for Mr. Hofmann’s shop, in the village of Bad Heilbrunn, says that his philosophy is that “Cheese is a living food stuff, it changes in the course of its life, it ripens.” “For us,” the site adds, “it is very important to make consumers value and recognize the culture of cheese-making as part of our contribution to its continuation.” Ms. Kragler was not convinced. She told the German news agency DPA that she had tried in vain to broker a solution with Mr. Hofmann, and had then turned to the city authorities that had allowed him to move his business into a former grocery store on the ground floor of the building where she lives. But nothing changed, she told the news agency. So she took matters into her own hands. “I decided to communicate in a nonverbal way that it stinks for those of us who live in the building,” Ms. Kragler said. She posted the signs on the sidewalk outside Mr. Hofmann’s shop and stuck them to the windows. He would scrape them off, only to see them appear again. The court ruling said that while Ms. Kragler is allowed to “claim that she considers the smell to be stinky and a form of pollution,” she is not allowed to post warning signs.  The ruling is not final and can be challenged by either party. Mr. Hofmann has begun looking to move his shop, which was founded in 1972 in nearby Bad Tölz and features handmade cheeses that can spend months ripening.  But Ms. Kragler’s campaign might have ended up working against her: Mr. Hofmann told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that her signs had made it harder for him to find a new location.  “Now everyone thinks, ‘Oh, God, here comes the cheese shop. Everything is going to stink,’” he said.  ']",A fight over the food stuff ended up in court after a neighbor posted signs outside a cheese shop to complain about the stench.
Gandhi Biographer Arrested as Protests Over Citizenship Law Sweep India,2019-12-19,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI —\xa0Rowdy protests against a contentious new citizenship law swept India on Thursday, and the authorities responded by shutting down the internet, barricading roads and arresting hundreds of protesters, revealing an Indian government increasingly on edge. In Bangalore, Ramachandra Guha, a pre-eminent biographer of Mohandas K. Gandhi and a critic of the citizenship law, was midsentence in speaking to a reporter when helmeted police officers carrying sticks grabbed his arms and dragged him away. It was all captured on video. “Our protest is totally nonviolent,” Mr. Guha said, seconds before he was detained. “See what is happening. You see we are totally peaceful. Did you see any violence?”  Mr. Guha was then put into a bus full of other detainees. He was released later in the day.  The Indian news media reported that three people were killed during protests, two in Mangalore and one in Lucknow. In New Delhi, the capital, demonstrators flocked to the historic Red Fort, chanting, “We want freedom!” and “The person who will walk the path of Hitler will die the death of Hitler!” Anger, energy and opposition to the government are growing by the day. More and more Indians are pouring onto the streets of major cities, from Kolkata in the east to Kochi in the south, to express outrage at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government for pushing through a law that favors granting citizenship to South Asians of faiths other than Islam. The government has responded to this week’s protests with riot officers and internet shutdowns. India tops the world — by far — in the number of digital lockdowns it has imposed, outpacing authoritarian governments such as those of Syria and Turkey. [Read: As Modi pushes a Hindu nationalist agenda, a secular India is fighting back.] Police officials in Delhi said they had detained hundreds of people and converted a sports stadium into a temporary jail, though the Indian news media said that many of the at least 300 people arrested were later released.  India’s Muslims, a minority in this vast country but, at 200 million, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, have weathered an increasingly nasty campaign of abuse and discrimination on Mr. Modi’s watch.  Though Mr. Modi has denied any anti-Muslim bias, his political party is deeply rooted in a worldview that celebrates India as a homeland for Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of the country’s population.  Many members of his Bharatiya Janata Party, including high-ranking officials, have uttered discriminatory comments about Muslims and even celebrated thugs who have beaten up or killed them. Mob lynchings of Muslims have increased in recent years as Mr. Modi’s party has dominated politics. This week, the resentment in the country’s Muslim population finally erupted. Tens of thousands of Muslims and Indians of other faiths have demonstrated against the new Citizenship Amendment Act, a core piece of Mr. Modi’s agenda.  The act creates a special path for citizenship for migrants from some of India’s neighboring countries if they are Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsee or Jain — in short, followers of any major religion in South Asia, bar one: Islam.  Many Muslims and progressive Indians call the law a dangerous step toward marginalizing an already fearful community and a blatant violation of India’s long commitment to secularism and equality, which is enshrined in its Constitution.  And many fear that it may be just the beginning.  Amit Shah, the home minister and Mr. Modi’s right-hand man, has vowed to expand a contentious citizenship review process that has already left nearly two million people from one state in northeastern India potentially without a country.  Mr. Shah and other party officials have said the policy is not intended to discriminate against Indian Muslims. Rather, they say, it is needed to expel illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, India’s poorer, predominantly Muslim neighbor.  Many people believe that if the citizenship review goes nationwide, as Mr. Shah has repeatedly promised, it could strip many Indians of citizenship if they cannot produce the required documents, such as old birth certificates or real estate deeds.  Mr. Modi’s opponents say that the combination of the Citizenship Amendment Act, referred to as the C.A.A., and the citizenship review process — called the National Register of Citizens, or N.R.C. — could take away Muslims’ rights while allowing Hindus and followers of other faiths to stay in the country, with all legal protections. In the past 10 days, several people have been killed or badly injured in protests against the government. Dozens of university students in New Delhi were beaten by police officers wielding wooden poles. Hundreds of people have been detained, including Yogendra Yadav, a well-known political commentator, Umar Khalid, a social activist, and several opposition politicians. The authorities in New Delhi shut down the internet in several areas on Thursday, something that longtime residents of the capital said they could not remember happening before. Local officials shut down service to more than a dozen subway stations, and several school closings were announced for Friday.  On Thursday, Indian officials issued a statement that tried to defang the rising criticism of the citizenship measures. “No Indian citizen of any religion needs to worry at all either about C.A.A. or N.R.C.,” it said.  But the statement also made a national citizenship review sound like a fait accompli. “When N.R.C. comes, will I have to provide details of birth of parents etc. to prove my Indian citizenship?” read the statement, which was in question-and-answer format.  “Details of your birth like date/month and year and place of birth are enough,” the answer read. “If not available, you may have to provide such details of birth of parents.” Hari Kumar, Sameer Yasir and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.']","The scholar, Ramachandra Guha, was among hundreds detained on Thursday, as opposition to the new citizenship law continued to roil Indian cities.

"Chinese Students Denounce Limits on Free Speech, in a Rare Protest",2019-12-18,By Javier C. Hernández and Albee Zhang,"['BEIJING — Students at a prominent Chinese university on Wednesday staged protests against efforts by the ruling Communist Party to further extend its control over university campuses, a rare and risky rebuke that highlighted broader concerns about the erosion of free speech under President Xi Jinping. The protests were a response to the decision this month by Fudan University, a Shanghai institution known for its relatively tolerant culture, to rewrite its charter to emphasize loyalty to the party over traditional values like independence and academic freedom.  Fudan was one of three universities to make the changes, which were widely publicized on Chinese social media sites this week, prompting a backlash that extended beyond university campuses. Many people criticized the universities for appearing to back away from principles they said were necessary for China to have a competitive education system. As criticism mounted, the authorities moved swiftly to limit the discussion, censoring comments and a hashtag about the issue. The changes to the charters revived concerns that Mr. Xi, who has led a broad crackdown on free speech since rising to power in 2012, is intensifying efforts to turn universities into party strongholds and silence dissent. “We want to show that we cannot tolerate this,” said a Fudan undergraduate who was among dozens of students protesting on Wednesday against the school’s decision to remove a reference to “freedom of thought” from its charter. The undergraduate asked to be identified only by a surname, Qiu, for fear of being punished. While universities have never had total autonomy since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949,  the government has in recent decades granted them limited freedom to debate ideas, such as constitutional law, that might otherwise be shunned in official circles. Under Mr. Xi, the space for free inquiry has rapidly narrowed. Schools have fired dissident teachers, recruited students to act as classroom informers and banned some Western textbooks. The government has also ordered schools to start research centers devoted to Mr. Xi’s signature ideology, known as “Xi Jinping Thought.”  The Communist Party has long kept a close watch on universities, especially in the aftermath of pro-democracy protests near Tiananmen Square three decades ago, which involved large numbers of students.  Now, with young people playing a pivotal role in the monthslong antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, including recent violent clashes with the police on university campuses in the semiautonomous territory, concerns about the ideological purity of students have resurfaced at the highest levels of the party.  Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said the Hong Kong protests had underscored for the party that it should not “leave blind spots on campus.” He said that other mainland universities were likely to adopt similar statements of support to send the message that the party is “the absolute leader” of schools. The protests on Wednesday were relatively small in size, but were risky in a country where criticism of the party and its policies can be met with serious punishment. The authorities have in recent years detained or harassed students for organizing political protests and punished professors who speak critically of the party.  The student protesters on Wednesday avoided directly attacking the party, and the authorities did not immediately intervene.  At Fudan, students gathered in a cafeteria and joined in a rendition of Fudan’s official anthem, which includes the “freedom of thought” phrase that was deleted from the school’s charter. Several professors at the university, which was founded in 1905, posted messages online criticizing the decision to revise the charter, saying that the school should have consulted the faculty and the students. Many of their posts were quickly deleted by censors. Sun Peidong, an associate professor of history at Fudan, said in an interview that the changes formalized the strict limits on free inquiry that have been in place at the university over the past several years.  “We don’t have to pretend anymore,” she said.  An anonymous graduate of Fudan circulated an open letter on Wednesday on WeChat, a messaging app, calling on the university to reverse course. “I earnestly hope that Fudan University can be less groveling, flattering, ingratiating, and be kindly and smartly a tower of strength,” said the letter, which was quickly removed from the internet. Fudan officials defended the changes to the charter, calling them legal, and said in a statement that they were meant to “highlight the party’s overall leadership in school work.” Two other schools also recently revised their charters, Nanjing University in eastern China and Shaanxi Normal University in northwestern China, adding vows to “maintain the comprehensive leadership of the Communist Party.” A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Education, which this month approved the charter revisions, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Some experts have warned that China’s growing restrictions on academic freedom could undermine its efforts to attract talent and build a world-class university system, as Mr. Xi has promised. Michael D. Swaine, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said revising the university charters would ultimately be counterproductive.  To survive in the long term, he said, the Communist Party will need to find new ways to promote economic growth rather than “just doubling down on Leninist norms.” Wang Yiwei contributed research.']","The backlash came after several universities adopted vows of loyalty to the Communist Party, raising concerns about academic freedom."
"In Macau, China Sees a Model for a Rebellious Hong Kong",2019-12-18,By Steven Lee Myers and Lam Yik Fei,"['MACAU — When Macau, the Portuguese colony turned Chinese gambling hub, got a new chief executive in October, the vote by an electoral committee was unanimous. He ran unopposed. No one took to the streets in protest. When young activists applied for permission to demonstrate in support of the protest movement in nearby Hong Kong, the authorities said no — four times. When a few dozen showed up anyway in Macau’s historic center in August, the police arrested seven of them. Macau today, like Hong Kong, is a political experiment that began in the late 1990s, when China reclaimed both territories from Western colonial powers and promised that civil liberties could coexist with its brand of authoritarian rule. Now, as Hong Kong’s political unrest continues, China’s ruling Communist Party has become increasingly explicit about how much it will tolerate under that formula — and holds Macau up as a shining example of obedience.  “The most important thing is to implement and safeguard the central government’s full control,” Li Zhanshu, the third highest-ranking official in China, who presides over policy for both territories, said in a speech about Macau in Beijing this month.  Compared to Hong Kong, Macau has more readily accepted Beijing’s ultimate authority on matters of national policy under the “one country, two systems” formula applied to both of them. And for the most part, the city’s 670,000 residents have gone along with it, either co-opted or coerced by the mainland. “After 20 years in Macau, it is difficult to find the clear lines between the two systems,” said Sou Ka Hou, one of 33 deputies in Macau’s Legislative Assembly and, at 28, a leader of a new generation of democratic opposition. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, arrived in Macau on Wednesday for a three-day visit to mark the 20th anniversary of the territory’s “return to the motherland” in 1999, after more than four centuries of Portuguese rule. His visit, touted in China’s state media, carries the implicit message that satrapy has its rewards. “As we used to say, good boys get candy,” said Larry So Man-yum, a retired professor of social work at Macau Polytechnic Institute who is now a gambling addiction counselor. “Macau is a good boy.” For China’s leaders, Macau offers the answer to seditious obstinacy in Hong Kong, 40 miles to the east, where protests that began in June over a bill that would have allowed extradition to the mainland have evolved into a campaign against police violence and the Communist Party’s steady encroachment on the city’s liberties. In Macau, more than half of the population was born on the mainland; millions more come to gamble in the city’s casinos, making them a driver of the economy. Government buildings all fly the Chinese flag. Schools use the mainland’s textbooks. No one boos the Chinese national anthem, as protesters regularly do in Hong Kong. Most important, Macau’s political leaders have adopted laws that curb dissent, including one in 2009 that made subversion against the Chinese state a crime. In Hong Kong, similar legislation was derailed by protests in 2003 but remains an overriding priority for the party.  Mr. Sou himself was convicted of participating in a protest last year against the Macau Foundation, a government organization, over a $14 million donation it made to a Chinese university. He was stripped of his legislative duties — a first since the handover — and only later reinstated to his seat. Mr. Sou, who rose to prominence as a leader of a civic group, is one of the few lawmakers in the city who still presses for universal suffrage, one of the key demands of Hong Kong’s protesters. He argues that Beijing has slowly chipped away at the “high degree of autonomy” it promised Macau. In September, Macau’s highest court rejected an appeal to allow a number of protests to take place, including one against the Hong Kong police. The court ruled that such a demonstration was unwarranted because none of the actions taken by Hong Kong’s police amounted to torture or brutality — an echo of the Chinese government’s argument.  One of the people who tried to organize that rally, Jason Chao, said the ruling effectively meant that any “demonstration or an assembly about an opinion not officially recognized by the government” could be banned. As Hong Kong has seethed, the authorities in Macau have stepped up efforts to quash any hint of dissent, fearing that their neighbor’s upheaval could spread. As the Friday anniversary of the handover has approached, officials have denied entry to a number of Hong Kong residents, journalists and foreigners. Two leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong were turned away as they tried to enter for an annual ball put on by the chamber’s Macau branch. On the mainland, the anniversary has occasioned tributes to Macau’s transformation under “one country, two systems.” The state television network, CCTV, broadcast a series of glowing documentaries. Air China’s in-flight magazine devoted 50 pages to it. Macau, a cluster of islands and reclaimed land totaling just 12 square miles, was the first foreign settlement in China. The Portuguese occupied it in 1557, nearly three centuries before Britain took control of Hong Kong. Twenty years after its return to China, it retains a mixture of East and West in its cuisine and in its architecture, which has won it a UNESCO listing as a World Heritage Site. It has its own judiciary and its own currency, the pataca. Portuguese remains an official language, visible on street signs and storefronts, even if fewer and fewer residents speak it. It enjoys liberties that scarcely exist on the mainland today. “If we did not have freedom of speech, I could not give you an interview today,” said Tung Chih Lin, a lecturer in the School of Public Administration at the Macau Polytechnic Institute. And it has long been the more pliant of the two former colonies under Chinese rule. The reasons for that, according to residents and historians, have to do with the different political cultures of the Portuguese and British colonial governments, and how each handled the handover to Chinese authority. When reunification approached, Portugal granted citizenship to anyone born in Macau before 1982 and their relatives. Those who balked at Chinese rule could leave for Portugal, or another European Union country. But in Hong Kong, residents received a special British passport that stopped short of citizenship, which has made resistance to Beijing an existential fight.  Macau is also different because it is the only place in China where gambling is legal — and that delivers economic benefits. An elevated light rail system that opened last week glides from the airport past the most famous global brands in gambling: the Sands, MGM, Wynn, the Venetian. Macau became the world’s biggest gambling center in 2006, surpassing Las Vegas, several years after the authorities expanded the number of casino licenses. The industry now provides 87 percent of Macau’s annual budget and jobs for nearly 1 in 12 residents, according to the latest official figures. Still more people work in hotels, restaurants and other businesses that cater to visitors, the vast majority of whom are from the mainland. Since 2008, the government has also wooed the population with yearly cash subsidies, which this year totaled the equivalent of $1,246 per person. “Macau people are overly reliant on the established economic order,” said Mr. Chao, the rights campaigner, who has moved to London. “Going against China means going against their livelihood.” Gambling is prone to economic cycles, though, and in Macau it is also vulnerable to anti-corruption campaigns in China that target high-rolling officials. Casinos have struggled in recent months, almost certainly because the tumult in Hong Kong has cut into the number of visitors.  During his visit, Mr. Xi is expected to announce new measures to knit Macau further into an ambitious project called the Greater Bay Area, meant to build closer links between the major cities where the Pearl River meets the South China Sea.  The project calls for Macau to be the region’s hub for tourism and entertainment, including attractions beyond gambling, like the annual Macau Grand Prix and the International Film Festival and Awards Macau.  That festival’s fourth installment, held last week, drew an international A-list of celebrities, including the French actress Juliette Binoche — who, when asked, said she would not subject herself to censorship for the sake of making a film in China. “I always have compassion for the audience who cannot really express themselves here,” she said. For ordinary Macanese, such concerns can seem remote, even abstract. “Many people here do not understand the importance of the universal suffrage,” said Mr. Sou, the legislator. “They only concern themselves with the life issues that happen in front of their eyes.” He warned, however, that without more democracy, Macau would lose what makes it unique. “We will just become another Chinese city,” he said.

Estonia Apologizes After Minister Calls Finland’s Leader a ‘Sales Girl’,2019-12-17,By Megan Specia,"['Estonia’s leaders have apologized after the country’s interior minister called the new prime minister of neighboring Finland, Sanna Marin, “a sales girl.” The interior minister, Mart Helme, 70, who is the leader of the far-right Estonian Conservative People’s Party, made the comment about Ms. Marin, who is 34, during a Sunday morning radio talk show as part of a larger tirade against the center-left government of Finland, which he said was trying to destroy the country from within.  “Now we can see that a sales girl has become prime minister and some other street activist and uneducated person has also become a member of the government,” Mr. Helme said, according to a translation from Finland’s state broadcaster YLE. He claimed that Finland was led by “Reds” who “are now desperately trying to liquidate Finland, making it a Euro-province.” Ms. Marin has spoken with pride about her working-class roots and about her rise from a low-income household to become the world’s youngest national leader. On Monday, she responded indirectly, on Twitter, to Mr. Helme’s comment.  “I am extremely proud of Finland,” she wrote. “Here, a child from a poor family can get educated and achieve many things in their lives. The cashier of a shop can become a prime minister.” The insult drew an immediate response from others within the Estonian government, who scrambled to control the fallout. President Kersti Kaljulaid called her Finnish counterpart to apologize for the remarks on Monday, according to the Finnish state broadcaster, and Prime Minister Juri Ratas of Estonia wrote on Facebook that he had called Ms. Marin to say sorry.  Finland and Estonia share close cultural and linguistic ties, and also share a common neighbor in Russia, whose influence they have worked to oppose in the region.  Ms. Kaljulaid said in an interview with Postimees, an Estonian newspaper, that she felt Mr. Helme was a threat to the country’s security and feared his comments could alienate an important partner in the region.  “All of this affects our security network,” she said. “The survival of a small country, especially in a geopolitically active region, depends very much on what kinds of partners and allies we have and how they see us, similar or different.” Mr. Ratas, who leads a center-right coalition government, wrote in his Facebook post of the “shared respect and agreement” between the two nations. “We now need to put this behind us and move forward with important issues to the Estonian and Finnish governments, in our countries and in the European Union,” he added. Several members of the opposition called for Mr. Helme to step down from government, and they attempted a vote of no confidence against the minister on Tuesday, though the effort ultimately failed.  “Mart Helme’s statements undermine Estonia’s international reputation,” Kaja Kallas, head of the Reform Party and leader of the opposition, said in a statement, according to the country’s state broadcaster.  “And this is no longer an internal political fight, but rather a situation that is shaming Estonia in general,” she added. Mr. Helme offered his own apology of sorts, but maintained that his words were misinterpreted, the state broadcaster reported. “That specific sentence about the Finnish prime minister, which you have interpreted as demeaning,” Mr. Helme said to reporters after a government meeting on Monday, “I have actually interpreted as complimentary — as recognition that someone can work their way up from a low social standing to the peak of politics.”  Ms. Marin became the world’s youngest prime minister last week, when her Social Democratic Party chose her to head a coalition government led by women. Four of the five women serving in the top government posts, including Ms. Marin, are under 35.  Ms. Marin was selected after a turbulent time that saw Prime Minister Antti Rinne resign over criticism from within the coalition of the handling of a postal workers’ strike.  The shift in leadership thrust Ms. Marin into the international spotlight, but she has waved away the focus on her age and instead emphasized her policy plans.  Mr. Rinne remains the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, but Ms. Marin is expected to challenge him for the party leadership at its convention this summer. She first entered Parliament in 2015 and previously served as the minister of transport and communications. She is seen as left-leaning even within her party, with human rights, climate change and social welfare at the top of her political agenda. While many on the left have applauded her appointment to prime minister as a symbol of growing gender and age equity in Finnish politics, it comes at an especially polarized time in the country.  In elections in April, the Social Democrats only narrowly edged out the right-wing, populist Finns Party.

Accused Dutch Crime Boss Is Arrested in Dubai Mansion,2019-12-18,By Claire Moses,"['The Netherlands’ most wanted man, described by the authorities as the kingpin atop a large and lethal criminal organization, is so elusive that he has never been convicted of a major crime. In fact, the authorities were long unsure of where he was. But on Monday, the police in Dubai closed in on a mansion in a wealthy neighborhood there and arrested the man, Ridouan Taghi, on international warrants on charges of murder and drug trafficking, and the Dutch authorities said on Thursday that he had been flown back to the Netherlands. News of the arrest of Mr. Taghi, 41, was met with praise and jubilation in the Netherlands, where the accusations against him are well known, despite his efforts to keep a low profile. The Ministry of Justice and Security says that he leads a major cocaine smuggling operation and has had a hand in 11 killings. “The political implications of the arrest are big,” said G.J. Alexander Knoops, a professor of the politics of international law at the University of Amsterdam. “It probably is one of the most important arrests for the law enforcement agencies in the Netherlands in the last couple of years.”  Interest in Mr. Taghi intensified in September, when a lawyer, Derk Wiersum, was shot dead in Amsterdam — a killing that the authorities suspect Mr. Taghi of ordering. Mr. Wiersum, a 44-year-old father of two, was representing a prosecution witness in a murder case against Mr. Taghi — who is being tried in absentia — and some of his associates.  Later that month, prosecutors added more allegations to the trial, charging Mr. Taghi with murdering an employee of a shop that sold spy equipment in 2015, and a crime blogger in 2016. They also charged him over two previous attempts to murder the blogger — in one instance by planting a bomb under his car — and the attempted murder of another man in Rotterdam. Inez Weski, a lawyer for Mr. Taghi, withdrew from the trial in October, arguing that the proceedings were unfair. Her office declined to comment on his arrest. While Mr. Taghi’s arrest is an undeniable milestone — the justice minister, Ferdinand Grapperhaus, called it “very good news” — the authorities say that an organization run by him is still operating. After the murder of Mr. Wiersum in September, dozens of Dutch officials received increased protection, reflecting what law enforcement officials said was the threat posed by the gang that Mr. Taghi is accused of running.  “That is an unprecedented situation for the Netherlands,” said Yelle Tieleman, a crime reporter for the Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, adding that such extensive surveillance and security “takes up a lot of police capacity.” The Netherlands does not have an extradition agreement with the United Arab Emirates, but the Dutch authorities said on Thursday morning that Mr. Taghi had been deported from Dubai and flown back to the Netherlands in a chartered plane. Morocco also had its eyes on Mr. Taghi, who is wanted there over the 2017 murder of the son of a prominent judge in Marrakesh. Morocco and the Emirates do have an extradition agreement. Mr. Taghi arrived in Dubai in 2016, using a Dutch passport issued under a different name, the Dubai police chief, Jamal Al Jallaf, told the Dutch broadcaster NOS. While there, Dubai officials said, Mr. Taghi rarely left his home and took measures to remain under the radar. “The curtains were always closed,” Mr. Al Jallaf said. “Taghi was careful, very careful.” Mr. Taghi had moved to the Netherlands from Morocco as a toddler and grew up in the Utrecht region, where as a young man he was part of a youth gang called “the Bad Boys,” according to Dutch news outlets. He came into contact with the police in connection with burglaries and fights, but managed not to draw much attention. Starting in the 1980s, a group of young Dutch mobsters gained a kind of celebrity status — notably Willem Holleeder, one of the men who in 1983 kidnapped Freddy Heineken, the chief executive of the brewing company, and his driver. The victims were freed, and the kidnappers were caught and went to prison. Mr. Holleeder, who went on to commit other high-profile crimes, became so famous that he gave an interview in 2012 to a talk show on national television. His sister, Astrid Holleeder, wrote a best-selling memoir about helping the authorities take down her brother. This year, at age 61, he was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in multiple murders. The high profile of that group of criminals and the attention that law enforcement paid them allowed other younger people to rise while staying in the background, said Marian Husken, who writes books on Dutch crime. As Mr. Holleeder and his contemporaries have been imprisoned or killed, others have filled the vacuum, and the attention of law enforcement is now squarely on them, experts say. “By trying and convicting these people, you don’t solve the underlying problem that the Netherlands is a transit country for cocaine,” said Sven Brinkhoff, an associate professor of criminal law at the Open University in Utrecht. “New people always rise up.”']","Ridouan Taghi, 41, is accused of being involved in multiple killings and of heading a criminal gang that smuggles drugs.

U.N. Peacekeepers in Haiti Said to Have Fathered Hundreds of Children,2019-12-18,By Elian Peltier,"['United Nations peacekeepers in Haiti fathered and left behind hundreds of children, researchers found in a newly released academic study, leaving mothers struggling with stigma, poverty and single parenthood after the men departed the country.  While the United Nations has acknowledged numerous instances of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers in Haiti and elsewhere, the study on Haitian victims went further in documenting the scope of the problem in that country — the Western Hemisphere’s poorest — than had been previously known.  “Girls as young as 11 were sexually abused and impregnated” by peacekeepers, who were stationed in Haiti from 2004 to 2017, and some of the women were later “left in misery” to raise their children alone, according to the study by two academic researchers. “They put a few coins in your hands to drop a baby in you,” one Haitian was quoted as saying by the researchers, whose work was published on Tuesday by The Conversation, an academic website supported by a consortium of universities.  The study, based on interviews with 2,500 Haitians who lived near peacekeeper bases in the summer of 2017, depicts a trail of abuse and exploitation left by some of the soldiers and civilians who served in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti, known as Minustah, an acronym for its name in French. The resulting children are known as “petits minustahs.” Asked for comment, the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations said in a statement that it took the issues raised in the study seriously and that combating sexual exploitation and abuse committed by peacekeepers is a top priority of Secretary General António Guterres. “We have unfortunately seen cases involving Minustah peacekeepers over the past years, although allegations have been generally declining since 2013,” the statement said.  The United Nations has previously acknowledged that more than 100 Sri Lankan peacekeepers deployed to Haiti exploited nine children in a sex ring from 2004 to 2007, and the men were sent home, but were not punished. The new study, by Sabine Lee, a history professor at the University of Birmingham, and Susan Bartels, a clinician scientist at Queen’s University in Ontario, is the latest to document sexual misconduct by international peacekeeping forces, including those stationed in Mozambique, in Bosnia, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the Central African Republic.  Of the people interviewed by the authors, 265 told of children fathered by members of the peacekeeping force, who came from at least 13 countries but mostly Uruguay and Brazil, according to a chart in the study.  “That 10 percent of those interviewed mentioned such children highlights just how common such stories really are,” they wrote. They noted that over the years, news organizations had reported anecdotal cases in Haiti in which “minors were offered food and small amounts of cash to have sex with U.N. personnel.” The authors did not estimate the exact numbers of impregnated women or children left behind. But legal experts and aid workers say the problem has been pervasive, and that the United Nations has failed to assist the women. The Bureau des Avocats Internationaux, a group of Haitian lawyers based in Port-au-Prince, has filed paternity suits on behalf of 10 children said to have been fathered by peacekeepers. Sienna Merope-Synge, a staff attorney at a Boston-based partner organization, the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, said the groups had approached United Nations officials in 2016 about securing child support for the mothers but had received none. “The U.N. must be much more proactive,” she said. “It shouldn’t be on a woman in rural Haiti to seek transnational action for a man in Uruguay.” Others were far more critical of the United Nations, seeing the Haiti study as another instance of what they called the organization’s male-dominated ethos. Paula Donovan, a co-founder and co-director of AIDS-Free World, a group that has frequently castigated the United Nations over sexual abuse and gender issues, said the study had corroborated her views. “This research confirms that standard U.N. practice is to exploit women — from those subsisting in tents to those presenting at conferences — and then squash them like bugs if they dare complain about sexual abuse and threaten the U.N. patriarchy’s 75-year-old culture of entitlement and impunity,” Ms. Donovan said in a statement. While some mothers told the researchers of sexual violence by United Nations personnel, most of the stories recounted subtler forms of coercion, with peacekeepers trading small amounts of money or food for sex with women and girls who were often desperately poor. In other instances, women and their relatives described consensual relationships that ended when the peacekeepers left Haiti.  The authors said Haitians residing in communities around 10 United Nations bases had been asked “what it’s like to be a woman or a girl living in a community that hosts a peacekeeping mission.” The Haitians were not asked specifically about potential abuse or sexual relations with peacekeepers, according to the study, but participants raised the issue themselves. “I started to talk to him, then he told me he loved me and I agreed to date him,” a woman was quoted as saying of her relationship several years earlier with a peacekeeper. “Three months later, I was pregnant, and in September he was sent to his country.” She added that she could not pay the fees to send her son to school. The testimonies echoed a pattern seen in Liberia between 1990 and 1998, when thousands of children were reported to have been fathered by international peacekeepers. In Haiti, the peacekeeping mission began as an attempt to bring stability after the 2004 rebellion that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the United Nations extended it after a catastrophic earthquake ravaged the country in 2010.  But the mission itself was devastating, according to human rights organizations and researchers. Peacekeepers have been accused of unintentionally killing dozens of civilians, and some introduced cholera to Haiti after the earthquake, starting an epidemic that killed more than 10,000 people and sickened more than 800,000. The United Nations has apologized for its role in the epidemic but has resisted legal efforts aimed at compensating cholera victims and their families. The study’s authors recommended that the United Nations educate its personnel about the economic and social hardships of the mothers and children left behind. They also urged the world body to stop simply repatriating its people who are implicated in sexual exploitation or abuse, rather than turning them over to local authorities. Ms. Lee, the lead author of the study, said member states that contribute troops to United Nations’ peacekeeping efforts also bore direct responsibility to help support the mothers and children.  “It’s not a U.N. problem, it’s a Brazilian military problem, or a Uruguayan military problem,” Ms. Lee said. “The U.N., though, hasn’t found a way to hold the troops of the member states to account.” Rick Gladstone contributed reporting.']","Women and girls were left behind to face poverty, social stigma and single motherhood in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country.

Deadly Gunfire at Russia Spy Agency’s Moscow Headquarters,2019-12-19,By Andrew Higgins and Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — Shooting erupted near the fortresslike headquarters of Russia’s Federal Security Service in central Moscow on Thursday evening, the spy agency reported in a series of statements that also said one of its agents had been killed.  The agency, known by its Russian acronym F.S.B., said an “unknown person opened fire” near the headquarters and had been “neutralized.” The assailant’s identity and motive were not immediately clear.  The Izvestia news site said that Thursday’s shooting broke out in the reception area of the headquarters, known as the Lubyanka, and that up to three people had been killed, at least some of them F.S.B. employees. The Interfax news agency quoted the Health Ministry as saying five people were wounded in the shooting and had been “provided with medical aid.” The shooting was highly unusual for a heavily guarded area that is home to the vast headquarters of the F.S.B. — the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B. — as well as to many other government buildings.  The area around the building was quickly cordoned off by police officers.  The shooting happened on the same day that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K.G.B. agent, gave his annual televised news conference and hailed Russia’s political stability. Shortly after Mr. Putin ended the marathon session with journalists, which lasted more than four hours, the Moscow night was filled with the shriek of sirens as the police and ambulances raced to the F.S.B. headquarters.  The shooting could have carried a symbolic significance. It happened around the same time as the next event on Mr. Putin’s agenda — a speech he was delivering at an annual celebration held for security agency workers in the Kremlin, about a half-mile away from the scene.  Russian security agencies, and the F.S.B. in particular, have been seen by Mr. Putin’s critics as the backbone of his rule. Their significance had waned following the Soviet collapse, much to the dismay of many agents, but was restored by Mr. Putin with the F.S.B. evolving into a force that is enormous and feared. Multiple videos from the scene, posted by bystanders who happened to be in this busy area of the Russian capital, showed roving groups of police officers as loud gunshots were audible in the background. One police officer can be heard shouting to bystanders to run away. The mayhem came more than a year after an October 2018 bomb attack by a Russian teenager on an F.S.B. office in the northern city of Arkhangelsk. The bombing triggered a nationwide crackdown by the security forces on anyone suspected of harboring hostility toward the F.S.B.  The F.S.B.’s massive stone headquarters building in Moscow was last attacked in 2015 when a Russian performance artist, Petr Pavlensky, set fire to its wooden doors.  The building, constructed at the end of the 19th century for an insurance company and then heavily rebuilt during Soviet times, has been the headquarters of Russia’s secret police since soon after the 1917 communist revolution. It acquired a forbidding reputation as a center of brutal repression during Stalin’s Great Terror of 1936-38, when its basement cells were used for torture and executions.  In the final years of the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1991, a square in front of what was then the K.G.B. headquarters became the scene of frequent protests by pro-democracy activists. In August 1991 they tore down a statue of the first secret police chief after the revolution, Felix Dzerzhinsky.  Since Mr. Putin came to power nearly 20 years ago, the area around the Lubyanka has been off limits for protests.']",Russian news reports said up to three people were killed and five wounded in a shooting in or near the reception area of the Federal Security Service headquarters in central Moscow.
E.U. Lawmakers Condemn Subsidy Corruption but Disagree on What to Do,2019-12-17,By Matt Apuzzo,"['BRUSSELS — European Union lawmakers on Tuesday strongly criticized corruption and self-dealing in the bloc’s $65-billion-a-year farm subsidy program but were sharply divided over how or whether to reform a system that has become a third rail of European politics. At a time of festering anti-European sentiment, the debate over one of the world’s largest subsidy programs highlighted a fissure that cuts far deeper than a simple dispute over farm policy. It raised the question of how to combat political corruption without infringing on the independence of the bloc’s 28 nations — and further emboldening its far-right populist critics. Tuesday’s debate happened during a European Parliament budget oversight hearing, which was prompted, in part, by a New York Times investigation into the farm subsidy program, known as the Common Agricultural Policy or C.A.P.  In November, the Times revealed how subsidies help underwrite oligarchs, enrich politicians and encourage land-grabbing and Mafia-style tactics.  “The recent New York Times report on the abuse of C.A.P. subsidies is damning and undermines trust in government,” said Mick Wallace, a European lawmaker from Ireland. The Times tracked state land sales and subsidies that benefited friends and family members of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, while also identifying at least $79 million in government subsidies paid to companies owned by the Andrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic.  “It quite ironic to see populists such as Andrej Babis and Viktor Orban making such hue and cry about how European Union money is spent, while the same two people use E.U. money to enrich their friends,” said Lara Wolters, a lawmaker from the Netherlands and member of the budget oversight committee. In the hearing, Ms. Wolters argued that Parliament should reconsider the core premise of the subsidy program — that farmers are paid based on how much land they control. Such a change would curb the ability of national leaders to use farmland as political chits. And it could reduce the incentives for large, politically powerful companies to acquire more land. But it would also amount to a seismic overhaul of a fund regarded as sacrosanct by many national politicians and many farmers.  European lawmakers are now debating the renewal of the bloc’s next seven-year farm bill. National leaders want more discretion on how to spend the money, and farmers want fewer administrative requirements. In Brussels, there is little appetite for a major reform that would impose greater oversight on governments — even those that have manipulated or abused the system.  So the latest proposal, which will be debated in the coming months, gives national leaders like Mr. Babis and Mr. Orban even greater power to set farm policy and oversee spending, despite allegations of corruption. Internal auditors have criticized that proposal, and several lawmakers objected Tuesday.  “We can’t even adequately police corruption,” said Sheila Ritchie of Scotland. “What on Earth makes us think self-policing compliance is going to work?” Johannes Hahn, the European budget administrator, defended the bloc’s approach to corruption and abuse, noting that European auditors have investigated and audited Mr. Babis.  “We have reacted very quickly,” he said.  But the Babis investigations also reveal how accountability is still limited. Years ago, European investigators recommended that Mr. Babis be charged with fraud, but they lack jurisdiction or authority to bring charges. The case has languished in the Czech Republic. And the audit is expected to drag on for many months, during which time Mr. Babis can still vote on the European budget. The European Union is not a government but an economic and political bloc. While it has a system of shared laws, the union is built on the concept of national sovereignty.  Those tensions bubbled over on Tuesday, as some lawmakers strongly rejected suggestions that cracking down on corruption required the European Union to take on new oversight. “Some colleagues want the E.U. to have even greater responsibilities and to supervise member states even more,” Tomislav Sokol, a Croatian lawmaker, said during the hearing, held in Strasbourg, France. “But member states should look after their own interests. Solutions should not be imposed by the European Union.” The clearest divisions, though, were between lawmakers calling for a significant overhaul of the subsidy program and those who argued for keeping it intact. “The story here isn’t actually about a few bad apples robbing funds,” said Clare Daly, an Irish lawmaker. “The problem is actually the system itself.” Such sentiments elicited a rebuke from Clara Aguilera of Spain, who is also a member of the agricultural committee.  “There are people who are trying to make these problems into a general condemnation of the C.A.P.,” she said. “I refuse to join in this blanket condemnation.”']",A Times investigation showed how oligarchs and political patrons make millions in farm subsidies. But the program is all but sacrosanct.
2 North Koreans Tried to Defect. Did Seoul Send Them to Their Deaths?,2019-12-18,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — In early November, two North Korean fishermen captured in South Korean waters were escorted to the inter-Korean border, blindfolded and tied with ropes\u200b. There, they were handed over to the North Korean authorities. South Korea often reveals the seizure of North Korean fishermen in its waters once it happens. This time, the episode was kept secret — until an army \u200bofficer on the border sent a text message \u200breporting the handover \u200bto a senior presidential aide, and a photographer captured the message on the aide’s smartphone\u200b. \u200bR\u200bevelation after shocking revelation\u200b has since followed, leaving human rights groups and advocates, including South Korea’s bar association, agape with outrage. As lawmakers looked into the matter, officials admitted that the two \u200bfishermen, ages 22 and 23, submitted \u200bhand-\u200bwritten statements \u200bin which they said they hoped to defect to South Korea. \u200bBut after a few days of interrogation, South Korea concluded that they were not refugees needing protection but “heinous criminals” who butchered the captain and 15 other crewmen on their boat. The two were denied access to lawyers, a court hearing or a chance to appeal the government’s decision to repatriate them.\u200b Until their blindfolds were taken off at the border, they did not know where they were being taken. When they finally realized it, one of them collapsed, according to lawmakers briefed by officials. For the two men, their return to North Korea could mean their likely execution.\u200b Tens of thousands of North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the de facto end of the Korean War in 1953. \u200bUntil now, the South had accepted all defectors, regardless of their criminal records, because North Koreans technically qualified as South Korean citizens under the South’s Constitution.  For years, the United Nations\u200b \u200bhas \u200blamented widespread lack of due process in North Korea\u200b, reporting torture, starvation, murder and other crimes against humanity perpetrated against criminal suspects, especially those forcibly repatriated from abroad. \u200b “Forcibly repatriating \u200bthem was an act against\u200b \u200bhumanity that violated international law,” Won Yoo-chul, an opposition lawmaker, told \u200ba highly emotional hearing in Parliament last month. “Their repatriation constitutes a murder through willful negligence because South Korea sent them to the North, fully aware that they would be executed there.” The case of the two fishermen was also unusual because it marked the first in which South Korea rejected North Korean defectors because of their alleged crimes in the North or because their intent to defect was considered disingenuous. In a joint statement this week, Human Rights Watch and 66 other rights groups \u200baccused \u200b\u200bSouth Korea \u200bof failing in its obligation under international treaties to “protect anyone who would be at substantial risk of torture or other serious human rights violations after repatriation.” \u200bFew personal details have been revealed about the two North Korean\u200bs, except that one was the boatswain and the other a deck hand. Their fateful journey began on Aug. 15, when their 17-ton wooden boat with 19 men on board cast off from Kimchaek\u200b on the east coast of North Korea, South Korean\u200b officials said. The two\u200b, together with the ship’s chief engineer, mutinied against the captain’s abuse \u200bon a late October\u200b night\u200b, killing him with hammers and axes. They then went on a killing spree to hide their crime. They awakened the\u200bir \u200bcolleagues two at a time, lured them outside and butchered them, throwing their bodies overboard.  They steered their ship back to Kimchaek, hoping to sell the squid and flee inland\u200b. When the engineer was arrested by the Kimchaek\u200b police\u200b, the other two fled back to the sea. By the time their boat \u200bapproached the inter-Korean sea border on Oct. 31, the South Korean authorities said they had picked up intelligence that \u200bNorth Korea was looking for \u200bthem. South Korean patrol boats fired\u200b warning shots and broadcast warnings, a standard procedure when a North Korean fishing boat crosses the border without signaling that those on the boat are defecting\u200b. The boat repeatedly crossed back and forth across the maritime border for two days, until South Korean Navy commandoes \u200bfinally \u200bseized \u200bit on Nov. 2.\u200b Both men quickly confessed to mass murder, providing identical details of the\u200b crime during separate interrogations, South Korean officials said. They then said they wanted to defect to the South\u200b. “We decided to expel them because they were atrocious criminals who could threaten the lives and safety of our people if accepted into our society,” said the South Korean unification minister, Kim Yeon-chul,\u200b who added that the two “lacked sincerity when they said they wanted to defect.” Few matters \u200bare that simple on the divided Korean Peninsula, however. Although the South’s Constitution claims North Korea as part of its territory, both \u200bsides in reality have also recognize\u200bd\u200b each other’s territorial sovereignty. They joined the United Nations at the same time, and have held summit meetings and signed agreements to bolster economic and other forms of cooperation. In the past decade, South Korea has returned 185 North Korean fishermen adrift in its waters\u200b who wanted to return home. In the same period, North Korea sent home 16 South Koreans who entered the North illegally. In previously holding to its policy of never returning any North Koreans who said they wanted to defect, the South had welcomed people with tainted pasts. At least 270 \u200bNorth Korean defectors living in the South have been disqualified from government subsidies for various reasons, including nine who had committed murder or\u200b other serious \u200bcrimes before coming to South Korea, according to government data. Separately, 215 defectors lost such subsidies in the last five years for committing various crimes in South Korea.  “I am just flabbergasted,” wrote Joo Sung-ha, a defector-turned-journalist in Seoul\u200b, referring to the South’s refusal to believe the two North Koreans’ stated intention to defect. “If they defected\u200b to the South, they \u200bhad a chance to live, and if they \u200breturned to the North, \u200bit was 100 percent \u200bcertain that they \u200bwould die. Under such circumstances, \u200bwasn’t it natural for them to want to defect?” Rights advocates were especially disappointed because the office of President Moon Jae-in coordinated the repatriation. Before winning the presidency, Mr. Moon \u200bhad been a famed human rights lawyer who once defended six Korean-Chinese men who \u200bmurdered 11 \u200bcrewmen, including seven South Koreans, on a tuna fishing boat in 1996. “President Moon Jae-in and his government are ignoring North Korea’s grave human rights abuses in a misguided effort to mollify Kim Jong-un and improve relations with Pyongyang,” said Phil Robertson, the Asia deputy director at Human Rights Watch. \u200bInstead of hurrying to repatriate the\u200b two North Koreans, South Korea should have thoroughly investigated the case\u200b, including “whether ‘the brutal criminals’ were in reality not the abusers but victims of the harsh circumstance of North Korea,” Ra Jong-yil, the former deputy director of the South’s National Intelligence Service, wrote in the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper. But under \u200bits legal system, South Korea could not have prosecuted the two men because the criminal evidence was in the North\u200b, officials and other lawmakers said\u200b. They feared that letting the two North Korean fishermen stay free in the South would have been a betrayal of the victims of their alleged crime, and might help turn South Korea into a safe haven for criminals on the run from the North. “This is one of the best things the Unification Ministry and the National Intelligence Service have done recently,” said Lee Seok-hyun, a governing party lawmaker, referring to \u200bthe agencies involved in the repatriation.\u200b Conspicuously absent from the debate\u200b, however\u200b, are the voices of the two North \u200bKoreans who were sent back to their homeland. Since they were returned, North Korea has not spoken a word about their fate.']","The repatriation of two squid fishermen, to what rights activists said was a certain execution in North Korea, has incited outrage in the South.

Pope Francis Abolishes Secrecy Policy in Sexual Abuse Cases,2019-12-17,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The Vatican on Tuesday said it would abolish the high level of secrecy it has applied to sexual-abuse accusations against clerics, ending a policy that critics said had often shielded priests from criminal punishment by the secular authorities. Removing that cloak of confidentiality, the Roman Catholic Church is changing its stance to make it acceptable — but not required — to turn information about abuse claims over to the police, prosecutors and judges. In recent years, church officials in the United States and some other countries have shared with civil authorities information about some sexual abuse allegations. But that cooperation, in theory, defied a decree adopted in 2001 that made the information a “pontifical secret” — the church’s most classified knowledge. Victims and their advocates said the restrictions hampered civil authorities and helped conceal crimes, and they greeted Francis’ new instructions as a step forward. “Things are decidedly changing,” said Francesco Zanardi, an Italian survivor of clerical abuse and the president of Rete l’Abuso, an Italian anti-abuse group. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a group that tracks abuse in the church, said the pope had taken “an overdue and desperately needed step.” “For decades, pontifical secrecy has been an obstruction to civil justice, spurring bishops worldwide to thwart prosecutions of abusive priests,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said in a statement. She called changing the policy “a first step toward decreasing the anti-victim bias of canon law.” On Tuesday, the pope also made the canon law against child pornography more stringent, a change that victims’ groups had pushed for. Previously, possession or dissemination of pornographic images of children under 14 was considered a “most grave crime.” That category that will now apply to images of children under 18. The secrecy change is the latest step in the church’s attempts to tackle the sexual abuse crisis that has dogged it for decades. Growing global pressure for greater accountability forced the issue to the front of Pope Francis’ agenda. In response to the demands for change, Francis convened a summit meeting of church leaders in February to address the crisis. It ended with a call “for an all-out battle against the abuse of minors” and insistence that the church needed to protect children “from ravenous wolves.” Weeks after that meeting, the pope issued a new canon law, requiring for the first time that church officials report abuse charges to Vatican prosecutors. Francis then issued a rule requiring that all church officials report to their superiors either abuse allegations or attempts to cover them up. The rule announced on Tuesday was also a product of the February meeting, the Vatican said. “This is a sign of openness, transparency and the willingness to collaborate with the civil authorities,” Andrea Tornielli, the editorial director of the Vatican’s communications office, wrote in a commentary. Under the new norms, “any reporting, testimony and documents” related to sexual abuse “can now be handed over when requested to lawful authorities in their respective countries,” Mr. Tornielli wrote. The Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Vatican’s child protection commission, said, “This is pretty much revolutionary.”  Ms. Barrett Doyle was less confident. “The impact of this change will be determined by how broadly it is applied,” she said. It was not clear, for example, whether the new policy would be applied retroactively, she said. Ms. Barrett Doyle and other victim advocates, while praising the change, said it did not address many of the other issues they have raised, like the fact that the church has not adopted a policy of defrocking any priest who has abused a child. “It’s a little-known, appalling fact that under universal church law, guilty priests still are allowed to remain in ministry,” Ms. Barrett Doyle said. The Vatican had previously argued that the imposition of pontifical secrecy was necessary to protect both victim and accused. Church officials also said they could not insist that abuse allegations be reported to the civil authorities because in many parts of the world, that would put priests’ lives in danger. But critics said the rules deterred victims from coming forward and helped cover up sexual abuse. Father Zollner said that confidentiality was never supposed to be a “hiding place for the church, but unfortunately it was used” that way “many times.” The new guidelines, which go into effect on Jan. 1, specify that “confidentiality shall not prevent the fulfillment of the obligations laid down in all places by civil laws, including any reporting obligations, and the execution of enforceable requests of civil judicial authorities.” Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, the Vatican’s chief sex crime investigator, called Francis’ decree an “epochal decision that removes obstacles and impediments.” The changes do not affect the secrecy of confession. The instructions also made clear that even if documents and testimony produced in canonical trials are shared with civil law enforcement officials or other interested parties, they may not be made public. “The right of the victims and the witnesses to confidentiality must always be protected,” Mr. Tornielli wrote. “Now, however, the documentation must be placed at the disposal of the civil authority for the purpose of investigating cases for which canonical proceedings have already begun.” On Tuesday, the pope accepted the resignation of Archbishop Luigi Ventura, the Vatican ambassador to France, who has been under investigation in France for sexual assault. In July, the Vatican revoked his diplomatic immunity.']",Church officials can now share information with secular law enforcement authorities. Critics said the confidentiality rule led to the concealment of abuse.
"Putin Hints at Holding Power Past 2024, and Defends Trump on Impeachment",2019-12-19,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Just hours after President Trump became only the third American leader to be impeached, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday mocked what he described as an attempt by Democrats to reverse the 2016 election, and hinted that he could, himself, stay in power for many more years. [Update: Putin endorses legislation enabling him to run for president again.] Taking questions for more than four hours at his annual end-of-year news conference, the Russian president embraced Republican talking points, deriding the impeachment process in Washington as baseless and destined to fail. “This is nothing but a continuation of an internal political struggle, with the party that lost the election, the Democratic Party, trying to reach its goal by different means,” Mr. Putin said during the 15th edition of the news conference, a well-worn ritual that the president uses to parade his mastery of domestic policy detail and take swipes at political tumult overseas. Mr. Putin was far less emphatic in his take on Russia’s own political affairs, particularly its next presidential election in 2024. He sidestepped a direct question about his future plans, while raising the possibility that Russia’s Constitution, which bars him from seeking another term, might be changed. Moscow has been abuzz for months with speculation about whether Mr. Putin, who has been in power for 20 years, will step down at the end of his current and supposedly final term in 2024. Wary of declaring himself a lame duck and triggering a destabilizing succession struggle, Mr. Putin has kept his plans secret. His comments on Thursday were so ambiguous that they set off another round of Kremlin tea-leaf reading. His musing publicly about revising the Constitution, which bars a president from serving more than two successive terms, raised the possibility that he may want to run for a third consecutive term — which would keep him in office through 2030 — and possibly more. But it could also mean that he wants to remove only the reference to consecutive terms, which would actually strengthen the two-term limit. That would prevent future presidents from repeating his own controversial maneuver in 2008, when he stepped down after two terms to become prime minister — while holding onto most of his power — only to return four years later for a third presidential term. He also found another way to extend his grip on power, lengthening the terms from four years to six. In an interview with state television after the news conference, Mr. Putin played down the significance of his comment, saying that he had simply answered a question put to him about the Constitution, adding, “I can’t say this was something prepared from my side.” He said he was open to the idea of increasing the powers of Russia’s Parliament, which has become little more than a rubber stamp and cheerleading squad for the Kremlin. A more powerful Parliament “is quite justified in principle,” he said. “But you can’t take rash steps on this and you can’t be in a hurry.” Proud of his role in ending the political turmoil that convulsed Russia under his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin,  Mr. Putin has made stability — his critics say stagnation — the centerpiece of his two decades in power. The contrast between Mr. Putin’s seemingly immovable role in Russia and the tumultuous political fighting in the United States could hardly be starker. The Kremlin, which rooted against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and interfered to benefit Mr. Trump, has watched Washington’s noisy partisan feuds with glee, seeing them as proof that Russia, which has not had a fair presidential election since Mr. Putin took power, has chosen the right path. Offering an analysis of America’s political tumult, Mr. Putin said that Mr. Trump was unlikely to be removed for “highly speculative reasons” by the Republican-controlled Senate. As in the past, Mr. Putin focused on domestic affairs during his marathon news conference, answering questions about garbage collection, airfares to the Russian Far East, doctors’ salaries and many other, sometimes microscopic local issues. The event, attended by hundreds of journalists and broadcast live on state television, has often tended to be more a carnival of flattery than a news event. At Thursday’s event, a journalist from Yekaterinburg was called on to ask a question while holding up a sign reading: “I love Putin.” And another reporter held a sign that said she wanted to ask “about dogs,” a topic eagerly addressed by the president, a dog lover, in previous years. More hard-hitting questions went mostly unanswered. Asked whether he would acknowledge that two women widely reported to be his daughters were indeed his children, Mr. Putin veered off into a long disquisition about the importance of developing high-tech projects in Russia. One of the women named as his daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, is involved in a multimillion-dollar, high-tech development project funded in part by the state. He was more forthcoming about foreign affairs, but stuck mostly to well-practiced denials of well-documented Russian involvement in various misdeeds abroad. He denied that Russian troops were involved in a war that has killed more than 13,000 people in eastern Ukraine, and denounced as unfair and unfounded the World Anti-Doping Agency’s recent decision to ban Russian teams from the Olympics and other international competitions. Mr. Putin used a question from Dimitri K. Simes, a Russian-born American expert on Russia, to riff about American politics and take another swipe at findings that Moscow had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. United States intelligence agencies declared in January 2017 that Mr. Putin had personally ordered an “influence campaign” to tilt the 2016 vote in Mr. Trump’s favor, an assessment that both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump have repeatedly rejected. “First they accuse Trump of a collusion with Russia. Then it turns out there was no collusion, so this cannot be used as a basis for impeachment,” Mr. Putin said. “Now they’ve come up with the idea he put pressure on Ukraine.”']","Russia’s president mused about repealing the term limit he faces, and echoed Republican talking points saying that impeachment was a baseless bid to reverse the 2016 election."
Indonesia Lets Plastic Burning Continue Despite Warning on Toxins,2019-12-19,By Richard C. Paddock,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — The Indonesian government, stung by a report that found burning plastic for fuel is poisoning residents in an East Java village, is allowing the illegal burning to continue while it challenges the environmental study. Tofu makers in the village, Tropodo, who have long burned waste plastic to fuel their kitchen boilers, have seen sales plummet in recent weeks over fears that dioxin, a toxic chemical, produced from the fires is contaminating their tofu. Rather than enforce a ban on the burning of waste plastic, much of which came until recently from the United States, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry appointed a panel of Indonesian experts to counter the report released last month by Indonesian and international environmental groups. At a news conference, officials said the Tropodo test was flawed because it relied on testing dioxin levels in chicken eggs. Eggs are commonly used for testing contamination because chickens effectively sample the soil as they forage and toxins accumulate in their eggs. “Chickens are smart,” said one government expert, Mochamad Lazuardi, a professor of veterinary medicine at Airlangga University in the city of Surabaya. “They will not eat something hazardous.” Indonesia prohibits the open burning of waste but the law is widely flouted by residents and garbage dump operators alike who commonly burn plastic along with other trash. Indonesian officials have neglected environmental concerns for the sake of economic development and one result has been widespread contamination by toxic chemicals such as dioxin, mercury and lead. Dioxin is one of the most hazardous known chemicals and can cause cancer, birth defects and Parkinson’s disease. Testing by the environmental groups found one sample in Tropodo that contained the second-highest level of dioxin ever found in Asia. The Tropodo dioxin study was conducted by four environmental groups: Ecoton and the Nexus3 Foundation, based in Indonesia; Arnika, based in Prague; and the International Pollutants Elimination Network or IPEN, a global network dedicated to eliminating toxic pollutants. Samples they collected in Tropodo and the nearby village of Bangun, where plastic waste is sorted and burned, were tested at laboratories in three European countries. The environment ministry officials and three Indonesian university professors who will conduct the government study challenged the validity of the original test and questioned whether the egg samples were cracked and contaminated externally. The study’s authors stood by their findings. They said none of the egg samples were cracked or tainted and encouraged the government to put an end to plastic burning as soon as possible. “It would be prudent to halt plastic burning, as our data indicates that more plastic burning will result in more dioxin formation and pollution,” the study’s authors said in a statement. But one government official indicated that a ban on burning plastic would not be enforced until it was clear how it would affect the local economy.  “It is clear that open burning is not allowed,” said Novrizal Tahar, the director of waste management at the environment ministry. “But we need to conduct a social economy study in Tropodo.” The findings of the environmental groups caused widespread concern in East Java over the safety of eggs and tofu produced in the area. To reassure the public that eggs were safe to eat, the governor of East Java Province, Khofifah Indar Parawansa, and dozens of members of the provincial parliament stood and ate boiled eggs together at a recent session. In Tropodo, some tofu makers said they would switch to wood for their fuel. “They are upset because the demand for tofu has fallen due to the issue of dioxin,” Mr. Novrizal said. “Therefore, they issued a statement that they would switch and not use plastic waste anymore as their fuel.” But it was unclear how many tofu makers actually made the change. Black smoke consistent with burning plastic continued to bellow last week from many of the chimneys that tower over the village. Several tofu makers who had switched to wood fuel allowed a journalist to see their operations and take photos but many others refused to allow access to their kitchens. Some of the plastic trash burned by the tofu makers came from the United States and other countries, where it was initially intended for recycling but was improperly shipped to Indonesia as paper waste. In an effort to reduce the amount of plastic being burned, Mr. Novrizal said Indonesia has sent 883 containers of foreign waste back to their countries of origin. Environmentalists say that the government’s handling of toxic pollution in Tropodo is a troublesome sign given its plans to build a dozen waste-to-energy incinerators in major cities around the country. Four of the incinerators would be in greater Jakarta, already one of the world’s most polluted cities. Under the government’s plan, the amount of dioxin produced by the incinerators would be monitored once every five years, compared to the European standard of twice a year. Critics of the plan said it would increase air pollution and create large amounts of ash containing dioxin and other toxic chemicals. “Operating an incinerator without dioxin monitoring is like driving with your eyes closed,” said the Tropodo study authors. Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']",The Indonesian government pushed back on an international study that found high levels of dioxin in a village where plastic is burned to produce tofu.
"A Rare Russian Tech Triumph, a Police Raid and a Backlash",2019-12-17,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — The deal, worth $670 million, was a triumph for Russia’s tech sector, which is rich in talent but often impoverished by the country’s stumbling efforts to market its world-class skills. The sale to an American company this year of Nginx, a Russian company that developed web server software now used by more than a third of the world’s websites, sent a clear message that Russian programmers can create valuable products for the global market. But that was before Russia’s notoriously capricious and aggressive law-enforcement system got involved. In a series of raids late last week, police officers armed with automatic weapons searched the homes of the company’s Russian founders, Igor Sysoyev and Maxim Konovalov, who were taken in for questioning, and also their company’s Moscow office. Both men now work for F5 Networks, a Seattle-based tech company that purchased Nginx — pronounced “engine-x” — in May. Amid widespread dismay and anger over the raids, a criminal case initiated by the authorities against Nginx has turned one of Russia’s biggest IT success stories into a case study of why the country has so much trouble developing its economy beyond just pulling oil, gas and other natural resources out of the ground. Aleksandr Belov, the head of an internet start-up incubator at the Moscow Physics and Technology Institute, warned that the case “kills technological progress, kills entrepreneurship, kills the already dead venture market and closes the windows to capital for Russian start-ups.” The police action against Nginx came just weeks after armed security officials raided a prestigious Moscow physics institute as part of a criminal case against a private, high-end optics company that, from rented office space at the Lebedev Physics Institute, had developed a small business processing raw glass imported from China and exporting the finished products abroad. Aleksandr Gorbunov, an acerbic and hugely popular social media critic of Russia’s often lawless law-enforcement agencies, condemned the latest raids as another sign of how Russia is governed by “the law of the jungle, where the only way to survive is to constantly demonstrate your strength over the weak in the hope that stronger animals will leave you alone.” The early morning raids on Mr. Sysoyev and Mr. Konovalov were triggered by a criminal case over claims that Nginx does really not own the software acquired by F5 Networks when it bought their Russian company, which was registered in the British Virgin Islands. In a summary of the case in a search warrant, a Ministry of Interior investigator, E.A. Spirenkova, said Nginx’s popular software belonged to Rambler, a Russian internet and media holding company controlled by a state bank and a well-connected billionaire. Both Mr. Sysoyev and Mr. Konovalov worked previously at Rambler, which, according to the investigator, has “exclusive rights” to the software they sold. A criminal conspiracy to steal the software, the investigator said, had defrauded Rambler of 51 million rubles, around $810,000. In the face of the public outcry, Rambler executives disowned the criminal case. Writing on Facebook, Igor Ashmanov, Rambler’s former chief executive, dismissed the claims of theft as “frivolous” and “not based on anything at all,” a view echoed by many others in Russia’s IT sector. A group of former Rambler employees issued a statement saying they were “ashamed” of their former employer, accusing it of “intimidating business and trying to increase its capitalization by commandeering and misappropriating.” Assailed on social media and in the Russian press as a bullying behemoth bent on grabbing a share of the money paid by the American company, Rambler issued a statement on Monday insisting that it had played no role in initiating the criminal case against Nginx and wanted it stopped.  Disputes over intellectual property are a regular feature of the fiercely competitive IT sector around the world, but these are usually adjudicated by courts in civil proceedings. In Russia, such cases quickly escalate into criminal investigations featuring security officers waving guns. Powerful figures in business with connections to the Russian state often use the security forces to extort money or favors from weaker rivals.  Mr. Konovalov, one of the Nginx founders whose Moscow home was raided, denounced the police action in an interview with Meduza, a news portal, as a “typical racket. Simple as that.” He said the raids had been “professional and polite, if you exclude the fact that special forces agents were standing around with automatic weapons.” Contacted by The New York Times, he declined to comment about accusations that he and his partner, Mr. Sysoyev, had stolen Rambler’s intellectual property. Rambler, in a statement issued after an emergency board meeting on Monday, blamed Lynwood Investments, a Cyprus-registered company controlled by billionaire Aleksandr L. Mamut, a major shareholder in Rambler, for the criminal case against Nginx.  Rambler’s board ordered the company’s management to ask the law enforcement authorities to “terminate” the criminal case. Rambler’s chairman, Lev Khasis, said, “It’s natural for tech companies to defend their rights, but these issues should be decided by civil laws.” The decision by Rambler’s board to step away from the case does not automatically end the criminal investigation, but it does indicate that at least some powerful forces in Russian business — including the state-controlled bank Sberbank, which purchased a 46 percent stake in Rambler in August — want to put an end to the predatory practices that have done so much to stymie Russia’s economic development. The Kremlin, too, has tried to distance itself from the ruckus. President Vladimir V. Putin has for years insisted that Russia’s future economic health rests on exploiting its large reserves of scientific and technological talent but has done nothing to rein in law enforcement agencies that keep undermining this goal. Asked about the raids on Nginx’s founders, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said on Monday that the Kremlin was not involved and could not interfere. Russia, he added, “remains attractive for investment.” F5 Networks also distanced itself from the dispute, insisting in a statement that it was “currently not a party” to the criminal investigation unfolding in Moscow.  In a message to customers, it assured them that all of the disputed Nginx software it purchased was “stored on servers outside of Russia” and that “no other products are developed within Russia.” Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.']",A case linked to a $670 million acquisition shows that there may be a limit to the authorities’ abuse of law enforcement to advance corrupt business interests.
Malta Murder Investigation Closes In on ‘Mafia State’,2019-12-19,By Andrew Higgins,"['VALLETTA, Malta — Soon after a car bomb killed Malta’s best-known journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, two years ago, the prime minister’s chief of staff had a hot tip for reporters covering the murder: It was a mafia hit by an Italian fuel-smuggling racket. More than two years later, Keith Schembri, the official who promoted that bogus story, is now himself under a cloud of suspicion in the murder plot, along with a multimillionaire businessman, Yorgen Fenech, 38, a close friend who was arrested at sea while trying to flee on his yacht. Slowed down for months by phony leads and obstruction by the government, which tipped off suspects about imminent arrests, the investigation into Ms. Caruana Galizia’s murder suddenly picked up speed late last month after a self-confessed middleman in the murder plot, fearing for his life, started talking. The inquiry is now closing in on what the murdered journalist’s family and many others see as the real culprit: not Italian Mafiosi but what many here call Malta’s own “mafia state.” A mounting public uproar forced the resignation late last month of Mr. Schembri, just before he was taken in, briefly, for questioning by murder investigators. Two others ministers also stepped down. After days of protests in the capital, Valletta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, then announced  that he was quitting, too, but would not leave office until January, a delay that triggered yet more protests. A key witness in the case, Melvin Theuma, granted immunity in return for his testimony, said in a court appearance last week that Mr. Fenech, the businessman, had given him 150,000 euros, around $165,000, to hire the contract killers who carried out the murder. He also said that, just days after recruiting the three assassins, who were arrested in December 2017, he had been summoned to meet Mr. Schembri and given a no-show government job. Testifying in court on Wednesday as a witness, Mr. Schembri denied initiating the meeting and said Mr. Theuma had been sent to him about a possible job. There was nothing suspicious in this, he added, since “there are many people like Melvin Theuma who came to me, five or six every day” in search of work. Insisting he had nothing to do with the murder plot, he also denied leaking information about the investigation to suspects. The spectacle of a member state of the European Union veering so far from the rule of law — especially one whose prime minister, Mr. Muscat, was once seen as a possible candidate to take over the presidency of the bloc — has stirred dismay and outrage across Europe. “I never knew growing up in a small village in Africa that I would ever see what I see here in a member of the European Union,” said Assita Kanko, an elected member of the European Parliament from Belgium who was raised in Burkina Faso and visited Malta recently as part of a delegation of alarmed European legislators.  Sophia in ’t Veld, the Dutch leader of the delegation, said calling Malta a “mafia state” was “going too far,” but added that she had “very grave concerns” about the erosion of the rule of law and the integrity of Malta’s institutions.  Mr. Muscat, under growing pressure to leave office immediately, told the visiting legislators that he felt “betrayed” by his former chief of staff, Mr. Schembri, whom he had for years defended against persistent corruption allegations. He has rejected accusations that the rot extended throughout his government, telling the nation in a televised address that “our institutions are strong and they function.” A former British colony tugged for centuries between cultural influences from Europe and North Africa, the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, which joined the European Union as its smallest member in 2004, is in some ways a victim of its own success. Surging economic growth, particularly in recent years, when the economy grew by more than 6 percent a year, has been accompanied by a flood of foreign money into property, banking, gambling and other ventures, and also into the purchase of Maltese passports, which raised hundreds of millions of euros.  This all opened mouthwatering vistas for corrupt officials, unrestrained by rickety law enforcement and judicial systems that could not keep pace and are largely beholden to the prime minister, who controls all key appointments. In Malta, said Simon Busuttil, a former opposition leader and friend of the dead journalist, “there has always been some corruption. But now it is from the top down.” A deeply polarized political system has reinforced a sense of impunity at the top, with Mr. Muscat enjoying the support of a loyal Labour Party base that, fed fake social media reports about Ms. Caruana Galizia’s views — a favorite lie is that she wanted all their children to die of cancer — often believes that she was to blame for her own murder.  As evidence mounts of potential misdeeds by the prime minister’s staff, even some longtime Labour supporters are coming around to the view that corrupt ties between business and politics and the culture of impunity they engendered are what killed the journalist. “They had this feeling of omnipotence, and thought they could get away with anything,” said Saviour Balzan, the owner and managing editor of Malta Today, and a recipient of Mr. Schembri’s bum tip about Italian fuel smugglers.  Just how high the murder plot might reach became clear late last month when Mr. Fenech, the business magnate who has known Mr. Schembri since childhood, was arraigned in court in Valletta and charged with complicity in murder and two other crimes relating to the murder. He pleaded not guilty. After attending the arraignment and sitting just behind the man accused of paying for the murder of his mother, Matthew Caruana Galizia, the dead journalist’s oldest son, said he had “wanted to grab his head and bash it into the wooden bench.” But, he added, more important now was to get charges brought against Mr. Schembri and others in the government who his family and others accuse of involvement in the murder, either in orchestrating it or covering it up. Mr. Fenech has himself testified in court that Mr. Schembri was involved in the cover-up. Speaking briefly to The New York Times during a break in the court proceedings, Mr. Fenech said the prosecution case casting him as the sole mastermind of the murder plot “is all a cover-up.” Standing impassively before the judge in a musty courtroom hung with a crucifix, Mr. Fenech wore a tailored business suit, gray tie and pressed white shirt. He looked every inch the successful businessman, which is what he was until early in the morning of Nov. 20, when the Maltese armed forces intercepted his yacht as he tried to escape after receiving a tip-off from Mr. Schembri. He told a court on Thursday that Mr. Schembri had regularly passed on confidential information “in real time” from investigators, alerting him that he was a prime suspect, that his phone was being tapped and that the three suspected hit men were about to be arrested. Mr. Schembri denied this in court on Wednesday. He acknowledged speaking with Mr. Fenech by phone the night before the businessman tried to escape by yacht but insisted that he had urged him not to leave and did not know that his friend was about to be arrested. The yacht on which he tried to flee had sailed from Portomaso, a marina, casino and property development built by Mr. Fenech’s family conglomerate, Tumas Group, which holds the franchise to Malta’s Hilton Hotel and owns a string of other assets, including casinos and a stake in the country’s main electricity generator, Electrogas. Unlike Mr. Fenech, whom Ms. Caruana Galizia wrote about just once, the electricity company featured regularly in her writings, particularly after it received a loan guarantee from the government of 360 million euros, about $400 million, soon after Mr. Muscat took office in 2012 and struck a curiously expensive gas supply deal with Azerbaijan, a part owner of the power plant. (Neither the Tumas Group nor Electrogas has been implicated in the murder.) Writing in her hugely popular blog, Running Commentary, a mix of serious reporting and scabrous personal attacks, she reported in 2016 that Mr. Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, the energy minister at the time of the loan guarantee, secretly owned offshore companies. These offshore companies, according to documents leaked as part of a vast trove of confidential material known as the Panama Papers, were set up to receive 2 million euros a year, or $2.25 million, from a mysterious firm called 17 Black, which turned out to be owned by Mr. Fenech. As a pupil in the early 1990s at St. Edward’s College, then Malta’s most expensive private school, the young Mr. Fenech wrote an essay for the school magazine in which he said he would like to grow up to be like Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian tycoon who was then a rising star in the art of mixing business and politics. How closely they had become entwined in Malta was evident from the court testimony of Mr. Theuma, Mr. Fenech’s former driver and self-confessed middleman in the murder plot. He told the court that the businessman first asked him to find contract killers in early 2017, but then ordered him to put the murder on hold until after a June general election. After it became clear that Mr. Muscat’s party had won re-election, he said that Mr. Fenech told him: “Tell them to get on with it. I want Daphne dead.” Mr. Theuma said the businessman wanted the journalist killed to prevent her from publishing unspecified information about his uncle, Raymond Fenech, the chief executive of Tumas Group. Asked at a public inquiry recently whether the murder of his wife was avoidable, her widower, Peter Caruana Galizia, said: “Yes. Without the corruption, she would still be alive.”']",Evidence is mounting that the bomb plot that killed the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia reached deep into the government and business elite.
Persian Gulf Standoff Starts to Thaw on the Soccer Field,2019-12-19,By Declan Walsh,"['DOHA, Qatar — To make it to the big game, the Saudi soccer fan resorted to unusual measures. He first flew to Kuwait, where he told his parents he was going on vacation. Then he boarded a plane to Qatar, the site of a major soccer tournament this week. Officially, it was a forbidden journey: for over two years Saudi Arabia has led a strict diplomatic and trade embargo of Qatar, and its citizens are barred from traveling there. But the subterfuge and secrecy employed by the fan, Majed al-Qahtani, 29, turned out to be unnecessary. The bitter standoff in the Persian Gulf has softened in recent weeks amid a sudden flurry of peace talks between Saudi and Qatari leaders. Arriving in Qatar, Mr. al-Qahtani found hundreds of other Saudi soccer fans, all mingling easily with their Qatari hosts, apparently with a wink and nod from their government — the most visible sign yet of a recent thaw between the oil-rich countries. “The conflict is an issue between governments,” he said, sitting in the lobby of the ornate hotel where his sports heroes were staying. “Believe me, ordinary people have no issues with each other. We are brothers.” Qatari and Saudi officials have started talks to end the embargo, which has blocked Qatar’s planes from flying over its Gulf neighbors and shut its only land border, with Saudi Arabia.  Last weekend President Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, attended a major conference in Doha, Qatar’s capital, as did the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who urged the two sides to mend fences. Among Gulf experts and western officials, speculation is rife about possible concessions such as easing airspace restrictions on Qatar, or even reopening the border with Saudi Arabia. All sides stress that the talks are tentative, and there are signs that the Saudis’ main ally, the United Arab Emirates, is far less receptive to softening its stance. Still, the talks are the most promising opening yet, and soccer has already rushed into the breach. “We’re hoping this will end soon, maybe in a couple of months,” said Saud Khalid, a 25-year-old Saudi paramedic, who was in the stands of Khalifa International Stadium in Doha on Tuesday night. “The atmosphere in both countries is becoming more optimistic.” Behind him, another Saudi fan jumped to his feet and held aloft a Saudi flag — an unthinkable sight in Qatar only last summer. Soccer and diplomacy are closely intertwined in the Gulf, where the world’s most popular sport has become a conduit for the ambitions, political differences and intrigues of jousting Gulf rulers. Just as the leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have splurged vast sums on the world’s most expensive paintings or on building elegant museums, so has soccer become the focus of a kind of sports arms race. In January 2018, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, permitted women to attend soccer matches, the first concrete step in a series of reforms aimed at loosening the kingdom’s ultraconservative laws and social codes, such as allowing women to drive and permitting cinemas to open.  Political passions sometimes spilled onto the field. When Qatar played the United Arab Emirates in the Asian Cup last January, Emirati fans flung their shoes at celebrating Qatari players after they scored a goal. When Qatar thrashed North Korea 6-0 in another match, only one supporter in the near-empty stadium was wearing Qatar’s colors: a woman from South Korea. Prince Mohammed has not hesitated to use soccer as a tool to advance his regional rivalries. In September, the world soccer body, FIFA, said it had proof that a Saudi company had been pirating the television stream of beIN Sports, a Qatari state-owned company that has spent hundreds of millions of dollars for the exclusive TV rights to major soccer matches in the Middle East. The furor over the pirate Saudi service, known as beoutQ, peaked in 2018 when it stole and broadcast the World Cup across the Middle East, costing the Qatari company a fortune in lost revenues. When FIFA tried to sue beoutQ in the Saudi courts, it could not find a Saudi lawyer willing to represent it. The competition in Qatar this week, the Club World Cup, is a dry-run of sorts for Qatar’s effort to host the World Cup in 2022 — an immense coup for a tiny country of 300,000 citizens, and one which demonstrates its ambition to use its vast gas wealth to project its image on the global stage. Inevitably, the 2022 competition was sucked into the confrontation between Qatar and its larger neighbors. After the regional crisis erupted in 2017, with Qatar’s foes accusing it of financing terrorism and interfering in their domestic affairs, charges Qatar denies, Emirati ministers called on FIFA to strip Qatar of the World Cup. In London, well-financed lobbying efforts with links to Qatar’s rivals started a campaign that amplified concerns over workers’ rights in Qatar, as well as accusations that Qatari officials paid extravagant bribes in order to win the right to host the World Cup. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates hired a former National Security Agency analyst to hack the computers of Qatari and FIFA officials in the hope of finding damaging information about Qatar’s World Cup bid, Reuters reported last week. The hacker tried to lure targets, including the head of Qatar’s World Cup coordination body, with a phishing scam featuring attractive “World Cup girls,” Reuters said. In recent months, as tensions have begun to ease between Qatar and its neighbors, the change has also been seen on the soccer field. The thaw started in October when, at the 11th hour, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Bahrain allowed their soccer teams to travel to Qatar to play in the Arabian Gulf Cup. When Saudi Arabia beat Qatar 1-0, no shoes were thrown. When Bahrain won the competition, the emir of Qatar presented the team with the cup. After a top Qatari player took a Saudi player for a friendly car ride, a video of the ride went viral. When he slipped into Qatar last weekend, Mr. al-Qahtani and his friend Khaled al-Anqari mingled in Souk Wakif, a popular district in central Doha with upmarket cafes, falcon dealers and buildings festooned with giant pictures of the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. They befriended a 19-year-old Qatari, Tamim al-Marri, who invited them for coffee and dates, and then brought them to his home for a meal. “They are our cousins and our brothers,” said Mr. al-Marri, a military trainee. Such warm encounters are a stark contrast with the early months of the crisis, when Qataris and Saudis insulted each other using harsh language on social media. Now, though, some say they are turning away from social media feeds that are often controlled by their own governments. “I think social media is controlled by the intelligence,” Mr. al-Qahtani said. “Now you see, the language is changing. It has become softer.” While their presence in Qatar was still technically illegal, the two young Saudis were not worried about repercussions at home. If challenged about the trip, Mr. al-Anqari said, “I could say that I went there to support my team Al Hilal in the World Cup.” That evening, they attended the semifinal match between Al Hilal and a Brazilian team, Flamengo. On the way there, a crowd of boisterous Brazilian fans in Doha’s new metro ribbed the Saudis, at one point picking up Mr. al-Qahtani and hoisting him on their shoulders. Al Hilal lost. The young Saudis said they would stay in Doha through the tournament final on Saturday. Once they get home, they said, they’ll tell their families where they have really been.']","For more than two years, Saudi Arabia and its allies have waged an economic war against Qatar. But some things are more important than politics."
"Boris Johnson Has a Mandate. Now, What Will He Do With It?",2019-12-17,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Five days after British voters handed Prime Minister Boris Johnson the greatest political mandate of any Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher, the country is still arguing over what he’s going to do with that power. Even after a campaign that Mr. Johnson made almost exclusively about Brexit, nobody knows what kind of relationship Mr. Johnson truly wants with the European Union, and so the theories abound. “A softer Brexit may well now happen,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party, he said, rode to victory on working-class voters, who will now pressure him to negotiate a closer long-term trading relationship with the European Union. Not so fast, said Simon Fraser, a former head of the British diplomatic service. Mr. Johnson’s victory, he said, signified the power of fast, simple answers, and the fastest, simplest one is to make a clean break from Europe. “I’m not at all convinced he wants to do a softer Brexit,” Mr. Fraser said. The debate has raged in newspaper columns, TV appearances and on social media — and it shows no sign of abating. It speaks to an election that was at once historically consequential and strangely inconclusive. On Tuesday, those who argue that Mr. Johnson will pursue a hard Brexit — a divorce without close ties — seized on the prime minister’s plans for legislation that would bar Britain from extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. That was proof, they said, that he was intent on breaking with the European Union, come what may. The pound, which soared after the election on hopes of an end to the uncertainty, fell back on fears that Britain could fail to come to terms with the European Union by the end of the transition period — triggering a so-called “no deal Brexit” that experts warn would be economically disastrous. But Mr. Travers interpreted the proposed law the other way. Why would Mr. Johnson rule out an extension to the trade negotiations, he said, unless his plan was for London and Brussels to end up in close alignment? The fierce postelection debate attests, first, to the fickleness and ideological elasticity of Mr. Johnson, who almost came out against Brexit in 2016 before throwing himself into the Leave campaign. It also speaks to the utter lack of substantive debate about the shape of Brexit during the campaign. Mr. Johnson never tired of promising to “get Brexit done,” but he steered clear of any explanation of how he would do it, or the trade-offs involved. The few times he did get into the details, he was often wrong. He erroneously claimed, for example, that companies shipping goods from Northern Ireland to a post-Brexit Britain would not have to fill out any additional customs paperwork, when the terms of his withdrawal agreement with the European Union will clearly require it. Not getting drawn into the details of Brexit was a deliberate strategy that emerged after some internal debate, said Brett O’Donnell, a Republican political consultant who advised the Conservatives during the campaign. “There was an instinct to relitigate the arguments on Brexit,” said Mr. O’Donnell, who prepared both George W. Bush and Mitt Romney for their presidential debates and coached Mr. Johnson when he led the Leave campaign in 2016. But Mr. O’Donnell and other senior advisers, including Mr. Johnson’s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, argued that, “It was not about relitigating the arguments over Brexit but channeling people’s frustration that it had not been done yet,” Mr. O’Donnell said. “The Brexit message is the gateway to every other message,” he added. It helped that the Labour Party’s position on Brexit was hopelessly muddled. In seeking to shift the debate to kitchen-table issues like health care or education, the party avoided the subject almost altogether. So, in an election ostensibly about Brexit, voters were never asked to confront to the essential question raised by Britain’s departure: What kind of trading relationship does Britain want with its largest neighbor?  But there is also little indication that the public ever wanted to have that debate. “It’s worth remembering just how weird Brexit is,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College in London. “It is an issue that has dominated our politics like no other for more than three years, and yet there is such fatigue with it.” “The British people are not aware of the huge differences in various Brexit models,” he continued. “They just want the politicians to sort it out.” With so little settled, Britain’s political establishment is casting about for clues in other places. The people Mr. Johnson chooses for his new Cabinet early next year might give a hint of intentions, Professor Menon said. If he replaces current ministers who are hard-line Brexiteers, like Priti Patel, the home secretary, or Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, that may suggest he wants closer relations with the European Union. Analysts are also looking at particular parts of the country where pressure on Mr. Johnson could mount from inside his own party.  In Stoke-on-Trent, for example, Conservatives now hold all three Parliamentary seats. The region is heavily dependent on ceramics and, hence, on trade with Europe. Those voters are likely to be hurt by a Brexit that is too hard, leaving Britain with few ties to the bloc. “The logic of the Conservative Party’s new base means that at least manufacturing needs to be protected as much as possible,” said Mr. Travers, the London School of Economics professor. “That gives Boris Johnson less room for a hard deal.” Mr. Johnson himself has given few clues since his victory. He said he recognized that the Conservative Party needed to serve working-class voters in the Midlands and the North, who had historically voted for the Labour Party but switched to the Tories out of frustration with the failure to complete Brexit. But he did not say whether the interests of those voters would have any effect on how he negotiated with the European Union — or, for that matter, how he planned to negotiate with the bloc at all. The government’s strategy, some said, will be to relegate the trade negotiations to technical groups, while Mr. Johnson focuses on more popular, headline-grabbing initiatives like funding the National Health Services or hiring more police officers. On Tuesday, as he spoke to his cabinet and later to Parliament, Mr. Johnson again stuck to generalities and a message of unity. “We must recognize that people lent us their votes at this election,” the prime minister said. “It was a seismic election, but we need to repay their trust and work 24 hours a day, work flat out to deliver on it.” “You ain’t seen nothing yet, folks,” Mr. Johnson promised, without giving a hint of what he had in mind.']","After a consequential but strangely inconclusive election, the prime minister still has not said what he means by Brexit."
Husband in Taliban Hostage Couple Acquitted of Assaulting Wife,2019-12-19,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — Joshua Boyle, a Canadian held hostage with his American wife in Afghanistan for five years, was cleared on Thursday of charges that he repeatedly abused and assaulted her after their rescue. In the three hours it took Justice Peter K. Doody of the Ontario Court of Justice to dismiss 19 charges against Mr. Boyle, which included sexual assault, the judge repeatedly said that he did not believe the testimony of either Mr. Boyle or the woman, Caitlan Coleman, who is no longer his wife.  While Justice Doody said the evidence showed that Mr. Boyle had been “cruel, demeaning and controlling” of Ms. Coleman, the judge found her to be a generally unreliable witness partly because of her testimony that she had memory problems and, as she testified, “difficulty seeing reality quite right.” Ms. Coleman said at the trial that her memory issues were caused by mental health problems she began to suffer over a decade ago. “Unless her evidence is independently confirmed, I do not believe it, just as I do not believe Mr. Boyle,” the judge told an Ottawa courtroom. Ian Carter, a lawyer who represents Ms. Coleman, said his client was “devastated” by the ruling. “This case is an example of the challenges that a complainant faces coming forward with allegations of sexual assault or domestic violence,” he told reporters. The couple were seized by the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, in 2012 while backpacking in Wardak Province, a Taliban stronghold near Kabul. Five years later they were rescued, along with their three children who were born in captivity, in a daring raid by Pakistani troops. Because the criminal case only involved the first few weeks after the couple returned to Canada, it shed relatively little new light on why Mr. Boyle and Ms. Coleman decided to enter an unstable region in Afghanistan for a hiking trip. Ms. Coleman, who is originally from Stewartstown, Penn., was pregnant at the time of their capture. At the trial, Mr. Boyle faced 18 charges including sexual assault, forceable confinement, assault, assault with a weapon, administering a drug and public mischief. There was also one charge of assault of a person who cannot be identified by a court order.  Mr. Boyle denied the charges, saying they never happened. Ms. Coleman described a series of assaults, some of which she said had been punishments for not following Mr. Boyle’s orders once they were back in Canada.  Mr. Boyle and Ms. Coleman both testified that he prepared “a list of rules” for her that included weight-loss goals, planning “interesting sex minimum twice a week” and only taking cold showers. “You must ask for chastising every time you think you have failed,” Mr. Boyle wrote on his list, which was presented at trial. Ms. Coleman moved to the United States in 2018 and now lives with the couple’s four children.  The case was the first to be tried under a new law in Canada that allows sexual assault victims to be represented by a lawyer at the trial. But Dawn Moore, a professor of law and legal studies at Carleton University in Ottawa, said that it did not change the fact that “sexual assault cases almost always come down to, ‘He said, she said.’”  Professor Moore said that Justice Doody’s decision would further discourage victims from going to the police.  Lawrence Greenspon, Mr. Boyle’s lawyer, sharply rejected suggestions that the verdict would discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward. “It doesn’t send any kind of a message, in my view, other than when you come to court, tell the truth,” he said after Mr. Boyle walked away from reporters without comment. “And if you don’t tell the truth, then you may not be believed.” Mr. Greenspon said Mr. Boyle would return to court to try to gain access to his children and ultimately custody. Mr. Boyle has never seen their fourth child, who was born after his arrest two years ago. “This is not a credibility contest,” Mr. Greenspon said. “Had it been a credibility contest, I think it was a tie — they both lost.”']","Saying neither Joshua Boyle nor Caitlin Coleman, who were held captive for five years in Afghanistan, were credible, a judge dismissed all charges."
Nurses in Northern Ireland Strike Amid Growing Health Care Crisis,2019-12-18,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — Medical appointments were canceled, hospital units shut down and some ambulance responses were delayed in Northern Ireland on Wednesday, when thousands of nurses staged short strikes in a long-running dispute over pay and patient safety. About 9,000 nurses represented by the Royal College of Nursing, a labor union, left their jobs for 12 hours — the first walkout in the group’s 103-year history. About 6,000 nurses belonging to Unison, a public employee union, joined the protest, and were planning to stay away for a full day. The nurses are demanding that the government-run health care system raise their pay to equal their counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom, and hire more nurses to address inadequate staffing that they say creates unsafe conditions. “With around 2,800 vacant nursing posts in the Health Service Care, record levels of money being spent on agency staff to plug gaps and nurses’ pay sliding further and further behind the rest of the U.K., our members have had enough,” said Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursing. “The concerns of nurses were raised again and again over a number of years, but this has continued to fall on deaf ears,” she added. Northern Ireland’s health care services are on the brink of collapse because of chronic underfunding that has gone unresolved for years. While the health system across Britain is under strain, the problems in Northern Ireland are particularly acute because, for almost three years, there has not been a functioning government in Belfast to make policy decisions, including pay raises for the public sector workers. Critical services like cancer care, mental health and emergency care are struggling to cope, while waiting lists have expanded to record levels. Currently, 30,000 people are waiting to see a senior physician and many people face yearslong waits for elective procedures like hip and knee replacements. The region has also been confronting a suicide crisis, caused by poverty, a lack of mental health resources, a recent uptick in paramilitary violence and post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans of Northern Ireland’s three-decade-long guerrilla war. Only about 5 percent of Northern Ireland’s health budget is spent on mental health, compared to 13 percent in England. “The stark reality is that the Northern Ireland health service is falling behind the rest of the U.K.,” said Simon Hoare, the chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Parliament. “An approach to funding that simply keeps things ticking over, and an absence of overarching strategy in key areas, has left services at the breaking point and this situation must end as soon as possible.” The committee urged the central government in London to intervene, should Northern Ireland’s power vacuum continue.  Nurses in Northern Ireland earn up to $5,000 a year less than their counterparts in England and Wales, according to the Royal College of Nursing, which says that many nurses are now thinking of leaving the profession because of the increased pressures caused by staffing shortages. A day before Wednesday’s job action, leaders from Northern Ireland’s five main parties met with David Sterling, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, who has been forced to manage daily affairs in the absence of local government ministers. They voiced their collective support for the restoration of pay parity for nurses, the BBC reported. Britain’s nursing unions agreed last year to a three-year, 6.5 percent pay raise, but it could not be applied in Northern Ireland because of the lack of a functioning government there. Marie Kelly, a trainee nurse who participated in a demonstration in Belfast on Wednesday morning, said that nurses did not want to put patients at risk. But they had to do something, she said, because without any action the problems would only get worse. “If nothing is done, patients will face much bigger life-threatening risks,” she said in a telephone interview. “This is a real emergency. We were left with no choice.”']","About 15,000 nurses walked out Wednesday, demanding pay parity with the rest of Britain, and more staffing to save a health system they say is endangering patient safety."
McDonald’s Closes Temporarily in Peru After Death of Teens,2019-12-17,By Julie Turkewitz,"['BOGOTÁ — They were two teenagers — once in love, now just friends — working the overnight shift at a McDonald’s in Lima, Peru, when they were electrocuted by a loose cable over the weekend. The deaths of Alexandra Porras Inga and Gabriel Campos Zapata inside a popular McDonald’s have shaken Peru, a nation already mired in a debate about how to tackle precarious labor conditions, particularly at the large companies that have aided Peru’s supercharged growth. And they come as McDonald’s faces increased scrutiny over treatment of workers around the world. In an interview on Monday, the mother of Ms. Porras Inga, Johana Inga Argote, 38, said that she last saw her daughter on Friday, after mass. On Sunday morning, Ms. Inga Argote received a call from a McDonald’s employee. “Ma’am, there’s been an accident,” the employee told her, she said. “Your daughter is dead.” When she hung up, she said, she began to scream. On Monday, Arcos Dorados, the company that runs McDonald’s in Peru, announced a two-day mourning period in which it would close all its restaurants in the country. “We share the sorrow and extreme pain of the affected families,” the company wrote in a statement, adding that it was cooperating fully with authorities to uncover what had happened.  McDonald’s, based in Chicago, said that safety was a “global priority” and that it was examining the matter with Arcos Dorados. Police have opened an investigation into the deaths. The restaurant where the teenagers died is located in Pueblo Libre, a middle-class district in Peru’s capital. It is owned by Arcos Dorados, a publicly-traded company that holds the exclusive right to operate McDonald’s franchises in at least 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The Pueblo Libre restaurant is open 24 hours on the weekends. Arcos Dorados has expanded precipitously in the region in recent years, and has more than 90,000 employees at more than 2,000 restaurants.  It has focused on hiring young people, advertising its ability to provide them with their first job and to have “transformative social impact” in Latin America. The company is led by Woods Staton, a Colombian-born businessman called “El hombre Big Mac” by some Colombian press. He has ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world.  Ms. Porras Inga, 18, aspired to be a lawyer and judge. She began working at McDonald’s about three months ago in an effort to pitch in with bills at home, according to her family. She was her mother’s only daughter. She met Mr. Campos Zapata in school, and they had dated for a time, her family said. Her mother said that after receiving news of her daughter’s death, she rushed to the locale, where, from afar, she could see wet floors, loose cables and her daughter’s body. The teenager did not appear to be wearing boots, gloves or other safety equipment, she said. She urged McDonald’s to make sure its employees, particularly young ones with little work experience, “receive what they need to stay safe.""  “Don’t let them die,” she said. “Take care of them.” Ms. Porras Inga’s family believes she was washing the floor when she hit a loose wire.  In Peru, the deaths have quickly become part of a larger conversation about workplace conditions.  Peru has seen tremendous, albeit unequal, growth in the last decade, and many in the nation of more than 30 million have clamored to make it into the nation’s expanding middle class.  Jobs in the informal sector remain the most readily available — meaning that work at global franchises, often at companies in new shopping malls, can feel like a shiny, stable road to a better future.  But critics say that the appeal of these jobs has left workers, particularly young workers, open to exploitation. In 2016, a fire in a cinema at a mall called Larcomar, owned by a Chilean company, killed four workers who were trapped inside. Some were found just feet from blocked exits.  More recently, a worker was killed by an explosion at a mall called Jockey Plaza, and a young man arriving for a job interview was run over by a truck at a shopping center called Real Plaza Salaverry. The deaths this weekend at McDonald’s led many young Peruvians to social media, where they shared their own stories of dangerous conditions at companies across the country. On Monday, Peru’s workplace safety department, the Superintendencia Nacional de Fiscalización Laboral, said it had begun an investigation into conditions at the restaurant, and that the fast food chain could face its highest fine — up to 189,000 soles, or about $56,000 — if violations were found. But some said the country is not doing enough to ensure safe working conditions. Indira Huilca, a former congresswoman who has made labor a priority, said the country has concentrated on attracting private investment while neglecting worker safety.  Many politicians see policies that promote inspections and fines as obstacles to investment, she said. As a result, she added, “everyone knows” that many Peruvians, and in particular young people, work in dangerous conditions. McDonald’s faces heightened scrutiny for labor conditions around the world.  In recent years McDonald’s and its franchises have been hit with dozens of sexual harassment complaints, including a new lawsuit that accuses the company of “pervasive problems of sexual harassment,” in the United States.  Workers have also begun striking in cities around the globe, calling for better wages. And in November, the company agreed to pay $26 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the chain of underpaying United States workers at corporate-owned restaurants in California. The suit involved 38,000 employees.

"Amid Chaos of Daily Commutes, Strikers and Macron Compete for the Commuters",2019-12-17,By Adam Nossiter and Mélissa Godin,"['PARIS — It was 5:50 in the afternoon in the Charles de Gaulle station on the RER A, the train that penetrates the suburbs of Paris. The crowd was already five deep. Only a narrow passageway remained on the platform. “Yeah, yeah, they’re coming very slowly,” a woman murmured into her cellphone. A train finally entered. The faces were grim, anxious or resigned. The crowd surged forward but hope quickly dissipated: The train was already full. Only the lucky few at the front squeezed in. The luck was relative. A passenger looked heavenward as the doors closed tightly on her, her face squeezed against the glass. There wasn’t an inch to spare. Thirteen days into the strike that has upended life in France, this was rush hour in the heart of Paris: few trains and too many passengers. Commuters awake early, return late, walk for miles to their jobs, get stuck in monstrous traffic jams that have turned Paris streets into impenetrable traps, or bicycle to work in bike lanes that are now anarchic free-for-alls. Bike and scooter accidents are up 40 percent since the start of the strike. “This is just abusive,” said Jennifer Salles, 23, who had been waiting 25 minutes for her chance at a train on the RER A platform. “I understand their demands, but this is all a big pain for us,” said Ms. Salles, a trainee in a corporate-nursery program. “I think most people are fed up.” Just how fed up is the question before France. The crowds, the delays, the interminable gridlock are more than an inconvenience. They are part of a tug of war for public support between the strikers who want to preserve the most sacred French benefit of all — a cozy but complex pension system — and a government determined to overhaul it. Caught in the middle are France’s frazzled commuters, whose endurance — the strength of their fraying nerves — may ultimately determine who wins.  The government is banking that anger at the strikers for making life miserable will tip the scales of public opinion in its favor. So far that is not happening.  Public support for the strike runs at 62 percent in a poll published Tuesday by Harris Interactive, a number that increased since the beginning of the protests.  With some 615,000 in the streets across France on Tuesday, according to the government, it was the biggest demonstration since the first nationwide protest on Dec. 5. The continuing strength of the mobilization was not good news for the government of President Emmanuel Macron. And precedent doesn’t favor the government either — in 1995, reforms were withdrawn after three weeks of publicly supported strikes. Yet for now, no end is in sight. Most unions have brushed aside pleas for a Christmas “truce,” and the government signaled on Tuesday that it had no intention of backing down. “On this project my determination is total,” Prime Minister Édouard Philippe told the French Parliament on Tuesday. “I say it calmly: It is total.”  With the ratio of active workers to retirees at only 1.7 to 1, compared to 4 to 1 in 1960, the current system is simply unaffordable, the government says. The 70-year-old pensions system, officials say, is heading for big deficits and is unfair to some, and too fair to others.  It features official retirement at 62, and 52 for train drivers, pensions based on the best 25 years in the private sector and the last six months of salary in the public.  The government wants to combine France’s current byzantine system, in which many professions have their own retirement schemes, into one state-managed plan, and to nudge the retirement age up by two years. The special pension regimes had to go, Mr. Philippe said.  But the numbers and the warnings don’t mean much to a public used to the state’s generosity, even as the impact of the strikes mounts.  In central Paris, business in shops and restaurants has fallen over 40 percent. “Business is down. There are fewer customers, even tourists,” said Guénolé Aubert, who runs a pharmacy at the Place de Clichy, normally one of the busiest spots in Paris. But while the shopping crowds were thin, elsewhere in the city on Tuesday the streets were thick with demonstrators from every profession and activity: employees at the Louvre, sewer workers, train drivers, lawyers, students, teachers, judges, doctors, nurses, and prison guards. “Musicians and dancers with the workers,” read one banner; “Girls just wanna have a good salary, a good career, a good retirement,” read another. “Make Our Retirements Great Again,” read a third.  All had come out to express their fury at the government for daring to fix what many believe is not broken. While costly, the current pension regime guarantees the French an unequaled level of security in retirement with one of the lowest old-age poverty rates among countries tracked by the O.E.C.D.  Since the strike began on Dec. 5, centrist writers and analysts in France have again marveled at their compatriots’ passion for retirement, and the apparent lesser place accorded to the world of work.  In the magazine Le Point, the writer Pascal Bruckner criticized “the astonishing spectacle of high school students demonstrating for their pensions.”  But previous government efforts to change the pension system have elicited similar passions. “They’ve got to pull their plan and work with what we’ve already got,” Philippe Martinez, leader of the hard-left CGT union, leading the strike, told reporters at the head of Tuesday’s march across Paris. On Monday, Mr. Macron suffered a sharp blow when his pensions reform czar, Jean-Paul Delevoye, the reform’s mastermind, was forced to resign over conflicts of interest, a government setback that the unions greeted with glee. The big movement against the government’s pension reform has touched two fundamental aspects of contemporary French life: unease over the future and a dyed-in-the-wool belief that the street is the best place to challenge policy.  “We have to try to change things, and unfortunately, it has to be done by striking and protesting,” said Amelie Devalckeneer, a 33-year-old teacher wearing a symbolic yellow vest, in homage to the protests earlier this year. “It’s the only way we can be heard.” Even in the misery of the RER A platform this week, there was support for the anti-pensions reform movement. “I’m with the strikers. The government has changed the rules in the middle of the game,” said Stephane Castex, who works in a bank’s information technology department. He had just failed to get on an overcrowded train. “I’m putting myself in their place,” said Mr. Castex. “I would fight like this if I was them. They signed a contract, and were given benefits. And now they’re losing those benefits.” Rita Chahine, a freelance fashion designer, hopped on the last suburban train in from the Val d’Europe. She had been stuck at home for two weeks, but couldn’t afford to stay away from work any longer. She was not angry. “I support everything that is going to make the future, the country and the people better,” she said. “But it’s true that we are penalized right now.” Amable Ceciliane, an 18-year-old cashier at the huge Bon Marché department and food store on the Left Bank, had commuted three hours into work in Paris on Tuesday, and was facing the same commute that evening. She supports the strikers. “They’re doing this for us as well. So even if it’s annoying, I still support them.” Still, there are some who are not so sure. Twice the crowds had kept Franck Legrand from boarding on the RER A platform. “You can’t reform France,” said Mr. Legrand, who had already walked from his job in the central Invalides district.  “This is not progress, this movement,” he said. “People can’t take this much longer.” Daphne Angles and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.

‘Why My Baby?’: How Measles Robbed Samoa of Its Young,2019-12-19,By Isabella Kwai and Matthew Abbott,"['UPOLU, Samoa — From the beginning, Nuu Lameko’s baby daughter radiated happiness. She clapped and danced to the songs of praise at church. Often, Ms. Lameko would roll a coconut across the floor of their home to hear her giggle. “Whenever I’m having a bad day, she would have that smile to cheer me up,” Ms. Lameko said.  Late last month, that joy turned to despair. The baby girl, Lemina — called Mina for short — contracted measles as a calamitous epidemic swept the Pacific island nation of Samoa. Days later, Mina, just 10 months old, died in her mother’s arms.  “I don’t really accept it,” Ms. Lameko said. “God, why? Why my baby?” That question has consumed Samoa as the epidemic has killed dozens of young children in the past two months and infected thousands more, leaving virtually no one in this nation of big families and communal living untouched.  When measles arrived on its shores, Samoa was grievously unprepared. The government had left the door to contagion wide open, allowing the vaccination rate to fall to a staggeringly low level and putting thousands of children at risk.  The failure started with government complacency,  compounded by a misguided decision to suspend a vaccination program after a medical scare. And the country’s skepticism about immunization was amplified by both anti-vaccine activists and traditional healers. Samoa is an acute example of how unfounded mistrust of vaccines and gaps in routine health care have led to a resurgence of measles around the world. Outbreaks of measles have hit every region of the planet this year, with the virus emerging in places like the United States where it had once been considered eliminated. Worldwide, reported cases jumped 300 percent in the first three months of 2019, compared with the same period last year.  In Samoa, an independent nation that is part of the same island chain as American Samoa, the government has taken sweeping measures to control the disease’s spread after initial delays in the response to the outbreak.  During a mass vaccination campaign in early December, the fear that had washed over the country was clear. Families hung red flags outside their homes to alert health workers that they needed a shot, with some bearing messages like “Help!” or “I want to live!”  That effort has put Samoa on the cusp of achieving a 95 percent vaccination rate, seen as the threshold for “herd immunity” — effective protection from the spread of the disease. For many, it came too late. Over all, 77 people have died in the epidemic, and at least 5,400 cases of measles have been reported among the population of 200,000, though the numbers are most likely higher.  For weeks, families have been holding burials all over the island nation. Funeral homes, used to handling the elderly, are preparing tiny coffins for the bodies of young children and babies, with many offering their services at no charge.  In the village of Faleasiu, the family of Valisa Talosaga, 2, kissed and caressed her body last week before burying her in front of their home. In Vailele, another village, Timoteo Fuatogi, 29, wiped tears with his shirt as a pastor prayed over the open grave of his baby brother. Then the mourners filled the dirt back in with a bucket.  The family, who are street vendors, had taken the child to traditional healers after he contracted measles from his twin brother. He later died in a hospital.  “We worked hard to buy nappies and baby formula,” Mr. Fuatogi said. “It’s really hard for me.” Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans. One person with it can infect 12 to 18 others. Doctors can treat only the symptoms: fever, cough and a rash. Deaths in babies occur from complications like pneumonia. And for those who survive, measles can leave a lasting mark — the possibility of weakened immune systems and neurological complications later in life. In 2013, 90 percent of infants in Samoa were receiving the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine around the time they turned a year old. But the rate gradually declined in the years that followed. “We’ve been slack on the routine immunization,” said Dr. Take Naseri, the director-general of Samoa’s Ministry of Health. “I think we have been quite complacent.” He added, “We never expected the measles outbreak.” In 2018, the immunization rate bottomed out at about 30 percent, on a par with some of the poorest countries in Africa. That year, the country’s faith in vaccination was shaken after two infants who had received the vaccine died — a tragedy that was later attributed to a medical mistake. Nurses had inadvertently mixed a muscle relaxant into the vaccine instead of sterile water.  “After the incident, every parent feared losing their child,” said Taupau Siimamao, the grandfather of Valisa Talosaga, the 2-year-old in Faleasiu who died from respiratory complications after contracting measles. He said the family had planned to vaccinate his granddaughter before the two babies died.  Amid a public outcry, the government recalled the vaccine nationwide, suspending its measles immunization program for nine months as it conducted an investigation. “I had to reassure the population that the vaccine is safe,” Dr. Naseri said. But the World Health Organization said the decision helped create “a pool of susceptible children under the age of 5 years who are now the most affected” in the current epidemic. Even after the program was restored this April, the ongoing criminal case against the nurses continued to feed doubts about vaccination.  Mr. Siimamao, whose granddaughter died, said he believed that the government should have pushed harder to persuade parents to vaccinate their children after the scare. But he does not fault officials for what followed. “We blame ourselves in part for not taking care of her,” he said.  The scare also provided a new opening for anti-vaccination voices, both from Samoa and abroad. “It allowed the speculation and fear and anti-vax to emerge,” said Penelope Schoeffel, a social anthropologist at the National University of Samoa. This month, the government arrested a Samoan anti-vaccination activist, Edwin Tamasese, who has promoted supposed alternatives to vaccines like vitamins A and C. He has called mass vaccination “the greatest crime against our people by our own people.” Approached outside court last week, Mr. Tamasese declined to comment. Another prominent voice in Samoa against vaccinations is Taylor Winterstein, the Australian wife of a Samoan rugby player. In June, she met in Samoa with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of America’s best-known vaccine opponents.  At that meeting was an employee of the United States Embassy. “The reported meeting amongst individuals known for their anti-vaccine views did include a local staffer of the U.S. embassy, but these meetings were conducted on his own time in his capacity as a private citizen and do not in any way reflect the position of the embassy nor the U.S. government,” the State Department said in a statement. The current epidemic, according to the Ministry of Health, began when a person with measles traveled to Samoa from New Zealand, which is struggling with its own outbreak.  Dr. Naseri, the Samoan health official, acknowledged that there was a delay in the government’s announcement of the outbreak. He said it had to confirm the initial measles case with an Australian lab, which took two weeks. Labs in New Zealand were overwhelmed, he said. “I’m not trying to defend what I did,” Dr. Naseri said, “but I had to say with confidence that we have a measles outbreak.” The government announced that there was a suspected case of measles on Oct. 9, then officially announced the outbreak on Oct. 16. A month later, as the death toll reached 15, it declared a state of emergency, shuttering schools and barring children from public gatherings. On Saturday, the government extended the emergency through Dec. 29.  In early December, the government shut down for two days to carry out a nationwide vaccination push, aided by global groups like the World Health Organization and Unicef. The Samoan Parliament is set to consider legislation that would make vaccinations compulsory to enter school. “I’ve never seen as high a level of political commitment in a country to conduct a measles campaign,” said Dr. David Sniadack, a representative of the Global Immunization Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the epidemic is slowing, it has been hard to contain.  One complication is that some parents first take their children to traditional healers, some of whom use machines purchased from Australia that they claim produce water with immune-protective properties. “People go to traditional healers and present really late, and that’s why we have a lot of critical cases,” said Frances Vulivuli, a doctor with Unicef, adding that many babies had been close to death on arrival. In the hospitals, some of the Samoan staff members have worked every day since the epidemic began, even taking 24-hour shifts.

Woman Wins High-Profile #MeToo Case in Japan Against TV Journalist,2019-12-18,By Motoko Rich and Hisako Ueno,"['TOKYO — A Tokyo court on Wednesday sided with a woman who accused a prominent television journalist of rape, ordering him to pay her damages worth about $30,000 in a ruling that the victim called a milestone in Japan. In the closely watched civil case, the Tokyo District Court ordered Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a former Washington bureau chief of the Tokyo Broadcasting System and a biographer of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, to pay the damages to Shiori Ito, a journalist who has become a feminist icon in Japan for being one of the few women willing to speak out about sexual assault there. Judge Akihiro Suzuki said in his ruling that he found Ms. Ito “highly trustworthy” and accepted her account of being assaulted in Mr. Yamaguchi’s hotel room after he took her to dinner in Tokyo in 2015 to discuss job prospects. The judge said Mr. Yamaguchi had committed “an illegal act” by engaging in sexual intercourse with Ms. Ito without her consent while she was inebriated and unconscious, and continuing even after she awoke and refused him. Ms. Ito had sought damages of about $100,000 after the police had conducted an investigation and decided against arresting Mr. Yamaguchi, and prosecutors had not indicted him on criminal charges. Mr. Yamaguchi had countersued for damages of about $1.2 million, but the court said his claims were “groundless.” Speaking in front of the court building after the judgment, Ms. Ito, who is now working as a freelance journalist, thanked her supporters. “It has been a long time,” she said. “But even little by little, a big change is happening. The scene I am witnessing is completely different from the one I used to see before.” At a news conference following the ruling, Mr. Yamaguchi accused Ms. Ito of “telling lies” and said he would appeal. The judgment, he said, was “not based on objective facts.” The judge’s finding in Ms. Ito’s case was notable in that Japan’s sex crime laws do not mention consent.  In 2018, the police confirmed 1,307 cases of rape in Japan. That figure most likely undercounts the number of assaults: A survey by the central government’s Cabinet Office in 2017 found that close to 60 percent of women who are victims of rape do not report the crime. In her news conference on Wednesday, Ms. Ito said she hoped that Japan’s rape laws would be revised to include consent, making it possible for other victims to pursue criminal charges.  “If non-consensual sexual intercourse is defined as rape in the law,” she said, “the hurdle to prosecute would be much lower.” Ms. Ito added that she wanted to send a message to others who have experienced sexual assault. “I want to tell them, ‘Thank you so much for surviving until today,’” she said. “When you feel better, I hope to take action together.” Makiko Inoue contributed research.']","A Tokyo court ordered damages worth about $30,000 in a ruling that the victim called a milestone in the country."
"Pervez Musharraf, Former Pakistani Leader, Sentenced to Death",2019-12-17,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — After years of delays and disruptions, a special court in Pakistan on Tuesday sentenced the country’s former military dictator, Pervez Musharraf, to death in a treason case.  But the sentence is more symbolic in nature, as Mr. Musharraf is currently in self-imposed exile in Dubai and is unlikely to return to the country. Nevertheless, the sentence marked the first time in the country’s history that a military dictator has been held accountable for his actions while in power.  A three-member special court panel announced that Mr. Musharraf “has been found guilty of Article 6 for violation of the Constitution of Pakistan,” namely, high treason and subverting the Constitution. Two judges decided in favor of the guilty verdict while one disagreed. Mr. Musharraf, 76, was accused of subverting the country’s Constitution in 2007 when he imposed a state of emergency in the country in an attempt to thwart a political opposition movement and also fired much of the judiciary. The movement had greatly weakened Mr. Musharraf, and he resigned in 2008 under a threat of impeachment. The treason case was initiated in 2013 by the government of Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister who has a history of animosity toward the former military ruler. Mr. Musharraf toppled Mr. Sharif’s government in 1999 in a bloodless coup and ruled until 2008.  But as Mr. Musharraf’s fortunes tumbled, Mr. Sharif’s rose; he managed to make a political comeback and returned to power in 2013. Within months, his government announced that it was initiating a treason case against the former military dictator. Mr. Musharraf has denied the charges and insisted that the case against him was a political vendetta. Officials in his political party, All Pakistan Muslim League, said they planned to appeal against the court sentence. Hours after the verdict, the top military commanders met at an emergency session at the General Headquarters of the Pakistani army in Rawalpindi and in a sharply worded statement expressed solidarity with their former chief. The military said that the court decision was received with a “lot of pain and anguish by the rank and file of Pakistan armed forces.” Mr. Musharraf, who held all top military positions, and “fought wars for the country can surely never be a traitor,” the statement read.  The treason case against Mr. Musharraf was groundbreaking in many ways. None of the country’s military dictators had ever before been held accountable for their actions. And Mr. Sharif sought to use the treason case to assert civilian supremacy over the military, a powerful institution in Pakistan. The country’s military, however, balked at the move.  Mr. Musharraf did not appear in the initial proceedings of the treason case, and before one hearing, in 2014, his security convoy was suddenly and mysteriously directed to a military hospital. Mr. Musharraf was then hospitalized as he complained of chest pains, but it was widely believed that the military was protecting its former chief from prosecution. In 2016, Mr. Musharraf was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. He said he would return and face the legal cases, but he failed to do so. Earlier this month, Mr. Musharraf released a video message from a hospital in Dubai where he was undergoing medical treatment and complained of being treated unjustly.  “I have served Pakistan all my life and I am being tried for treason,” a frail and weak looking Mr. Musharraf said. Mr. Musharraf once enjoyed broad support both in Pakistan and abroad, and was considered an important ally of the United States in its effort to root out terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But his popularity dropped sharply in 2007 as he tried to maintain his grip on power and clashed with the country’s judiciary and political opposition. The Deputy South Asia Director of Amnesty International, Omar Waraich, said in a statement that Mr. Musharraf and his government officials must be held accountable but expressed reservations over the death penalty. “No one is above the law,” Mr. Waraich said. But, he added, “the death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment; it metes out vengeance, not justice.”']",The Pakistani court’s sentence is unlikely to be carried out because Mr. Musharraf is no longer in the country.
Philippine Clan Leaders Guilty in Political Massacre of Scores of People,2019-12-19,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — A Philippine court on Thursday found the leaders of a powerful local dynasty guilty in one of the country’s worst political massacres, in which dozens of members of a rival politician’s convoy were ambushed and gunned down more than 10 years ago. Three brothers — Zaldy Ampatuan, Sajid Ampatuan and Andal Ampatuan Jr. — were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the killings of 57 people on Nov. 23, 2009, in the southern province of Maguindanao. Most of the victims were journalists and media workers, and others were supporters and family members of Esmael Mangudadatu, a candidate for governor, on their way to file papers for his candidacy.  “They shot my wife 17 times,” Mr. Mangudadatu, now a member of the Philippine Congress, told journalists in Manila recently, choking back tears. “They shot her on her breasts, her private parts. Such unimaginable cruelty.” Reporters Without Borders called it the biggest massacre of journalists in history. Even for the Philippines, where political murders are commonplace, the scale of the killings was shocking. The volatile Maguindanao area in the southern Philippines was long controlled by the Ampatuan clan, whose leaders investigators say carried out the attack because Mr. Mangudadatu’s candidacy represented a direct challenge to their power. The clan, led by the Ampatuan brothers’ father, Andal Ampatuan Sr., who died in 2015, had built up their political might by aligning with the government, which used Mr. Ampatuan and his large private army as a militia to counter Muslim separatists and militants operating on Mindanao Island, which includes Maguindanao. There had been threats of violence before the massacre. But Mr. Mangudadatu and his supporters were confident that the large number of journalists and media workers in their convoy — 32 in all — would give the rival clan a pause, witnesses testified at the trial. Instead, a militia unit led by Andal Ampatuan Jr., the patriarch’s favorite son, seized the group and forced them at gunpoint to a hilltop, where they were shot and hacked to death, witnesses said. The violence had been planned in advance, witnesses told the court, and the gunmen, backed by corrupt local police officers on their payroll, tried to bury the remains using a government-owned backhoe. The case involved about 100 defendants, most of whom the court acquitted on Thursday. More than 40 people were convicted, 15 of them as accessories to the killings. Fifty-eight people are believed to have died in the massacre, but the body of one of them — Reynaldo Momay, a journalist — was never found, and the defendants were found not guilty of killing him. His daughter, Maria Reynafe Castillo, said she had expected that. “The main perpetrators got life without parole,” she said. “I am happy with that.” Not all of the suspects have been accounted for. Eighty remain at large and are believed to be hiding in the south and likely still working with the clan, officials say. The national police have said they believe that those not in custody might be hiding in areas controlled by armed Muslim militants. The suspects who are still at large remain a continued source of worry. Earlier this month, a man who had testified for the prosecution, Basit Taguigaya, was killed in an ambush.  “He was supposed to join me in Manila for the promulgation of the Maguindanao massacre case,” Mr. Mangudadatu told reporters recently. “No one has yet been arrested. Are the lives of those who testified also in danger?” Three other witnesses who testified against the Ampatuan clan have also been killed as the case has wound its way through the notoriously slow Philippine criminal justice system. Andal Ampatuan Sr., who was among the accused, died of natural causes in prison. International interest in the case has waned over the years, but Filipino reporters have kept a spotlight on it because so many of their colleagues died in the massacre. The delays led the country’s Supreme Court to appoint a special court to focus exclusively on the case and expedite testimony to speed up the proceedings. “This is justice,” Martin Andanar, a spokesman for the Philippine government, said after the verdicts. “It was admittedly a slow process, but we have to go through it as warranted by our democratic system.” The New York-based Human Rights Watch this week called on the authorities to round up the suspects who are still on the loose, arguing that the families of the victims and witnesses are at risk of being attacked. Phil Robertson, deputy director of the rights group’s Asia division, said Thursday that the verdict “should prompt the country’s political leaders to finally act to end state support for ‘private armies’ and militias that promotes the political warlordism that gave rise to the Ampatuans.” Nena Santos, a lawyer who represented Mr. Mangudadatu, said she had received more than a hundred threats to her life in the past decade. Most of the threats came through text messages, although she said she has been threatened in person, too.  “Name it, I have received it,” she said, alluding to the threats. “In one instance I received a text message at 4:30 in the morning that said ‘the person who is going to kill you is already there at your house.’’’']",A court said leaders of the powerful Ampatuan dynasty were behind the 2009 massacre of a rival politician’s supporters and members of the news media. 
How Russian Propaganda Showed Up in an Italian Murder Trial,2019-12-17,By Anna Momigliano,"['ROME —\xa0Few disputed the guilt of Vitaly Markiv, a Ukrainian who also holds Italian citizenship, when an Italian court sentenced him to 24 years in prison this summer. Most of the evidence showing that he had helped coordinate an artillery strike in a conflict zone of his native country, killing an Italian war photographer, had been retrieved from his electronic devices. But it raised eyebrows when the court released its reasoning in the fall showing that among the evidence presented by Italian prosecutors were reports from publications that are generally considered outlets for Russian propaganda. Experts say the inclusion of two videos from Russia Today, plus a report on the website Russkaya Vesna that the Ukrainian government said was false, raised questions about the extent to which fake news, after infiltrating the West’s news media and elections, is now penetrating its courts. “Contamination is by its nature expansive,” said Luciano Floridi, a professor of philosophy and the ethics of information at Oxford who has studied the effects of disinformation. And it can easily spread from media and politics to the judiciary, he added. Prosecutors said they did not consider the Russia Today reports decisive in the verdict, and members of the jury are not permitted to discuss what convinced them of Mr. Markiv’s guilt.  But the inclusion in court of the propaganda and disinformation, regardless of its persuasiveness, has raised alarm with experts and some politicians. In November,  the Ukrainian government, which was made a co-defendant in the case and thus liable for economic damages, appealed the decision. It has engaged in its own propaganda war with Russia and has routinely blamed Russian disinformation for anything that puts its military in a bad light.  This month, the liberal party, More Europe, argued that the trial was tainted by “hearsay and prejudices” and asked the European Union to send observers to the appeal trial, which is expected to begin this spring. Mr. Markiv, now 30, left Italy to take part in the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv in 2014. When the war erupted in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region a few months later, he joined Ukraine’s National Guard to fight against Russian separatist forces. While a guardsman, prosecutors charged, he helped coordinate an attack by a Ukrainian Army unit against a group of civilians. Among the group was the Italian photographer Andrea Rocchelli, 30, who was killed by the artillery fire along with other journalists on May 24, 2014. For two years, an inquiry by investigators in Pavia, Mr. Rocchelli’s hometown, led nowhere, because of a lack of cooperation from the Ukrainian authorities, said the prosecutor in the case, Andrea Zanoncelli. But in the summer of 2016, Mr. Zanoncelli said, a Google search led him to an article published by Italy’s leading daily newspaper, Corriere della Sera. It was a purported interview with an unidentified captain from the Ukrainian army stationed in the area. “Don’t come here, it’s a strategic area,” the captain was quoted as saying. “Usually we don’t shoot toward the city or at civilians, but as soon as we see anything move, we fire heavy artillery. That’s what happened with the two journalists and their interpreter.” The prosecutor saw it as an admission of guilt, despite Italian journalism’s usual lack of rigor. When the police questioned the article’s author, the journalist told them that the purported interview was a compilation of remarks she had heard in a conversation between the soldier and a photographer.  The Italian police subsequently determined that the anonymous army captain was Mr. Markiv. The Italian authorities began tapping Mr. Markiv’s conversations with his mother in Italy to gain evidence. They arrested him and charged him with murder as he returned to a Bologna airport in June 2017. The case drew high-profile lawyers and became a rallying cry for press freedom. A senator from Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party defended Mr. Markiv. The former left-wing mayor of Milan represented two prominent media guilds, which presented themselves as injured parties, on behalf of the photojournalist. Among the evidence presented were videos described as “open source,” “found on YouTube” or “from a local TV station,” all of which bore the logo of Russia Today and are still found on its YouTube channel. The ruling also cites an article in Russkaya Vesna, alleging that Ukraine’s Interior Ministry conspired with Mr. Markiv’s fellow guardsmen to protect him. It included a document, purportedly leaked from the Ukrainian authorities, instructing Mr. Markiv’s comrades to testify in his favor.  The Ukrainian government said the document was a forgery. “Our interior minister intervened personally to make it clear that the thing was fake,” said Yaroslav Moshkola, an official from the Ukrainian Embassy in Rome. “It’s very strange that the court accepted this document.” The conviction of Mr. Markiv caused outrage in Ukraine. Media outlets and nationalist politicians have sought to exonerate him by discrediting the Italian legal system with claims that the trial in Pavia was tainted by “anti-Ukrainian” bias and Russian propaganda. The prosecutor, Mr. Zanoncelli, said that the article was not pivotal in discrediting the witnesses called by the defense. “They were disproved because they contradicted one another,” he said.  As for the document it cited, he said that “it was never clear how genuine it was” and that he had presented it “to show this thing existed, so that the court could evaluate it.” The jurors wrote in the final ruling that Mr. Markiv’s fellow guardsmen “were instructed to give pre-agreed answers” and that the Russkaya Vesna article “contains some elements that seemed to be pointing toward the truth.” Without addressing Mr. Markiv’s guilt or innocence, Serena Quattrocolo, a law professor at Eastern Piedmont University whose expertise is in the digital distortion of evidence in court, said that more broadly, the inclusion of material found online from disputable sources in Italian courts was “part of an unsettling scenario and of larger problem.” Russia has spread disinformation online as a part of a broader strategy to destabilize the West. The United States Department of Justice has accused a Russian organization linked to the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 elections. Russian-backed groups carried out a disinformation campaign in Europe ahead of the European Union elections in May, according to a report issued by the European Commission. And Kremlin-backed influence networks targeting African countries were recently discovered and taken down by Facebook. Analysts believe the networks could serve as a test for next year’s elections in the United States. Italy is particularly vulnerable. According to Italy’s Authority of Communication, disinformation is growing in the country, although it has not been directly linked to Russia. The lines between mainstream outlets and propaganda are often blurred. The current chair of Italy’s state television broadcaster RAI has spread conspiracy theories online and has been frequently interviewed by Russia Today and Sputnik. In September, the private broadcaster Mediaset aired a “deep fake video,” which used seamless visual effects to doctor speech by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The appearance of Russian propaganda in court crosses a new threshold, a challenge for which Italy may not be fully prepared.  Mr. Markiv is appealing the verdict, which also demanded that Ukraine pay reparations to Mr. Rocchelli’s parents, widow and young son and to the two journalists’ guilds. Paolo Perucchini, who heads one of those guilds, the Lombardy journalists association, praised the verdict as a demonstration that “information is valued in our country.”  Asked about the inclusion of anonymously sourced reporting and Russia Today into evidence, he seemed unbothered. “It’s not up to me to decide if Russia Today spreads fake news,” he said. “Even a broken clock is right twice a day.” ']","The evidence has raised alarms about the extent to which fake news, having infiltrated the West’s media and elections, is penetrating its courts."
"China Commissions 2nd Aircraft Carrier, Challenging U.S. Dominance",2019-12-17,By Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — China commissioned its first domestically built aircraft carrier on Tuesday, reaching a new milestone in its ambitions to build a modern navy capable of challenging American dominance of the seas, especially in the Pacific. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, presided over a commissioning ceremony at the Chinese naval base in Sanya, on the southern island of Hainan, where the vessel will be based, according to video broadcast on China’s state television. From there, the new carrier will be able to project power throughout the disputed islands of the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait — a development that has been watched warily by the United States and other Pacific powers, including Japan and Australia. “This is a major milestone for China,” said Matthew P. Funaiole, a senior fellow with the China Power Project at the Center For Strategic and International Studies in Washington who tracks the country’s military developments. “There are only a handful of countries capable of fielding aircraft carriers, and China now has two, which puts it in elite company.” China has already begun a third carrier at a shipyard near Shanghai, and there are reports of plans for a fourth, which would make it second only to the United States, which currently has 10 aircraft carriers in service. The new carrier, called the Shandong, is modeled after China’s first, the Liaoning, which was purchased from Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union for $20 million and furtively refurbished.  Liaoning joined the fleet of the People’s Liberation Army Navy in 2012, and while not yet tested in combat operations, it has provided the Chinese extensive experience in conducting difficult carrier operations, according to the Pentagon’s latest annual report on Chinese military power. Both carriers are named after provinces in northeastern China. The new one is largely based on the first one’s Soviet-era design — with a distinctive sloping ramp for takeoffs — but it is believed to have included technological enhancements.  It was first put to sea in 2018 but appeared to endure difficulties during its sea trials that delayed its commissioning. As construction finished, the former general manager of the company that built it in the northern port city of Dalian, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, was arrested, tried and convicted of corruption. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison in July. The new carrier is designed to carry 36 J-15 fighter jets — the Liaoning has a capacity of 24 — as well as other aircraft and helicopters. The J-15s, also copied from Soviet designs, have suffered a series of crashes that have called into question the country’s mastery of the technological challenges of naval aviation. China’s two carriers are less sophisticated than the nuclear-powered fleet of the United States, but as symbols of global military power, they are significant achievements for a military that had for decades focused principally on land warfare.  Since taking office in 2012, Mr. Xi has overseen a sweeping modernization program of the powerful, tradition-bound military in China, and the huge expansion of the navy has been a centerpiece. The navy “continues to develop into a global force, gradually extending its operational reach beyond East Asia into a sustained ability to operate at increasingly longer ranges,” the Pentagon’s report said.']",A significant milestone in Xi Jinping’s ambitious drive to turn China into a naval power able to dominate the waters of the South China Sea and beyond.
France Pension Protests: Why Unions Are Up in Arms Against Macron,2019-12-17,By Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — Strikes have disrupted France over the past few weeks, as labor unions angry over President Emmanuel Macron’s planned pension overhauls have ground trains to a halt, kept some schools closed, and taken to the streets to pressure the government.  The protests represent the biggest domestic showdown for Mr. Macron since the Yellow Vest movement last year, and they are testing his reformist zeal as he tries to overhaul a complex but generous pensions system.  The strikes have affected transportation more than any other sector, and have been especially acute in Paris, putting frustrated travelers and weary commuters in the middle of the dispute.  As pressure mounts on the government to end the crisis, here’s what you need to know about the debate.  Everyone expects a state-guaranteed pension, but details vary.  The French pension system has a redistributive, pay-as-you-go structure that functions like group insurance.  Workers and employers pay mandatory payroll taxes, known as social contributions, which are used to fund the pensions of retirees. Workers can also build up their own savings, but that does not constitute the backbone of the system, and private plans like 401(k)’s are uncommon.  Full benefits are earned after 41 years to 43 years of contributions, depending on when workers were born, but they can retire earlier than the legal age of 62 without full benefits.  Those are the general principles, at least: In practice, the system is complicated by 42 different pension programs. Some plans are managed jointly by labor and employer unions, some directly by the French state, and others still by a mix. Some cover tiny segments of the population — employees of the Paris Opera, for instance — while others are vast: The biggest program, for salaried workers in the private sector, covers 80 percent of French retirees; the state is involved because it manages mandatory payroll contributions.  Some are tied to a company (like the national railway company), to a status (like civil servants) or to a profession (like lawyers). Because of demographic trends specific to each plan, some are running surpluses, while others are in deficit.  A worker who changes jobs might jump from plan to plan, paying into one and then into the other, meaning retirees often have multiple pensions.  And rules vary too. Some programs let workers retire early with a full pension, and not all plans calculate pensions the same way. In the private sector, for instance, plans are based on a worker’s 25 highest-earning years; in the public sector they’re based on the last six months, when workers are likely to be at the height of their earning power.  Mostly, but some support simplifying it — as long as pensions don’t take a hit.  The pension system, like universal health care, is part of the generous welfare state that was created after World War II, and many in France are very attached to what they see as a hard-fought guarantee of high living standards for seniors.  In 2018, France had one of the highest income replacement ratios among European Union countries, at nearly 70 percent — excluding other social benefits — and one of the lowest rates of people 65 and older at risk of poverty, around 8 percent, according to Eurostat.  The O.E.C.D. said in a report released this year that  life expectancy after exiting the labor market was “5 years larger than in the O.E.C.D. on average.” Philippe Martinez, the head of the C.G.T., one of the largest unions opposed to Mr. Macron’s plans, said France had “the best retirement system in the world” — a feeling shared by many. But it comes at a cost. France spends roughly 14 percent of its gross domestic product on pensions, more than almost any European country.  The system’s dizzying complexity and alphabet soup of acronyms also make it difficult to understand what one is entitled to. Workers who arguably do the same job, like bus drivers in Paris and in Bordeaux, sometimes get different pensions. “The current system provides effective social protection for current retirees, but it is overly complex,” the O.E.C.D. report said. “Differences across schemes fuel the suspicion that workers covered by other schemes might be better treated.” The government wants a unified, point-based system; but it also wants the French to work longer.  Mr. Macron does not want to change the legal retirement age or the system’s redistributive nature. Instead, he wants to unify the 42 different programs into a single system that uses points, which workers would accumulate and cash in upon retirement.  That will make the system clearer, fairer and better adapted to the modern labor market, Mr. Macron argues, because workers would be able to switch jobs without jumping between retirement programs and would receive points even for short periods of work that currently do not count toward pensions.  But Mr. Macron also wants to put the system on firmer financial footing. In 2018, it was facing a deficit of 2.9 billion euros, or about $3.2 billion, a figure that is projected to balloon to between €7.9 billion and €17.2 billion by 2025 if no action is taken.  There is no imminent threat of collapse, and Mr. Macron’s critics — and even some of his allies — say he should put budgetary concerns on the back burner to focus on setting up the universal system. But the government says it would be “irresponsible” to overhaul the system without getting its finances in order.  Mr. Macron wants to define a new age — separate from the legal age of retirement — that workers would have to reach to receive a full pension, with incentives and penalties encouraging people to work until then, if not longer. The government wants to set that limit, called the “pivot age” or “age of equilibrium,” at 64.  Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said last week that “we must, to preserve our pensions system, work a bit longer,” mainly because of increasing life expectancies. “Do you think for one second that the French would believe me if I said: ‘Here are some new rights that are going to cost money, and I’m not going to tell you how to pay for them,’” Mr. Philippe told TF1, referring to promised measures like a guaranteed minimum pension of €1,000.  “To get their trust, one must say everything: the positives, and also the news that is a bit less popular,” he said.  Labor unions oppose Mr. Macron’s proposals, but for various reasons.  The strikers are angry at the prospect of losing benefits currently afforded to them by their various retirement schemes, and they are worried that their pensions will decrease significantly. Railway workers, for example, do not want to lose the ability to retire early. Teachers, who generally have low incomes, are afraid of losing out if pensions are calculated over their entire career instead of the final six months.  Some unions have vowed to strike through Christmas and beyond if the changes are not scrapped.  In a speech last week, Mr. Philippe, the prime minister, offered a few concessions, like delaying the changes and vowing that many older workers would not be affected.  He also tried to reassure protesters, for instance by promising raises for teachers, insisting that the new system would take difficult working conditions into account, and vowing that the law would prevent the value of accumulated points from decreasing.  But Mr. Philippe failed to mollify the unions opposed to the proposals — and he angered more moderate ones that had been cautiously supportive of the overhaul.  For instance, the C.F.D.T., one of France’s largest labor unions, supports a universal, point-based system but strongly opposes a “pivot age,” which it calls a thinly veiled effort to increase the effective age of retirement that would harm those who started working early.  A lack of clarity — over the value of a point, for example — has also left some French people feeling that they are going to lose out, and the strikers insist that they are defending everyone’s pensions, not just their own. Polls show a majority of support for the strikers, and while they show widespread support for a unified system, many do not trust Mr. Macron to implement it.  The government is expected to put legislation up for discussion in Parliament in February, and it hopes to get a vote by the summer.  But there is no end in sight for the strikes. ']",The country has been gripped by strikes over President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul a generous but dizzyingly complex pension system.
Italian Police Arrest Over 300 in Raids on Organized Crime,2019-12-19,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The Italian police on Thursday arrested more than 330 people, including politicians, lawyers, accountants and a local police chief, in one of the most extensive law enforcement operations ever against the crime syndicate known as ’Ndrangheta. About 3,000 officers made pre-dawn arrests in 12 Italian regions, as well as in Switzerland, Germany and Bulgaria, officials said. ’Ndrangheta has spread far beyond its historic base in the southern region of Calabria, surpassing the Cosa Nostra, based in Sicily, to become Italy’s most powerful mafia group. The group controls much of Europe’s cocaine trade, European officials say. Nicola Gratteri, the anti-mafia prosecutor who coordinated the operation, described Thursday’s crackdown as “the biggest operation after the Palermo maxi trial,” a reference to a sweep in 1984 that led to a landmark trial against some 450 Sicilian mafia members. That case severely weakened the Cosa Nostra, but its decline permitted the Calabrian syndicate to grow more powerful. Thursday’s operation “completely dismembered the top ranks of the Mancuso family,” the long-established ’Ndrangheta clan operating in the city of Vibo Valentia, with links to the United States, Mr. Gratteri said. The family had infiltrated local politics and public administration, as well as the local economy, he said. The police blitz had been scheduled for Friday but was hastily brought forward a day when investigators discovered that someone had tipped off the mobsters and their associates to the impending arrests. “Can you imagine what it means to move 3,000 men in the space of 24 hours?” Mr. Gratteri asked reporters in Catanzaro, Calabria, where he is chief prosecutor. “It’s something crazy. But we had to move crazily.” The police arrested Luigi Mancuso, whom officials described as the head of the clan, along with dozens of others believed to have ties to the ’Ndrangheta. They also arrested a lawyer and former member of the Italian Parliament from former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party; the president of the Calabrian mayor’s association, a former member of the Democratic Party’s national assembly, and an array of civil servants and other white-collar professionals accused of working with the mob.  They face a variety of charges, including murder, extortion, usury, money laundering, drug trafficking, corruption and belonging to a criminal syndicate. The police also seized property and cash valued at 15 million euros, or about $16.7 million. The Mancuso clan had dominated the area of Vibo Valentia since the 1970s, and had been “marked by prosecutors” in the past, said Enzo Ciconte, an expert in organized crime. But Thursday’s operation “could be the final blow,” he said in an interview. Claudio Cordova, the editor of the online Calabria newspaper Il Dispaccio and the author of a recent book about links between the ’Ndrangheta and Freemasonry, said the operation had struck one of Calabria’s most powerful clans, and had exposed their links “with politicians and professionals.” But Mr. Cordova complained that Calabria, “a difficult territory,” rarely got the support that it needed from the national government, making the eradication of criminal groups more difficult. “Calabria needs to become a national case, like Sicily was,” he said. The Mancuso clan is “one of the most involved in international drug trafficking with international ramifications worldwide,” said Antonio Nicaso, an expert on the ’Ndrangheta and its history who has written several books with Mr. Gratteri. Mr. Nicaso added that the Mancusos were able to amass a huge amount of money from their trafficking. Thursday’s operation “uncovered the link between the Mancuso clan with what I like to call the ‘upper-world,’” he said, citing professionals, politicians, bureaucrats and freemasons as examples.  “What I try to explain all the time is that violence is the backbone but power is the lifeblood of any major criminal organization such as the ’Ndrangheta,” he said. “And if you can’t combine the underworld and the upper world, there will be no power and there will be no future for a criminal organization.” Mr. Gratteri said the investigation began shortly after he was appointed chief prosecutor of Catanzaro, in May 2016. The operation was named “Scott-Rinascita.” “Rinascita” means rebirth, referring to “the rebirth of the territory,” Mr. Gratteri said in a telephone interview. “Scott,” he said, was added in memory of Scott W. Sieben, an agent with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration who “worked with us on many missions,” when he was based in Rome, from 2008 to 2013, and who died in 2015, after returning to the United States. Mr. Gratteri said he believed the operation on Thursday had dealt a profound blow to the Mancuso family, but he cautioned that “you don’t resolve the problem of the mafia with overnight blitzes.” To wipe it out, he said, requires changes in the culture that has accepted it, and better laws against organized crime. “Now it’s up to civil society to occupy the spaces that we created today,” he added. “Otherwise we’re back to square one, and criminals will reoccupy those spaces.” ']","Officials said they had dismantled a major crime family within the ’Ndrangheta, the group based in the southern region of Calabria that is Italy’s most powerful mafia syndicate."
Spain Bars Catalan Leader From Public Office for 18 Months,2019-12-19,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — A Spanish court on Thursday barred the leader of the restive northeastern region of Catalonia from public office for 18 months, for civil disobedience in his show of support for jailed separatists, in a ruling that is likely to fuel the anger of Catalan people who want to break away from Spain. The ruling by a court in Barcelona dealt with yellow ribbons that are displayed throughout Catalonia in solidarity with separatists whose supporters consider them political prisoners of Spain’s central government. Last spring, Quim Torra, the separatist regional president of Catalonia, refused to take down ribbons and other signs on public buildings, in defiance of an order by the electoral commission in Madrid that all partisan symbols be removed from such buildings during the political campaign leading up to a parliamentary election in April. The ruling, which Mr. Torra said he would appeal, was the latest in a long series of clashes pitting Spain’s central government and its judiciary against Catalan leaders who favor independence. Politicians have failed for years to resolve the secessionist conflict, and it has increasingly been left to judges to handle, while continuing to split Catalan society down the middle and fueling street violence. Also on Thursday, the European Union’s highest court made a significant decision in favor of the former deputy leader of Catalonia, Oriol Junqueras, who is serving a prison sentence for sedition. The European Court of Justice ruled that the Spanish authorities should have released Mr. Junqueras so that he could take the seat he won this year in the European Parliament. In October, Spain’s Supreme Court sentenced Mr. Junqueras and eight other former Catalan leaders to prison for their involvement in a botched attempt to secede from Spain in 2017, after holding an independence referendum that had been declared unconstitutional by Spanish courts. Mr. Junqueras received the toughest sentence, 13 years in prison, after he was found guilty of sedition and misuse of public funds. But the European Court ruled that as a member of the European Parliament, Mr. Junqueras had a degree of legal immunity — a decision that has wider repercussions for the longstanding Catalan secessionist movement.  Two other Catalan politicians, Carles Puigdemont, the former separatist leader of Catalonia, and Toni Comín, a former regional minister, who also won seats in the European Parliament in May, also hope to use their recent elections to avoid extradition and prosecution in Spain. On Twitter, Mr. Puigdemont said the ruling was a victory of voters “against authoritarian forces.”  Mr. Junqueras’s case has been regarded as a test of whether European Union parliamentary immunity can override national criminal court proceedings and could affect similar cases.  The European Court ruled that a politician is elected to the European Parliament as soon as the results of the vote are made official, and can immediately benefit from immunity and other privileges granted to European Union lawmakers.  The court determined that Spain was wrong to prevent Mr. Junqueras from taking his seat in the European Parliament while he was in jail awaiting sentencing. It did not say that the sentencing itself was improper. It is unclear what effect the ruling will have on Mr. Junqueras’s case, however, as the court left it up to Spain’s Supreme Court to decide on the practical impact of immunity. It is unlikely that Spain would now release him. The sentencing of Mr. Junqueras and others in October reignited tensions within Catalonia and led to several nights of violence on the streets of Barcelona and other cities as protesters lit fires and threw rocks at the police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.  While the violence had eased in recent weeks, a much-anticipated soccer match between Barcelona and Real Madrid on Wednesday was followed by violent clashes between the police and protesters outside the Barcelona stadium. The October Supreme Court ruling in Spain allowed the country’s judiciary to reactivate international arrest warrants against Mr. Puigdemont and some members of his cabinet. They fled to Brussels in October 2017 after Spain’s government forced their ouster from office. This month, a Belgian court postponed an extradition case against Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Comín, deciding to wait for the European Court ruling on the extent of parliamentary immunity. The election of Catalan separatist politicians to the European Parliament has turned into a political hot potato for the European Union, which has been under pressure to clarify how tightly its members are bound by European law. The Parliament said it would enforce whatever decision was taken by the European Union’s highest court. On Thursday, Mr. Torra joined other separatist politicians in calling for the immediate release of Mr. Junqueras, while maintaining his defiant stance in his own court case.  “My faith in Spanish justice is zero,” Mr. Torra said. “We have to find justice outside when we see how it is denied to us here.” He added: “While we see in Europe an example of justice, Spain continues down the path of repression.” Mr. Junqueras was elected to the European Parliament in May, while in jail in Spain awaiting sentencing. His lawyers have argued that Spain’s judiciary breached his fundamental rights by refusing to let him swear an oath to the Spanish Constitution in order to take up his seat in the European Parliament. The Spanish Supreme Court eventually referred the issue to the European Court of Justice, which is based in Luxembourg. Mr. Junqueras was jailed over two years ago, but has continued to lead his party, Esquerra Republicana, which is now the largest separatist party in the Spanish Parliament. In recent weeks the party has been at the heart of the latest round of negotiations to form a new government in Madrid.  Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s caretaker Socialist prime minister, won a repeat national election in November, but did not come close to a parliamentary majority. Two days after the election, Mr. Sánchez agreed to form a coalition government with a smaller left-wing party, Unidas Podemos, but he has failed so far to persuade other factions to support him.  Catalan separatist parties hold 23 of the 350 seats in Spain’s Parliament, which puts them in a position to give Mr. Sánchez the necessary support to form a government.  Mr. Sánchez’s government did not immediately react to the court ruling on Mr. Junqueras, but some politicians have criticized the European Court for intervening in Spanish affairs.  Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, a politician with the ultranationalist Vox party, told a news conference that the ruling was “a blow for Spain” and an attack on its sovereignty. In July, thousands of Catalan independence supporters gathered at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, to denounce the fact that the newly elected assembly was meeting without some of its Catalan representatives.  Mr. Junqueras has also received support from fellow European lawmakers who have protested the moves to prevent a democratically elected politician from taking his seat.  The European Court ruling comes after the court’s main legal adviser issued a legal opinion last month advising that parliamentary immunity be recognized at the time of election, independent of what procedures different European Union countries use for politicians to be sworn into office.']","A Barcelona court ruled that Quim Torra, the president of the Catalonia region, cannot hold office, after he refused to remove yellow ribbons that signal support of jailed separatist leaders."
India Adopts the Tactic of Authoritarians: Shutting Down the Internet,2019-12-17,"By Jeffrey Gettleman, Vindu Goel and Maria Abi-Habib","['NEW DELHI — As the government of India pushes increasingly provocative policies, it is using a tactic to stifle dissent that is more commonly associated with authoritarian regimes, not democracies: It is shutting down the internet. India tops the world — by far — in the number of internet shutdowns imposed by local, state and national governments. Last year, internet service was cut in India 134 times, and so far this year, 93 shutdowns have occurred, according to SFLC.in, which relies on reports from journalists, advocacy groups and citizens.  The country’s closest competitor is Pakistan, which had 12 shutdowns last year. Syria and Turkey — countries not especially known for their democratic spirit — each shut down the internet just once in 2018.  “Any time there is a sign of disturbance, that is the first tool in the toolbox,” said Mishi Choudhary, founder of SFLC.in, a legal advocacy group in New Delhi that has tracked India’s internet shutdowns since 2012. “When maintenance of law and order is your priority, you are not thinking about free speech.” Last week, citing a threat of violence and false rumors, authorities in the states of Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura in northeast India severed connectivity in response to protests against a new citizenship law that critics say would marginalize India’s 200 million Muslims. Much of West Bengal and parts of Uttar Pradesh, two of India’s most populous states, were also put under digital lockdown.  With the Kashmir region still languishing offline since August, at least 60 million people have been cut off — roughly the population of France. These moves come as  Prime Minister Narendra Modi tightens his grip on India. His administration and its allies have jailed hundreds of Kashmiris without charges, intimidated journalists, arrested intellectuals and suppressed gloomy economic reports. His critics say he is undermining India’s deeply rooted traditions of democracy and secularism, and steadily stamping out dissent. [Read: As Modi pushes a Hindu nationalist agenda, a secular India is fighting back.] With half a billion Indians online, the authorities say they are simply trying to stop the spread of hateful and dangerous misinformation, which can move faster on Facebook, WhatsApp and other services than their ability to control it. “A lot of hate and provocative stuff starts appearing on messaging services, particularly WhatsApp,” said Harmeet Singh, a senior police official in Assam, which borders Bangladesh and has been one of the hot spots of protests against the citizenship law.  But as the internet becomes more integral to all aspects of life, the shutdowns affect far more than protesters or those involved in politics. The shutdowns can be devastating to people just trying to make a living.  In Kashmir, internet service was stopped on Aug. 5, when Mr. Modi’s government suddenly revoked the area’s autonomy, sent in thousands of troops, and disabled all communication, stifling public dissent. The internet has now been off 135 days. Some people even take a short flight to the next state just to check their email. “There is no work,’’ said Sheikh Ashiq Ahmad, the president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce. He said thousands of entrepreneurs, especially those who make silk scarves and handicrafts, relied on social media to sell their products online.  “The dignity of these people has been taken away,’’ he said. While many of India’s shutdowns have been intended to prevent the loss of life, some occurred for more mundane reasons, like to make it harder for students to cheat on exams. The legality of India’s internet shutdowns has not been tested in court. All shutdowns are supposed to be authorized by top state or national officials. In practice, most are ordered by local authorities, sometimes with just a few phone calls to local service providers.  The effectiveness of these shutdowns isn’t clear. Research by Jan Rydzak, a scholar at Stanford University, suggests that the information vacuum caused by an internet shutdown can actually encourage violent responses. On Tuesday, fresh protests broke out across the country once again over the citizenship law. In Kolkata, protesters blocked highways, and in New Delhi, police officers clashed with demonstrators, firing tear gas and tugging away participants by the collar of their jackets.  In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, opposition politicians led rowdy rallies against the new citizenship law, Citizenship Amendment Act, which favors non-Muslim immigrants seeking citizenship in India.  Many people are also upset about the National Register of Citizens, a citizenship review process that has already left nearly two million people in Assam potentially stateless. Amit Shah, India’s home minister and Mr. Modi’s right-hand man, has vowed to take the citizenship reviews nationwide. Many Indians, especially members of the Muslim minority, believe that with the new measures, the Modi government is plotting to strip away rights from Muslims.  They fear that the government could force citizenship reviews on all Indians and that Hindus without proper papers would be allowed to stay in India while Muslims without proper papers would be asked to leave.  Mr. Modi and his allies deny this, saying they are simply trying to address illegal migration and help persecuted minorities at the same time.  Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have roots deep in a Hindu-centric worldview that believes India, which is 80 percent Hindu, should be a Hindu homeland. Some of their biggest moves, including the crackdown on Kashmir, which was India’s only Muslim-majority state, have been widely seen as intentionally anti-Muslim. In West Bengal, which is about 27 percent Muslim, violent protests around these policies erupted on Friday. Protesters ransacked more than a dozen train stations. By Sunday, the authorities shut down the internet for more than one-fourth of the state’s 90 million people. Sujauddin Shekh, a college teacher in Murshidabad, said the shutdowns have left many people unable to know what’s going on.  “People in this region are largely dependent on Facebook and WhatsApp for the news,” he said.  There is no doubt that a lot of potentially dangerous information flows freely through India’s cyberspace, especially during crises. Take the example of the five women filmed rescuing a friend from being beaten up by police during a protest. Overnight, they became heroes —\xa0and targets.  On Sunday, videos went viral showing the five young women, students at a predominantly Muslim university in New Delhi, forming a protective circle around a young man as police officers beat him with wooden poles.  Several officials in Mr. Modi’s party tried to sully  their reputations; one wrote a  tweet calling them “rabidly indoctrinated Islamists.”  There is no evidence of that and in fact, one of the girls, 20-year-old Chanda Yadav, is a Hindu.  Ms. Yadav said the campaign to discredit her has been almost too much to bear. Still, she wants to speak out. “This fight is about India as a secular nation, an India where we all belong,” she said. But in places where the internet has been cut off, it’s harder to freely debate these questions. On Dec. 11, the authorities in Assam shut down everything but a government-run landline internet service, which was necessary to keep banks, universities and other institutions online. On Tuesday, they restored most landline internet service, but mobile internet, which is how most Indians stay connected, remained off. “Peace is more important than a little inconvenience to you and me,” said Mr. Singh, the Assam police official.

"In India Tech City Shocked by Gang Rape, Vigilante Justice Gets Praise",2019-12-21,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['HYDERABAD, India —\xa0All day, every day, at a certain point along a highway leading out of Hyderabad, people stop their cars and get out to peer over the guardrail. It was here, under a highway bridge, that four men torched the body of a young veterinarian after they gang-raped and suffocated her a few weeks ago in a case that horrified the country.  Nearby is another likely crime scene of note: In the green fields that gently roll away from the highway stands a ring of yellow police tape where the police gunned down the four accused men. The police say there was a shootout, and that they killed the men in self-defense. But that is now under investigation, and most people around here seem to believe it was a straight-up case of extrajudicial killing.  None of this happened in an isolated part of India or in some tough, broken place. It happened on the busy outskirts of one of India’s most up-and-coming cities: Hyderabad.  Apple. Google. Facebook. Uber. All have big offices in Hyderabad. So does Amazon, which this year opened its largest office building in the world right here, a futuristic campus with 15,000 employees.  The city, already a huge metropolis of around 10 million, is growing by leaps and bounds. It is famous for its spicy food, fancy shops, rich residents and good relations between Muslims and Hindus. Many Muslims in Hyderabad have joined the protests sweeping the country over a separate issue — a divisive new citizenship law that many Indians feel discriminates against Muslims in this Hindu-majority nation. But the scourge of gang rape is never far from people’s minds.  Most Hyderabadis seem to believe that the police officers shot the rape suspects in cold blood and then placed guns in their hands. Still, many said it was the right thing to do. One crowd even showered police officers in rose petals. “It was the need of the hour,” said Akkineni Nagarjuna, a Hyderabad movie star. “Somebody had to put the fear of God in them.”  The shootings have uncapped a wave of vigilante violence against other rape suspects. One was nearly lynched a few days later on his way to court in Indore.  Many Indians are so fed up with the courts — and it’s not just that trials can drag on for years, but so often infamous criminals evade justice — that they crave swift and decisive punishment, however it comes.  “This is what I like about Hyderabad,” said Akash Chaturvedi, the sales manager at an exotic car dealership in the city. “People here are direct. They take action. They hit their targets.’’  “I meet 20 to 25 people a day: politicians, bureaucrats, big businessmen, celebrities,” he added, as he paused in front of a blue Lamborghini. “Not a single one is unhappy with the action that has taken place.”  Cities anywhere contain jarring contradictions: misery and success, crime and erudition, grit and glitz, all stacked on top of each other. This is especially true in Hyderabad, a fast-changing place in southern India that is striving to be included on the list of the country’s supercities, along with Delhi and Mumbai.  Centuries ago, Hyderabad was the seat of a vast Muslim kingdom that made a fortune from nearby diamond mines, producing some of history’s biggest gems, including the colossal 105.6 carat Koh-i-Noor, which British colonizers snatched.  Today, strong infrastructure and business friendly policies adopted by Hyderabadi officials have attracted so many cyber-based companies that an outlying part of the area is now called Cyberabad. This is where the bloodshed unfolded. Adding to the suspicions of police foul play is that V.C. Sajjanar, Cyberabad’s police commissioner, was the supervising officer in at least two other cases of suspects killed by the police. In each incident, the officers said they acted in self-defense. In this case, the police were under heavy pressure. After the news broke that the veterinarian had been raped and killed, protests erupted across India. Demonstrators demanded that the suspects be hanged.  The outcry was not as seismic as what followed after a young woman was gang raped and fatally brutalized on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012, but the incidents presented disturbing parallels. In both, the young women were on professional tracks, and the weak link was having to rely on nighttime transport that left them vulnerable. In the Delhi attack, a woman who was about to become a physiotherapist came out of a movie theater around 9:30 p.m. She needed a ride and accepted one from an off-duty bus with few passengers.  In Hyderabad, the 26-year-old veterinarian, whose name Indian officials have asked not to be disclosed, parked her motor scooter at a toll plaza outside of a central district around 6 p.m. on Nov. 27. She grabbed a shared taxi to a mall about 10 miles away, a common practice to spare drivers a grueling scooter ride.  But she was being watched.  The police said that four men who worked on a freight truck — Mohammed Arif, Shiva Kumar, Jollu Naveen Kumar and Chintakunta Chenna Keshavulu — deflated her scooter’s back tire right after she left. Then they fortified themselves with a couple bottles of cheap Imperial Blue whiskey, and waited. India’s rates of sex crimes don’t appear higher than many other countries, including the United States. But activists say India has a particular gang rape problem.  Last year, for example, virtually the entire male staff at an upscale apartment complex in Chennai conspired to rape an 11-year-old disabled girl.  And some of the most widely publicized criminal cases in India have turned on rape and murder. Sexual violence experts say this is because many rapists feel that if they destroy the evidence, they will have a good chance of getting away with the crime.  “The problem in India is the failure of the criminal justice system,’’ said Sunitha Krishnan, who runs an anti-sexual trafficking organization in Hyderabad. According to the police, the veterinarian came back from the mall at 9:30 p.m. and when the group of men offered to help her with her flat tire, she sensed danger. On her last phone call, to her sister, right before going with them, she said she was scared.  The men pulled her into a vacant lot. They raped her. She bled badly and fainted.  When she came to, Mr. Arif, the ringleader, according to the police, decided to kill her, smothering her with his hands. The four dragged her body into their truck and drove off to the stretch of fields and highway where they set her on fire.  The police were able to use closed-circuit video footage to identify the truck, which led them to the suspects, and all four confessed, the police said.  They were in custody on Dec. 6 when the officers took them out of jail and back to the crime scene, at 3 a.m. The police said that they needed the men to re-enact the crime, and that two of the suspects grabbed officers’ guns, provoking a shootout. Several legal activists in Delhi have filed lawsuits against the police, saying the shooting amounted to a summary execution. And the families of two of the suspects said that they were minors. But you would struggle to find any others in Hyderabad willing to take the dead men’s side.  “Justice is good,’ said Minhaj Obaid, who works in a call center for Dell computers, as he stood on the highway bridge.  “And instant justice,’’ he said, smiling, “is even better.”  Hari Kumari contributed from New Delhi and S.M. Bilal from Hyderabad']","Hyderabad is a fast-modernizing metropolis, and violence against men accused of rape is finding support. "
Iraq in Worst Political Crisis in Years as Death Toll Mounts From Protests,2019-12-21,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — For 12 weeks, Iraqi protesters have massed in the streets of Baghdad and cities in southern Iraq to demand the ouster of the government, an end to corruption and a halt to the overweening influence of Iran. And for 12 weeks, the government has foundered in its response, alternating vague promises of reform with brutal treatment of protesters by its security forces. More than 500 protesters have been killed and 19,000 wounded, according to the United Nations special envoy to Iraq, but the violent response has only deepened protesters’ resolve.  The prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, has resigned but has remained in a caretaker role, and Parliament has yet to come up with someone to replace him. The political crisis that now confronts Iraq is as serious as any since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein 16 years ago, and its leaders appear ill-equipped to reckon with it. No consensus has emerged for a plan to reform the government to meet the protesters’ demands.  Parliament has not seriously considered even the proposed changes to the election law put forward by President Barham Salih, which would reduce the influence of parties and the corruption they foster. This week, a constitutional deadline for Parliament to nominate a new prime minister came and went. Even finding an acceptable candidate for prime minister is a tall order. “It’s very difficult to find someone who is both broadly acceptable to the street, to the protesters, but who also has the party support, the political support to navigate the transition,” said Maria Fantappie, a senior adviser on Iraq and Syria for the International Crisis Group.  Even if they did, that would hardly begin to address the protesters’ sweeping demands. “Our goal is not to have Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resign,” said Mehdi Chassin, a college student from Amara, in southern Iraq, who came to Baghdad to join the protests. “That makes no difference because another guy will come who will be just the same. We want them all to go.” But Parliament is unlikely to adopt reforms that would end the careers of everyone in it, and the protesters are unlikely to accept anything less.  “What the parties want is rejected by the Iraqi people and what the Iraqi people want is rejected by the parties,” said Karim al-Nuri, a senior official in the Badr Organization, one of the parties that is close to Iran, but has a diverse membership. “So there are two alternatives: either to change the Iraqi people or to change some of the political class and make some change in the political process.” Parliament also seems unprepared to find a way to reduce Iranian influence. Iranian political and military operatives — including senior figures like Qassim Soleimani, the head of the powerful Quds Force that reports to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — have been in and out of Baghdad trying to ensure that whoever is nominated for prime minister meets Iran’s needs. So, rather than debate the protesters’ demands directly, members of Parliament talk about how much they are doing — passing legislation to limit salaries of the ministers for instance. Qais al-Khazali, the leader of one of the Shiite parliamentary blocs close to Iran, said, “We have enacted legislation, that is our responsibility, now the government’s responsibility is to enforce it.” When the protests started on Oct. 1, many who came to demonstrate in Baghdad and across southern Iraq were demanding jobs and services such as electricity and clean water. But after the government opened fire on them, killing more than 100 in the first five days, the number of protesters multiplied and they began to agitate for more far-reaching changes. Overhauling the entire system of government seems far from politically possible. But the protesters’ focus reflects their frustration with the government’s failure to foster economic opportunity or deal with entrenched corruption. These grievances unite all of those who have come to the street: the young people, the workers, the poor, the educated and the barely literate, the tribal leaders as well as urban street sweepers. Some members of Parliament acknowledge that they are engaged in a different struggle: the allocation of spoils in the next government. The discussions over choosing a new prime minister, they said, have centered less on the ideals and desires of the Iraqi people than on political power and money. “There’s a lot of division about who comes next as prime minister, and that’s a problem because the political parties are redividing up the ministries, looking to figure out who gets which ministry share,” said Haithem al-Jubori the head of Parliament’s finance committee. Iran is particularly concerned that it maintain influence in Iraq’s ministries, especially those dealing with security and economic matters. With America’s tight sanctions against Iran, Tehran increasingly needs Iraq in order to “breathe” economically — both for its markets and for military purposes, to protect its interests in Syria and Lebanon.  The parties that are most powerful and closest to Iran are those that grew out of the armed Shiite groups. It is militia units from ministries controlled by those parties, or agencies of the prime minister, that are blamed by human rights activists for the most violent attacks on the protesters. In responding to the protests with violence, these forces are taking a page from the Iranian playbook: When Tehran was faced with protests over gas prices in November, it crushed them brutally, killing as many as 450 people in four days and imprisoning 7,000. While the pace of killings in Iraq has ebbed and flowed, the attacks have become more brutal and there has been an increase in kidnappings, arrests and disappearances of protest leaders, doctors who treat wounded protesters, and journalists. Human Rights Watch and the United Nations Human Rights Commission have called on the government to halt its lawless crackdown. Human Rights Watch has demanded that the United States and Europe to do more to censure the government. For those demonstrating, the more comrades they lose, the harder it is to give up, said Haithem al-Mayahi, a protest leader from Karbala, who said he tried for years to work within the political system.  “The protesters lost hundreds of their friends, their brothers, their family members,” he said. “It’s either you fight to win or you die.” What remains uncertain is whether such continued fighting will lead to political change. One longtime Iraq watcher, the former American ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, said of the protesters, “Unless some leader or cadre of leaders emerges, not much is going to happen and the overthrow of the government is highly unlikely.” “The prime minister has resigned and no one else probably will be named quickly,” Mr. Crocker said. “And that, in a perverse way, keeps the government safe because there is nothing to overthrow, so things just keep going along.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting.

3 French Executives Convicted in Suicides of 35 Workers,2019-12-20,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — The former chief executive of one of France’s biggest companies and two subordinates were convicted on Friday of “institutional moral harassment” in the suicides of 35 employees in the mid-2000s, in a landmark ruling that represents the first time a French company has been held responsible for such a crime. The chief executive, Didier Lombard, who led France Télécom, the former national telephone company that is now the telecommunications giant Orange, was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $16,000, as were the company’s second-in-command and its director of human resources at the time. Orange was fined the maximum $83,000. The criminal court in Paris found that the three men were responsible for creating an atmosphere of fear during a desperate company restructuring that led directly to the suicides and attempted suicides of numerous employees. Current and former workers gave wrenching testimony in a three-month trial this spring and summer about the severe anxiety that prevailed as the executives tackled a $50 billion debt by trying to get rid of 22,000 employees, out of a total of 120,000. Most of the employees were civil servants and thus could not be fired. The court found on Friday that the ends in no way justified the methods. “The means chosen to reach 22,000 departures were illegitimate,” the court said in its ruling. The executives put in place “a conscious scheme to worsen the work conditions of the employees in order to speed up departures,” it said, and that the policy “created a climate of anxiety” that led to the suicides. The executives said in the trial that workers had left the company voluntarily, a claim contradicted in the ruling and by Mr. Lombard’s own statements at the time. He told other company officials in 2006 that the employees would have to leave “by the window or the door.” The former executives — Mr. Lombard; his second in command, Louis-Pierre Wenès; and the former human resources director, Olivier Barberot — said they would appeal the Paris court’s ruling.  Unions representing the employees hailed the convictions. “Let this serve as an example so that never again will there be such a policy of social violence,” the C.F.E.-C.G.C. union said on Twitter. The wave of suicides, and the trial of the executives more than 10 years later, riveted France, a nation in which many have conflicted attitudes toward work and capitalism, visible in the current wave of strikes over the government’s plan to overhaul the pension system. The testimony this year depicted a grim universe of underemployment, marginalization, miscasting and systematic harassment at France Télécom. Employees spoke of despairing colleagues who hanged themselves, set themselves on fire, or threw themselves out of windows, under trains and off bridges and highway overpasses as the company deliberately pushed them into roles for which they were unsuited — sales jobs for technicians, for instance — to try to reduce the work force. The trial also highlighted the immobility of the French labor market, as most of the workers expected to stay at the company for the rest of their working lives, rarely considering changing employers or locations.']","The employees at France Télécom killed themselves in the mid-2000s after management sought to reduce the work force through a policy of harassment, a court found."
They Built a Homeland Far From China’s Grip. Now They’re Afraid.,2019-12-21,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Six years ago, he fled China’s crackdown on Muslim Uighurs and sought refuge in Turkey, joining a community of fellow exiles. He started a business with his brother, translating and publishing self-help books into their language. His wife got a job as a teacher in a Uighur school where his children began to take classes. Now, Ablet Abdugani worries the life he built will disappear.  The Turkish government told him he had to leave the country. That could mean being sent back to China and likely straight into detention in a sprawling network of internment camps where about one million Muslims are held. “I am scared whenever the door opens,” Mr. Abdugani said in his apartment on the far outskirts of Istanbul. “I feel very sad about my six years here.” Uighurs have left China in droves as the government intensified a campaign of assimilation in the western region of Xinjiang. In the last three years, at least 11,000 have landed in Turkey, long a favored haven. Now, they worry they could become pawns in a geopolitical game.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who a decade ago called Beijing’s treatment of the Uighurs a genocide, has tried to reduce his country’s reliance on the West by turning to nations such as China. In recent years, he has secured billions of dollars in loans and investments from the Asian giant to help prop up the faltering Turkish economy.  Earlier this year, Turkey deported at least four Uighurs to Tajikistan. From there, they were sent back to China, alarming the Uighur community and drawing protests on social media. Turkish authorities later said they would not send any Uighurs back to China. But Mr. Abdugani, who was not deported, and many others like him remain anxious. “We are caught in the middle of Chinese-Turkish relations and we don’t even know how much we are worth,” Mr. Abdugani said. For those who have fled China, Turkey has offered them a place to reimagine their homeland. Their people share a common heritage and similar languages. Turkey’s government recognizes Turkic people as their own, making it a rare Muslim-majority nation that has spoken up for the Uighurs despite China’s objections. They can practice Islam without fear and celebrate the culture of their 12 million people. They teach classes on religion and the Uighur language and hold a yearly rally for their rights, activities that would be risky, or even banned, in China. But many Uighurs in Turkey find themselves in a state of impermanence. They are denied work permits and business licenses, and in some cases permanent residence and citizenship. Once their Chinese passports expire, they are left effectively stateless. The Uighurs speak a Turkic language and write in an Arabic script. Their mosques feature turquoise tiled domes, their homes are decorated with Afghan-style rugs and their kitchens serve up cumin-spiced lamb pilaf and naan. Some refer to their homeland — an expanse of deserts, mountains and ancient oasis towns — not by its official Chinese name but as East Turkestan, the name of two short-lived Uighur republics. In their new home in Turkey, the Uighurs found something rare: a chance to restore their way of life and the reservoir of collective memory that China’s ruling Communist Party has sought to erode. China intensified restrictions on the Uighurs after a spate of violent attacks in 2014 that the authorities blamed on extremists. Arrests and criminal convictions soared.  The authorities have confiscated Uighur books, restricted the use of the language in schools and detained scholars, artists and intellectuals, among others, in indoctrination camps.  Omer Hemdulla was studying in the Middle East in 2017 when his family in China warned him against going home. The authorities had arrested his brothers and confiscated their businesses, they told him.  He went to Turkey and took over a bookstore in Istanbul in January, joining a burgeoning trade of printing books in the Uighur language. “The entire Uighur nation is in danger. Our people are being tortured,” said Mr. Hemdulla, 30, a law graduate.  He and his business partner, Nur Ahmet Mahmut, 32, publish anything they can find, from Uighur history and literature to children’s stories and cookery books. They sell symbols of their hoped-for republic, East Turkestan — such as its sky blue flag with white crescent and star — items that are outlawed in China. Mr. Hemdulla stocks books that were banned in Xinjiang. Among the most popular, he said, are the novel “Awakened Land,” by Abdurehim Otkur, a well-known Uighur author, and “East Turkestan History” by Muhamet Emin Bugra, an exiled Turkic Muslim leader. “I only read them when I came to Turkey and I realized China oppressed and occupied us a long time ago,” he said. His shop is among half a dozen bookstores in the outlying districts of Sefakoy and Zeytinburnu in Istanbul, where many of the estimated 50,000 Uighurs in Turkey live.  Another publisher, Abduljalil Turan, 61, started his business in the 1990s, focusing on Islamic books and Uighur history and literature. He asked friends to bring books to Turkey and then began publishing works of Uighur exiles, including his own writings. He steadily expanded his stock to 1,000 titles and exports them to Uighur communities around the world. “It is part of the cause,” he said, “to keep awareness alive about our condition.” For many Uighurs brought up under Communism, Turkey provides them a chance to raise a generation unbound by party orthodoxy, children who are free to embrace religion and their ethnic roots. In China, Niaz Abdulla Bostani was imprisoned for three years for teaching the Quran to Uighur children. Now, at 87, he holds religious classes for Uighur children on weekends at a local hall in Istanbul. “Young people come to me and ask questions,” he explained. “Education is the answer. It will not solve things in a few days, but it will affect you all your life.” Abdurashid Niaz, 55, was imprisoned for a year in China in 2005 for translating a book by the Egyptian Islamist Muhammad Qutb from Mandarin to Uighur. He now runs a Uighur school in Istanbul with his wife, and says the internment drive in Xinjiang has made the Uighurs worried about their people’s survival. “Everyone is discussing whether in 50 years, will our culture disappear,” Mr. Abdurashid said. Four children were studying geography with his wife, Anifa Abdurashid, on a recent morning, and they leapt to answer questions about their homeland. “I know the population is 32 million,” the youngest in the class, Abdulla, piped up. The true population of the region of Xinjiang, of which Uighurs make up half, is closer to 24 million, but Mrs. Abdurashid let it go. The Uighurs have preserved their identity through five millenniums, said Ferhat Kurban Tanridagli, a musician and scholar of Turkic languages. He runs an arts school with his wife, a singer, and teaches music and dance to Uighur children. He plays the dutar, a long-necked, two-string lute that has been played for 4,000 years in Central Asia. “Made in Kashgar, in 1993,” he said proudly, turning the instrument of gleaming peanut wood, inlaid with bone, in his hands, referring to the fabled Silk Road trading town which now lives under tight police surveillance. He warned that the Uighurs would not be able to withstand China’s onslaught on their own. “If they destroy us, they will not stop. They will do it to others,” he said. “All the world needs to say to China to stop. We have no other choice.” This summer, the threat of deportation cast a new shadow of uncertainty over the Uighurs.  Mr. Abdugani, the businessman who had been told in July by the government to leave, said 40 others had received similar orders. The Uighurs were deeply troubled when the authorities, as part of a crackdown on illegal immigrants, deported a Uighur woman and her two children to Tajikistan, which sent them back to China. A fourth Uighur, also a woman, was deported as well. The children were handed to their grandmother, but relatives have no news of the two women and fear they have been detained. An estimated 2,500 Uighurs do not have legal residency. Turkey’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said in August that the government was trying to manage migration with “mercy and conscience,” and would not deport Uighurs. Those without residence papers like Mr. Abdugani could seek humanitarian protection, he said. That would grant them refugee status and access to health care services but not allow them to work.  Mr. Abdugani applied for humanitarian protection, but several months later was still waiting for a response and risks arrest for his illegal status. The family was surviving on his wife’s salary and they could not pay for school books or the bus fare, so his children were walking to class most days.  Even as Turkey allows them to stay, many Uighurs said that immigration rules and the state bureaucracy make survival difficult. Mr. Abdugani said he wanted long-term residence, which would allow him to work and support his family, and after seven years, apply for citizenship. Businessmen complain they are restricted from developing their businesses, political activists say the authorities limit their demonstrations, and students are only offered free college education if they study religion.  And there is always a lingering fear of China’s reach. Abdulla Turkestanli, 49, a book publisher, said he was detained without charge by the Turkish authorities for a year in 2017. He suspected that Beijing had complained about him when he opened a second bookstore in the district of Sefakoy. The Turkish authorities never explained why he was detained.  “A lot of writers are in prison or dead” he said. “They are accused of terrorism in China, and so they say we are helping them.” “I am fine, thanks be to God,” he said, “but still, there is danger.”']","China’s repressed Uighurs have long found sanctuary in Turkey.

"Lebanon, Mired in Crises, Turns to a Professor as Prime Minister",2019-12-19,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon’s president appointed a little-known professor and former education minister to form a new government as prime minister on Thursday in the midst of street protests and a financial crisis that have left the country reeling. The appointee, Hassan Diab, vowed to swiftly form a new government to “focus on stopping the collapse and restoring confidence.” But he faces an uphill battle on multiple fronts. Since October, protesters across the country have taken over city squares and blocked main roads in anger over years of corruption and poor governance. That has exacerbated a long-building financial crisis in Lebanon, one of the world’s most indebted countries. Lebanon has been overseen by a caretaker government since Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in the face of mass protests on Oct. 29. It appeared unlikely that the appointment of Mr. Diab, a 60-year-old professor at the American University of Beirut, would quell the protests, and it was unclear whether he could take swift steps to slow the country’s collapse. After other candidates failed to get the necessary parliamentary support, President Michel Aoun named Mr. Diab to form a government on Thursday after he won the support of 69 members of the country’s 128-member Parliament — a simple majority. In Lebanon’s sect-based political system, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, and Mr. Diab’s appointment was unique in that his backing came not from fellow Sunnis but from Christian and Shiite parties. The latter includes Hezbollah, the militant group that the United States and other countries have designated a terrorist organization. That could hamper Mr. Diab’s ability to form a representative cabinet. It could also complicate a new government’s efforts to unlock international assistance, if Mr. Diab is even able to build one. Western countries such as France and the United States, which have supported Lebanon in the past, have hesitated to give aid this time, saying it would be conditioned on political reforms. Some analysts doubted that Mr. Diab’s appointment would be enough to address the country’s simultaneous crises, questioning the qualifications he brought to the difficult job. “You need someone with integrity and vision, someone who understands that Lebanon is at a key juncture both politically and financially — and how are you going to deal with that?” said Sami Atallah, the director of the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies. “You need a skilled team to work on all these issues, and I don’t get a sense that he will be the person who will pull it off.” Late Thursday, protesters gathered at Martyrs’ Square in downtown Beirut to oppose Mr. Diab’s nomination. The protest movement has remained largely leaderless while presenting demands that range from the formation of a government of experts to the ouster of the country’s entire political elite. “Lebanon is passing through a harsh, difficult economic crisis, and Diab doesn’t have the magic wand to solve it,” said Ihab Hassan, a protester. “The new prime minister is going to form the same government based on sharing among sects, and this is what we’ve been demonstrating against for weeks.”']","Hassan Diab, chosen by the president to form a new government, vowed to work swiftly to slow the country’s collapse."
"Queen’s Speech Promises Brexit Soon, and Ambitious Domestic Agenda",2019-12-19,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — The last time Queen Elizabeth II presided over the opening of the British Parliament, only 66 days ago, she arrived in a gilded, horse-drawn carriage and wore an 18-foot velvet cape — a regal symbol of continuity at a time when her country was being convulsed by the debate over Brexit. On Thursday, the queen was back to open Parliament again, arriving by car and clad in a simple teal coat — a no-nonsense approach for a nation that, in the wake of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s sweeping election victory last week, wants desperately to put Brexit behind it and get back to a semblance of normalcy. The queen laid out an ambitious agenda for Mr. Johnson’s government that will include major investments in the National Health Service and law enforcement, ending the austerity policies that characterized nearly a decade of Conservative government. She also confirmed that, as Mr. Johnson promised, Britain will be out of the European Union by Jan. 31. “My ministers will seek a future relationship with the European Union based on a free-trade agreement that benefits the whole of the United Kingdom,” the queen said, delivering the government’s upbeat, likely unrealistic, goal of hammering out a comprehensive deal by the end of next year. But outside the swelling chorus of optimism in the House of Lords, where the queen spoke, there were a few discordant notes.  Just before the queen spoke, one part of her kingdom renewed its quest to break away: The Scottish National Party formally demanded that Scotland be allowed to hold another referendum on independence. Mr. Johnson will almost certainly rebuff the Scots, but since the nationalists rolled back the Conservative Party in Scotland, they are sure to remain a thorn in his side. And retail sales fell for a fourth consecutive month in November, deepening the main street gloom and underscoring the economic threat still posed by the split with the European Union. Still, compared to the last queen’s speech, which was almost lost in the din over Brexit, this ceremony was relatively tranquil. In October, Mr. Johnson’s party had no majority and was essentially powerless to pass any contentious legislation. Britain’s Supreme Court had rebuked him for illegally suspending Parliament amid a bitter debate over his Brexit policy. The queen’s speech amounted to a political pitch by Mr. Johnson to the voters before a general election, fueling criticism that he was exploiting the monarch. This time, the political context could hardly be more different. With Mr. Johnson commanding a hefty majority, his plan to leave the European Union will sail through. He is now shifting attention to what he calls the “people’s priorities” — spending on health care, education and law and order. The queen’s speech was designed to start delivering on his campaign promises. Among them is a pledge to channel more money into the increasingly beleaguered National Health Service. The government enshrined in law Mr. Johnson’s election promise to increase funding of the health service by 33.9 billion pounds, or about $43 billion, by the fiscal year covering 2023 and 2024. The government said it would set up a Royal Commission to review the criminal justice system and pass new espionage legislation to help law enforcement agencies cope with hostile state actors and domestic threats. It also promised a tougher stand on crime, increasing sentences for violent and sexual offenders and requiring those convicted of the worst offenses, including terrorism, to serve more of their sentences. During the final days of the campaign, Britain was rattled by a stabbing attack near London Bridge that killed two people, as well as the assailant, an Islamic extremist who had been released from prison. The police classified it as an act of terrorism, and it prompted a debate over sentencing for extremists. Mr. Johnson is taking aim at the court that ruled against him for suspending Parliament. He plans to review the powers of the nation’s top judges through a new Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission. And having bridled under an act of Parliament that makes it hard for prime ministers to call a general election at a time of their choosing, he is now moving to scrap it. “This is not a program for one year or one Parliament,” Mr. Johnson declared in the House of Commons “It is a blueprint for the future of Britain.” Jeremy Corbyn, the vanquished leader of the Labour Party, claimed in Parliament on Thursday that the prime minister had appropriated much of his social agenda from the opposition, and mocked him for having to pass a law to force his own government to invest in the National Health Service. But when Mr. Corbyn took credit for shifting the debate, he was met with hoots of derision from the Conservative backbenches. For all of Mr. Johnson’s efforts to turn the page on Brexit, it still hangs over the country — and is likely to continue to do so. His government will propose bills on agriculture, fisheries and trade — areas where Britain will assume powers now exercised by the European Union. There will be laws to create a new immigration system, which could be in place at the end of 2020 and would remove the special status that citizens of other European Union countries currently have in Britain. Mr. Johnson will enshrine in law his pledge to finish negotiations on a trade deal by the end of 2020, ruling out any extension of the transition period. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described that timetable as “extremely challenging.” Analysts say it raised the prospect of a so-called “no-deal Brexit,” which they said would be economically disastrous. In Britain’s topsy-turvy year, when conventions were shattered and norms discarded, the ceremony on Thursday was a return to the reassuring rituals. Members of the House of Commons were summoned to the House of Lords by the Lady Usher of the Black Rod, who banged her staff on the door after the lawmakers had, by custom, slammed it in her face. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Corbyn walked together between the chambers, the prime minister making a cheerful effort to engage his defeated rival while the Labour leader studiously ignored him. But the queen, having gone through the entire exercise two months earlier, was not keen to repeat every part of it. Since October, she has had her own turmoil to deal with: the suspension of her second son, Prince Andrew, from his public duties after a storm of outrage over an interview he gave to the BBC about his relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. She will next address the British people on Christmas Day.']","To deliver what British prime minister Boris Johnson calls the “people’s priorities,” sharp spending increases are promised for health care and the police.

Son of Spies Whose Case Inspired ‘The Americans’ Can Become Canadian,2019-12-19,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — It has all the makings of a Cold War drama: Russian sleeper spies posing as a suburban family in North America, children who say they were oblivious their parents were Russian agents and an elaborate F.B.I. operation unmasking the shadowy ruse. On Thursday, Canada’s Supreme Court ruled that the younger son of real-life Russian spies who helped inspire the television series “The Americans” is entitled to Canadian citizenship, after a protracted legal battle in which he argued that children should not be punished for the sins of their parents. The case centers on Toronto-born Alexander Vavilov, now 25, who returned to Russia with his brother, Timothy, after their parents — Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova — were unmasked as spies and arrested by F.B.I. agents in the United States in 2010. The arrests were part of the unraveling of a Russian espionage ring that had used high-tech gadgetry and detailed cover stories to collect political gossip and policy talk about the United States. Under Canadian law, people born in Canada have the right to Canadian citizenship with rare exceptions, including if they are children born to diplomatic officers or employees of a foreign government. The legal battle began in 2010, when Alexander Vavilov’s application to renew his Canadian passport was denied. His Canadian citizenship was later revoked by immigration authorities on the grounds that his parents were employees of Russia who had been in Canada for espionage. In 2016, after a Canadian lower court upheld the immigration officials’ decision, Mr. Vavilov won an appeal at a higher court. Then, the Canadian government appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, the highest legal authority. In its ruling on Thursday the Supreme Court said it was unreasonable to apply the exception to the right of citizenship by birth to Mr. Vavilov given that his parents were not consular or diplomatic officials who had enjoyed immunity or privileges under Canadian law. Mr. Vavilov “did not know that his parents were not who they claimed to be,” the court wrote. “He believed that he was a Canadian citizen by birth, he lived and identified as a Canadian, and he held a Canadian passport.” “The relief I feel is indescribable,” Mr. Vavilov said in a statement read by his lawyer. “I can finally take a deep breath and relax knowing that my citizenship is secure and no longer the subject of attacks and doubts. It is a recognition that not only do I feel Canadian but I am Canadian in eyes of the law.” Hadayt Nazami, Mr. Vavilov’s lawyer, said the brothers had the right to Canadian citizenship since they were innocent victims who were unaware their parents were working as spies. Moreover, he said their parents were not officially working for the Russian government when they were in Canada. “These are innocent people caught up in this bigger game between superpowers,” he said by phone. “At the time they were children. We do not use citizenship laws to try to punish people for something their parents have done.” The back story of the Vavilov family is the stuff of a spy thriller — which it helped inspire with “The Americans.”   After being trained in Russia, Mr. Vavilov’s parents moved to Toronto, where they took on the names of Canadians who had died as infants — Tracey Lee Ann Foley and Donald Howard Heathfield. The couple started a successful diaper business and had two boys — Timothy in 1990 and Alexander in 1994. After a period of living in France, the family moved to the United States in 1999, and eventually lived in Cambridge, Mass., where Mr. Bezrukov undertook graduate work at Harvard. But the couple were being monitored by the F.B.I. as part of a sprawling Russian spy ring that had rigorous training and undercover identities and included sleeper spies in Yonkers, N.Y., Manhattan, New Jersey, Boston and Virginia. The couple pleaded guilty to spying for Russia and returned to Russia as part of a swap with American spies arrested in Russia. In an affidavit submitted to one of the Canadian courts, Alexander Vavilov said he had grown up believing he was Canadian, had learned French and English in deference to his Canadian heritage, and had been shocked and “traumatized” to discover that his parents were spies. “I remember vividly the F.B.I. agents entering our house with weapons as I walked down the stairs,” he wrote.  “My parents were handcuffed in front of my eyes. Canada will always be my home,” he added. “It is the only culture I can associate with, and has been a cornerstone of my identity.”']",Canada’s highest court ruled that the son of the Russian spies whose story helped inspire a hit TV series is entitled to citizenship.
"As Modi Pushes Hindu Agenda, a Secular India Fights Back",2019-12-20,By Maria Abi-Habib and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — Wearing Muslim skullcaps, colorful turbans of Indian Sikhs or hip beanies of secular university students, thousands protested at the largest mosque in India’s capital on Friday, a turbulent scene that played out in multiple cities across the country. They defied government curfews, internet shutdowns and the divisive politics that have kept them apart for years. The unrest, now in its second week and increasingly violent, started over a contentious citizenship law that favors every other South Asian faith over Islam. It has since evolved into a broader fight over what demonstrators say is an increasingly authoritarian government bent on dismantling India’s foundation: a secular nation that draws strength from its diversity.  “You just needed a trigger,” said Jasbir Singh, a Sikh information technology worker who joined the protests in Bangalore this past week. “In India, religion never decided your citizenship, and it should not in the future.”  More and more people are pouring into the streets, and many have clashed with police officers. On Friday, six protesters were killed in several towns in northern India, according to officials and the Indian news media, as officers used water cannons, tear gas, wooden sticks and — according to some reports — live ammunition against the demonstrators. [Read: As Trump visits, New Delhi streets turn into battleground for Hindus and Muslims.] Three more were reported killed on Saturday, raising the death toll to at least 17 since the first protests erupted. The protests have emerged as the biggest challenge yet to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his agenda. His governing Bharatiya Janata Party has not shied away from articulating its vision of India as a homeland for Hindus.  Mr. Modi has tried to play down the diversity of the crowds, describing the protesters last Sunday as disgruntled Muslims and saying that they could be “identified by their clothes.” But the anger over the law is widespread, with Indians of various political stripes, creeds and backgrounds worried that one religion could become dominant.  It has galvanized university students, mirroring a pushback against conservative forces around the world. It has drawn in activists, intellectuals and professionals, continuing a long tradition of protests in India.  And it has prompted a global backlash. The United Nations and various rights groups condemned the law, while some American lawmakers called for sanctions. “Those who want to implement discriminatory laws want to do a second partition, as if the millions dying in the first one wasn’t enough,” said Mr. Singh, the technology worker, referring to the bloody sectarian violence that unfolded in 1947 when the subcontinent was split, establishing India and Pakistan. “After seeing so many people protesting in Mumbai and Bangalore yesterday, I feel that old India is still alive.” Protesters are also growing tired of Mr. Modi’s sectarianism as the economy sputters. At the polls, some Indians had put aside their apprehension of the prime minister, attracted to his economic plans. The country’s growth rate has now fallen to its lowest level in six years.  “A lot of people voted for Modi because of the economic issues and corruption. Now, the economy is in real bad shape and corruption has not gone down,” said Aadhira Gaikwad, 26, an advertising professional who protested in Mumbai. “All he is doing is using religion to hide under the real issues.”  “When the prime minister of this country says protesters can be identified by their clothes, it just fuels the fire,” Ms. Gaikwad added. “This is what he has done all these years.” For India’s Muslim population, the protests are deeply personal. Muslims have watched the rise of Hindu nationalism under Mr. Modi with a wary eye.  Dozens of Muslims have been lynched by angry Hindu mobs, with the perpetrators often walking free. The country’s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, was stripped of its autonomy in August, and thousands of young men and elected politicians were detained without being charged. And the Supreme Court, in a case known as “Ayodhya,” ruled that a temple could be built at the site where a centuries-old mosque once stood before a Hindu mob tore it down. Until now, Muslims had largely remained quiet, hoping that sectarian relations could be restored. But when the government passed the citizenship law this month, many felt they had to mobilize or risk losing even more.  “We are at a tipping point now,” said Mohammad Abduzar, 26, from Merut in Uttar Pradesh State. “When Kashmir happened, when Ayodhya happened, no one questioned our citizenship. We were still first-class citizens. But how much longer do we have? How much further can this government push the envelope?”  Many Muslims fear that they could be stripped of their nationality because of changes the Modi government is making. Along with the new law, the government plans to expand a citizenship test used in Assam State to other states. When the test was applied this fall in Assam State, about two million of its 33 million people failed, many of them Muslim. If expanded, those tests would force Indians to produce land deeds, birth certificates and other documents to prove their lineage in the country, which could be difficult for many people who do not always have such records.  Under the new law, Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsees, Buddhists and Jains would have an expedited path to citizenship even if they fail the citizenship test. But Muslims, India’s second largest religious group, at 200 million, would not have the same legal protection. For Mr. Abduzar, panic recently set in when he and his father, Ahmad, realized that their names were misspelled on a school certificate and a passport. For years they had viewed the mistakes as nothing more than a nuisance, so commonplace that even bureaucrats dismissed the errors as the sloppy work of government clerks. Now, such blunders could render them stateless.  India’s traditionally liberal-minded Supreme Court has agreed to hear more than four dozen challenges to the constitutionality of the law granting exemptions to certain religions. In the past, the court has thrown out many restrictive social policies, like a ban on gay sex, and has guarded privacy concerns. Critics say the citizenship law is unconstitutional because it discriminates based on religion, stripping away the state’s secular foundation.  Taken aback by the robust opposition, the government has tried to tamp down worries, insisting that Indian Muslims would not lose their nationality and that the law was aimed at providing a haven for persecuted religious minorities in neighboring countries. The citizenship test is necessary, the government says, to identify undocumented immigrants and ensure the country’s security.  “It is hypocritical for the government to be offering safety to religious minorities they say are persecuted, when they discriminate against their own, against Indian Muslims,” said Akhtarista Ansari, a 19-year-old university student in Delhi who is Muslim and was part of the protests this week. Their criticism is rooted in the ideologies of Mr. Modi’s base. Officials in his party, the B.J.P., and its powerful affiliates believe that minorities have been granted special protections at the expense of the country’s Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of the overall population of 1.3 billion. Many right-wing Hindus hold particular animosity for Muslims, as they were ruled for several centuries by the Mughal Muslim empire. Sharad Sharma, a leader of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, an organization affiliated with the B.J.P. and classified by the Central Intelligence Agency as a Hindu militant group, said the days when the Indian government would appease the country’s minorities were over. “Everyone living in India is a Hindu, including Muslims and Christians,” Mr. Sharma said, voicing a common right-wing refrain that all Indians were Hindus until they were forcefully converted. “They have to be subservient to Hindus and Hinduism,” he added. In this environment, conservative Hindus feel increasingly empowered. When a Muslim was hired to teach Sanskrit at Banaras Hindu University, Hindu students protested, saying that it was improper for a Muslim to teach the primary liturgical language of Hinduism. After another professor at the university, Shanti Lal Salvi, spoke in that instructor’s defense, he was attacked by students and had to flee the campus for his safety. “There is a piousness everywhere, it is spreading and it is becoming very difficult to live in this atmosphere,” said Mr. Salvi, a Hindu. “This university was once considered a melting pot of ideas.”  “This kind of hatred now has an official sanction,” he said, “and it will only get stronger with every passing day.” The wave of protests around India has left the government unprepared, and security forces have resorted to heavy-handed tactics to quell the demonstrations.  Hundreds have been detained. Opposition politicians and activists were arrested as they staged peaceful protests on Friday outside the house of Amit Shah, Mr. Modi’s right-hand man and the country’s powerful home minister, overseeing domestic security.  In an episode that was captured on video and disseminated widely on social media, five female students at Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University rescued an unarmed male student the police were beating with wooden sticks last weekend.  While right-wing Hindus and governing party officials tried to paint the female students as radical Islamists, they conspicuously omitted that one was a Hindu. That student, Chandra Yadav, 20, studies Hindi literature and, like other secular Indians, also protested in opposition to the citizenship bill. “This fight is not about Ram or Allah,” Ms. Yadav said, referring to a Hindu deity. “This fight is for a state that is supposed to be for everyone, Hindu or Muslim,” she added. “As much as this country belongs to me, it belongs to Muslims.” Jeffrey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.

Gandhi Biographer Arrested as Protests Over Citizenship Law Sweep India,2019-12-19,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI —\xa0Rowdy protests against a contentious new citizenship law swept India on Thursday, and the authorities responded by shutting down the internet, barricading roads and arresting hundreds of protesters, revealing an Indian government increasingly on edge. In Bangalore, Ramachandra Guha, a pre-eminent biographer of Mohandas K. Gandhi and a critic of the citizenship law, was midsentence in speaking to a reporter when helmeted police officers carrying sticks grabbed his arms and dragged him away. It was all captured on video. “Our protest is totally nonviolent,” Mr. Guha said, seconds before he was detained. “See what is happening. You see we are totally peaceful. Did you see any violence?”  Mr. Guha was then put into a bus full of other detainees. He was released later in the day.  The Indian news media reported that three people were killed during protests, two in Mangalore and one in Lucknow. In New Delhi, the capital, demonstrators flocked to the historic Red Fort, chanting, “We want freedom!” and “The person who will walk the path of Hitler will die the death of Hitler!” Anger, energy and opposition to the government are growing by the day. More and more Indians are pouring onto the streets of major cities, from Kolkata in the east to Kochi in the south, to express outrage at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government for pushing through a law that favors granting citizenship to South Asians of faiths other than Islam. The government has responded to this week’s protests with riot officers and internet shutdowns. India tops the world — by far — in the number of digital lockdowns it has imposed, outpacing authoritarian governments such as those of Syria and Turkey. [Read: As Modi pushes a Hindu nationalist agenda, a secular India is fighting back.] Police officials in Delhi said they had detained hundreds of people and converted a sports stadium into a temporary jail, though the Indian news media said that many of the at least 300 people arrested were later released.  India’s Muslims, a minority in this vast country but, at 200 million, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, have weathered an increasingly nasty campaign of abuse and discrimination on Mr. Modi’s watch.  Though Mr. Modi has denied any anti-Muslim bias, his political party is deeply rooted in a worldview that celebrates India as a homeland for Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of the country’s population.  Many members of his Bharatiya Janata Party, including high-ranking officials, have uttered discriminatory comments about Muslims and even celebrated thugs who have beaten up or killed them. Mob lynchings of Muslims have increased in recent years as Mr. Modi’s party has dominated politics. This week, the resentment in the country’s Muslim population finally erupted. Tens of thousands of Muslims and Indians of other faiths have demonstrated against the new Citizenship Amendment Act, a core piece of Mr. Modi’s agenda.  The act creates a special path for citizenship for migrants from some of India’s neighboring countries if they are Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsee or Jain — in short, followers of any major religion in South Asia, bar one: Islam.  Many Muslims and progressive Indians call the law a dangerous step toward marginalizing an already fearful community and a blatant violation of India’s long commitment to secularism and equality, which is enshrined in its Constitution.  And many fear that it may be just the beginning.  Amit Shah, the home minister and Mr. Modi’s right-hand man, has vowed to expand a contentious citizenship review process that has already left nearly two million people from one state in northeastern India potentially without a country.  Mr. Shah and other party officials have said the policy is not intended to discriminate against Indian Muslims. Rather, they say, it is needed to expel illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, India’s poorer, predominantly Muslim neighbor.  Many people believe that if the citizenship review goes nationwide, as Mr. Shah has repeatedly promised, it could strip many Indians of citizenship if they cannot produce the required documents, such as old birth certificates or real estate deeds.  Mr. Modi’s opponents say that the combination of the Citizenship Amendment Act, referred to as the C.A.A., and the citizenship review process — called the National Register of Citizens, or N.R.C. — could take away Muslims’ rights while allowing Hindus and followers of other faiths to stay in the country, with all legal protections. In the past 10 days, several people have been killed or badly injured in protests against the government. Dozens of university students in New Delhi were beaten by police officers wielding wooden poles. Hundreds of people have been detained, including Yogendra Yadav, a well-known political commentator, Umar Khalid, a social activist, and several opposition politicians. The authorities in New Delhi shut down the internet in several areas on Thursday, something that longtime residents of the capital said they could not remember happening before. Local officials shut down service to more than a dozen subway stations, and several school closings were announced for Friday.  On Thursday, Indian officials issued a statement that tried to defang the rising criticism of the citizenship measures. “No Indian citizen of any religion needs to worry at all either about C.A.A. or N.R.C.,” it said.  But the statement also made a national citizenship review sound like a fait accompli. “When N.R.C. comes, will I have to provide details of birth of parents etc. to prove my Indian citizenship?” read the statement, which was in question-and-answer format.  “Details of your birth like date/month and year and place of birth are enough,” the answer read. “If not available, you may have to provide such details of birth of parents.” Hari Kumar, Sameer Yasir and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.']","The scholar, Ramachandra Guha, was among hundreds detained on Thursday, as opposition to the new citizenship law continued to roil Indian cities.

Indian Politician Is Given Life Sentence for Raping Teenage Girl,2019-12-20,By Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — A court in India sentenced a regional politician to life imprisonment on Friday for raping a teenage girl, bringing partial resolution to a case that transfixed the nation and raised troubling questions about the cost of justice for women. The politician, Kuldeep Singh Sengar, had been jailed since last year on charges of having brutalized the young woman in 2017, when she was 17. He was convicted on Monday of luring her to his home in northern India with the promise of a job interview and then sexually assaulting her. The ruling came a few months after the teenager was critically injured in a car crash on a rural highway that killed two of her aunts. The police suspect that Mr. Sengar plotted the collision, in which a truck with a blacked-out license plate rammed into the vehicle carrying the women. A verdict in that charge, and in other cases related to the rape of the teenager, is pending. For months, the teenager, whose name has not been released, maintained that Mr. Sengar, who is thought to be in his 50s, had repeatedly threatened to kill members of her family for speaking out. The teenager’s father was beaten to death last year after discussing the case. Mr. Sengar, who was expelled from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party in August, was serving his fourth term in the state legislature of Uttar Pradesh when he was jailed. Dharmesh Sharma, a judge on the Delhi High Court, where the verdict was reached, said Friday, “Sengar was a public servant and betrayed people’s faith.” The judge added that the case “epitomizes the fear ingrained in the mind of a young girl in the countryside” when “reporting issues of sexual assault by powerful adults.” Mr. Sengar was also ordered to pay a fine of about $35,000.  Mr. Sengar, who denied having committed the crimes, broke down in tears when the sentence was read. His lawyers said that they planned to file an appeal. A person accused of taking the woman to Mr. Sengar in 2017 was acquitted. After the car crash in July, a wave of fury spread in India. Protests gathered momentum and politicians staged walkouts in Parliament, calling the assault a blatant abuse of power. The response evoked the outrage that followed the gang rape and murder of a woman on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. That case set off a national reckoning on how sexual assaults were handled in India, which was named the most dangerous country for women last year by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  This month, four men who were accused of raping and killing a young woman near the southern city of Hyderabad were taken under a bridge by police officers and shot dead in the early hours of the morning. And in Unnao, the city where Mr. Sengar was convicted of the 2017 assault, another woman was set on fire this month as she made her way to court to testify against men whom she had accused of rape. The woman eventually died from her injuries. On Monday, while detailing Mr. Sengar’s conviction, the judge called the woman’s testimony “unblemished” and criticized India’s national investigators for a “patriarchal approach or inherent outlook to brush the issue of sexual violence against children under the carpet.” “She comes from a village, not a cosmopolitan area,” the judge said. “She had moments of anxiety and despair and was pitted against a powerful person.” The other cases related to the rape of the teenager that are awaiting verdicts include ones dealing with Mr. Sengar’s alleged involvement in the car crash; the death of the teenager’s father, which occurred in judicial custody; and the gang rape of the teenager by three other people shortly after Mr. Sengar had assaulted her in 2017.']","The case was a closely watched test of the justice system, pitting a powerful local lawmaker against a 17-year-old from humble roots."
Polish Government Pushes Legislation to Tighten Control Over Judges,2019-12-21,By Joanna Berendt,"['WARSAW — Poland’s right-wing governing party is pressing ahead with sweeping new legislation to tighten controls over judges, despite concerns from European Union officials that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the country’s democracy.  The draft law aims to prevent judges from questioning the independence of peers nominated by a council controlled by the governing party — appointments that, up until about two years ago, used to be made by other judges. It also seeks to punish judges who criticize the government’s campaign to overhaul the judiciary or who engage in “political activities” without specifically spelling out what constitutes such activity.  The governing Law and Justice party swept to power in 2015 with a message of national pride steeped in skepticism of the European Union and anti-immigrant sentiment. It has since made reshaping the courts the center of its political agenda.  The government’s steady efforts to assert ever-greater control over all aspects of the judiciary have drawn harsh rebukes from the European Union and international rights watchdogs, which have accused the government of chipping away at democracy and drifting toward authoritarianism. On Wednesday, Poles protested in some 160 cities across the country to vent their anger over the proposed legislation and to press lawmakers to abandon it. Demonstrators in Warsaw chanted “We will prevail” and raised banners that read: “1956: Stalinism ended. 1989: Communism ended. 2019: Why are you bringing them back?” Poland’s Supreme Court warned that the draft law could pave the way for the country’s exit from the European Union altogether. While such an exit seems highly unlikely, the European Commission took the unusual step on Thursday of calling on the Polish Parliament, president and prime minister to halt all proceedings and consult the Venice Commission — a panel of European constitutional law experts — about the legislation. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned on Friday that the legislation “risks further undermining the already heavily challenged independence of the judiciary in Poland.” Despite those extraordinary appeals and warnings, Poland’s lawmakers continued to work swiftly on the legislation all through the night on Thursday and the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, approved it in a vote on Friday.  The bill will now proceed to the Senate, where the opposition holds a small majority. But even if the upper house rejects the bill, the draft will go back to the Sejm, which is controlled by the Law and Justice party and has the power to make it a law if it passes a second vote, as expected.  As lawmakers were introducing the legislation last week, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Law and Justice and the most influential political figure in Poland, said that the new regulations were necessary because the judiciary in Poland is in a state of “chaos.” “I hope that this project will stop the justice system from blowing up,” Mr. Kaczynski said in an interview with the Polish Press Agency. “Judges actually do not bear the consequences of even their most unlawful and harmful actions. This is a sick system and it is obvious that it cannot work well. Authorities must be responsible. If they are not, then they are evil.” The European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, warned in Brussels on Monday that the rule of law in Poland was being eroded and said the European Union was prepared to do everything in its power to defend the independence of Poland’s judiciary. Hundreds of judges, lawyers and prosecutors in Poland already face disciplinary proceedings as a result of their criticism of the government. Judge Igor Tuleya, one of the most vocal critics who has been the subject of several disciplinary inquiries, took the stage during a protest in Warsaw near Parliament on Wednesday evening. “Today is a challenging day. Once again the fate of free courts is at stake,” he said. “Not only are they trying to gag us, they are also trying to put us in prisons. And if this law passes, they will succeed. And if this moment ever comes that we are gone, please tell your children that once there were independent courts.” Earlier this year, local media reported that a deputy minister of justice, Lukasz Piebiak, coordinated efforts to discredit the judges opposing the government’s judicial overhaul by planting rumors about their private lives. His superiors denied they had known anything about the hate campaign, publicly condemned the action and forced Mr. Piebiak to resign. Ever since Law and Justice started asserting greater control over Poland’s judiciary four years ago, judges have been on the front line of resistance, voicing their concerns. Law and Justice introduced the first changes soon after winning the 2015 election, stacking the Constitutional Tribunal, a top court in charge of reviewing the constitutionality of the law, with loyalists. Soon after, the minister of justice merged his post with the job of prosecutor general, which gave the government authority over the country’s prosecutors. Next, politicians took full control of the National Council of the Judiciary, which is tasked with selecting judges, and moved to purge the Supreme Court of jurists over the age of 65. That would have included the high court’s First President, Malgorzata Gersdorf, who was nominated before Law and Justice came to power and is one of the main opponents of the government’s overhaul of the judiciary. The ruling party backed down after the intervention of the European Union last year, which came in response to an appeal for assistance from the Polish judges. But the Supreme Court spokesman, Maciej Lasek, said that if the new legislation is passed, it will allow President Andrzej Duda to pick a replacement for Judge Gersdorf, who is expected to step down in April. The Supreme Court rules on the validity of elections in Poland and Mr. Duda will run for re-election in May. In 2017, Poland’s judicial overhaul led to it becoming the first member of the European Union to have Article 7 of the European Union treaty invoked against it. Invoking the article, which is designed to protect the fundamental values of the bloc, is an extraordinary disciplinary action that could eventually see Warsaw sanctioned or stripped of its voting rights in the bloc.']",The draft law would punish judges who speak out on judicial independence. European officials say it continues the ruling party’s chipping away at Poland’s democracy.
Deadly Gunfire at Russia Spy Agency’s Moscow Headquarters,2019-12-19,By Andrew Higgins and Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — Shooting erupted near the fortresslike headquarters of Russia’s Federal Security Service in central Moscow on Thursday evening, the spy agency reported in a series of statements that also said one of its agents had been killed.  The agency, known by its Russian acronym F.S.B., said an “unknown person opened fire” near the headquarters and had been “neutralized.” The assailant’s identity and motive were not immediately clear.  The Izvestia news site said that Thursday’s shooting broke out in the reception area of the headquarters, known as the Lubyanka, and that up to three people had been killed, at least some of them F.S.B. employees. The Interfax news agency quoted the Health Ministry as saying five people were wounded in the shooting and had been “provided with medical aid.” The shooting was highly unusual for a heavily guarded area that is home to the vast headquarters of the F.S.B. — the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B. — as well as to many other government buildings.  The area around the building was quickly cordoned off by police officers.  The shooting happened on the same day that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K.G.B. agent, gave his annual televised news conference and hailed Russia’s political stability. Shortly after Mr. Putin ended the marathon session with journalists, which lasted more than four hours, the Moscow night was filled with the shriek of sirens as the police and ambulances raced to the F.S.B. headquarters.  The shooting could have carried a symbolic significance. It happened around the same time as the next event on Mr. Putin’s agenda — a speech he was delivering at an annual celebration held for security agency workers in the Kremlin, about a half-mile away from the scene.  Russian security agencies, and the F.S.B. in particular, have been seen by Mr. Putin’s critics as the backbone of his rule. Their significance had waned following the Soviet collapse, much to the dismay of many agents, but was restored by Mr. Putin with the F.S.B. evolving into a force that is enormous and feared. Multiple videos from the scene, posted by bystanders who happened to be in this busy area of the Russian capital, showed roving groups of police officers as loud gunshots were audible in the background. One police officer can be heard shouting to bystanders to run away. The mayhem came more than a year after an October 2018 bomb attack by a Russian teenager on an F.S.B. office in the northern city of Arkhangelsk. The bombing triggered a nationwide crackdown by the security forces on anyone suspected of harboring hostility toward the F.S.B.  The F.S.B.’s massive stone headquarters building in Moscow was last attacked in 2015 when a Russian performance artist, Petr Pavlensky, set fire to its wooden doors.  The building, constructed at the end of the 19th century for an insurance company and then heavily rebuilt during Soviet times, has been the headquarters of Russia’s secret police since soon after the 1917 communist revolution. It acquired a forbidding reputation as a center of brutal repression during Stalin’s Great Terror of 1936-38, when its basement cells were used for torture and executions.  In the final years of the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1991, a square in front of what was then the K.G.B. headquarters became the scene of frequent protests by pro-democracy activists. In August 1991 they tore down a statue of the first secret police chief after the revolution, Felix Dzerzhinsky.  Since Mr. Putin came to power nearly 20 years ago, the area around the Lubyanka has been off limits for protests.']",Russian news reports said up to three people were killed and five wounded in a shooting in or near the reception area of the Federal Security Service headquarters in central Moscow.
"Where the Police Wear Masks, and the Bodies Pile Up Fast",2019-12-20,By Azam Ahmed,"['BELÉM, Brazil — The masked gunmen pulled up to Wanda’s Bar at 3:49 p.m. on May 19 and began firing the moment they left their vehicles. Two people, including Wanda herself, died on the patio. Inside, the gunmen worked in silence: two in front, shooting unarmed patrons at the bar and in the main room, while a third followed behind with a gun in each hand, firing a single shot into the head of anyone still moving. When the massacre ended, 11 people lay dead, slumped over the bar, draped across chairs or huddled on the floor. Only two people survived, one by hiding under a friend’s lifeless body, case files show. Once again, masked gunmen had struck in the Brazilian city of Belém, as they have for nearly a decade, stalking the streets in open defiance of the law. Robbing, extorting and killing without compunction. Yet they did not belong to one of the many gangs that traffic drugs or guns in Brazil, leaving a trail of corpses. They were cops.  The killings drew national attention to the police militias that have long plagued Belém, a dilapidated port city on the Amazon River. Part death squad, part criminal enterprise, their ranks are filled with retired and off-duty police officers who kill at will, often with total impunity. In fact, the slaughter at Wanda’s Bar was not unique because off-duty police officers gunned down civilians without cause. Such killings are routine. What made this case stand out beyond its brutality was the government’s response: It decided to prosecute.  Of the seven people charged with the crime, four were off-duty police officers — including the three suspected gunmen. “We’ve discovered a cancer inside the police,” said Armando Brasil, one of the prosecutors. “Now, we are seeing just how far it has spread.” The militias operate in the shadows of a severe crackdown on crime by the Brazilian government, which has openly declared war on the gangs, thieves and drug dealers afflicting the nation. Killings by the police have soared in recent years, as a force long known for its deadliness has managed to outdo itself. The number of people officially killed by the police reached a five-year high last year, rising to 6,220 — an average of 17 people each day, according to the Brazilian Public Security Forum, which compiles government data. Police killings may exceed that this year, coaxed on by President Jair Bolsonaro and his contention that criminals should “die like cockroaches.”  The deaths have stirred a familiar debate in Brazil. Human rights advocates denounce the heavy-handed approach as both inhumane and ineffective, while proponents say it is the only way to confront a crime wave that has put the entire nation at risk. But even police officers acknowledge that the official statistics are only part of the picture. There is a parallel form of police violence, masked from the public and carried out by illegal militias that draw their ranks from officers with little patience or respect for due process, according to interviews with militia members here in Belém. By their own admission, groups of off-duty and retired officers regularly commit extrajudicial killings, targeting people they consider criminals, robbers and cop killers without so much as an arrest warrant.  “We’re going after criminals who hurt innocent people,” said one militia commander who, like others, asked that his name be withheld because he confessed to extrajudicial killings. In their telling, militia members are delivering a public service, eliminating threats to society who, they fear, may never get convicted or will simply participate in sprawling criminal networks from prison, as often happens in Brazil. “I’ve killed more than 80 criminals in my time as a police officer,” said another militia leader. “I’m a hero to my people. They love me.” Latin America is in the midst of a homicide crisis. More killings take place in the region’s five most violent nations than in every major war zone combined, according to the Igarapé Institute, which tracks violence worldwide.  The usual suspects are often to blame: the cartels and gangs, the surfeit of guns, frequently from the United States, the paralyzed legal systems. But violence by the state is another important factor in the bloodshed — driven by an abiding belief that nations must fight force with ruthless force to find peace. In Brazil, El Salvador, Mexico and other countries, the use of deadly force by the authorities — and the acceptance, or even applause, by the population for that approach — is so widespread that even the public statistics point to an abundance of extrajudicial killings, researchers say. In many dangerous places, even when gangs and organized crime are very well armed, it is not surprising that criminals die in greater numbers than the police or military they are fighting, researchers say.  But when that ratio is highly skewed — and 10 or more suspected criminals die for every police officer or soldier killed — researchers often view that as a clear indication of excessive force by the authorities. In El Salvador, where the government is battling the gangs, the ratio is staggering — almost 102 to 1 — according to the Lethal Force Monitor, a research group that tracks the rates across several Latin American countries. In other words, for every policeman killed in El Salvador, nearly 102 suspected criminals die — 10 times the level researchers consider suspiciously high. In Brazil, the number is also striking: 57 suspected criminals die for every police officer killed, the analysts found. “We believe that homicides are not a problem, they’re a solution,” said Bruno Paes Manso, a researcher at the University of São Paulo, describing the public acceptance of killings by the police.  “There is a strong belief that violence promotes order,” he added. “And the militias thrive off this feeling.” But extrajudicial killings are often much more than an extreme step by overzealous officers in cities like Belém and Rio de Janeiro, and some militia members are candid about their criminal motivations. To line their pockets, some militia members say they bill businesses for security services, taking in hefty sums with mafia-style promises to keep the peace, or they charge local residents for the right to engage in basic commerce, like selling cooking gas or pizzas. The militias also extort criminals and kill those who don’t pay, operations that hardly differ from the ones they are supposedly confronting. “It became explicit for me,” said a third militia member. “It became organized crime.” Today in Belém, there are hundreds of militia members operating in more than a dozen different factions, often with help from on-duty police officers, according to officials and militia members themselves. And until recently, officials say, the government rarely prosecuted or investigated them aggressively. The government of Pará State, where Belém is the capital, says most police officers “do not deviate from their duties,” but acknowledges that others do. It says it has arrested about 50 officers this year in operations “to dismantle criminal organizations involving public security agents.” The prosecutor investigating the massacre at Wanda’s Bar, Mr. Brasil, has linked the militias to at least 100 murders in the state in the last three years, but he thinks the actual number is much higher. “They’ve killed way more than that,” said Mr. Brasil, who has bodyguards because he is going after the militias. “It’s well into the hundreds.” He took his first life in 2010, a few years out of the police academy, after a gang called the Red Command killed his colleague. He and other officers shed their uniforms, put on masks and killed a dozen people they deemed responsible or connected in some way, he said. After that, every time an officer was killed, he said, he and his fellow officers killed at least 10 suspected gang members in response. If violence was the language of the streets, their message would be the loudest. Residents took notice, he said, and in 2012 a father in his neighborhood asked for help. A man had raped his daughter and was still walking free. He asked if the officer would kill the man, to end his family’s nightmare. When it was done and the suspect was dead, the officer said, the father wept with gratitude and offered money. He refused at first, then accepted it. “It was the first time I felt like a hero,” said the officer. “I felt like an instrument of justice.” From there, it was a short jump to becoming a contract killer, the officer said. Each step away from the law grew easier. Soon, the self-declared principles that marked the start of his militia activity were gone. By 2014, the officer said, he was robbing drug dealers, kidnapping and torturing them when they resisted. His hatred of criminals justified just about anything, even killing innocent civilians accidentally. He said he came to embody the thing he hated most. By that time, he said, militias were operating all over Belém. Some were strictly about killing known criminals. Others were about making money. Then in 2014, one of the most powerful militia members in Belém, Antônio Figueiredo, was gunned down in the street. The militias took his death personally, three members said, and decided to respond. On the night of Nov. 4, 2014, they retaliated, killing at least 10 people. But the revenge was reckless, sweeping up innocents as masked officers unleashed their rage. The officer said he joined a team on motorcycles that went to the Terra Firme neighborhood, an area of mud streets and open sewage canals. He said he watched as a fellow officer dismounted, raised his weapon and fired at a teenager in a baseball cap. The teenager, Eduardo Chaves, 16, was the first person gunned down in the massacre that night. At the time, his family said, he was leaving church with his grandparents and girlfriend. It was shortly after 9 p.m. The masked officer shot Eduardo five times, killing him, while the others watched. “He was a kid,” the officer said. “I knew he was innocent and I knew things were getting out of control. But I was so full of anger I didn’t say anything.” “By that point, I was already hard-core,” he said. “I didn’t feel anything.” The boy’s relatives said they ran to the scene and found his body in the mud. His grandmother, Maria Auxiliadora Neves, said she wept as she collected his silver necklace, his cellphone and the few dollars he had saved to buy his girlfriend a pair of sandals.  In the aftermath, Mrs. Neves began to speak out about his murder, a risk even the police warned her against. She became an activist, calling attention to police shootings across Belém.  And then, it happened to her family again. On New Year’s Day, 2016, Danilo de Campos Galucio, another of her grandsons, was shot, this time by men in an unmarked car, she said. Investigators call that a telltale sign of a militia shooting. The bullet passed through several organs and left him debilitated, at 15. He spent the next four years in and out of the hospital undergoing surgeries. Bedridden and depressed, he tried to kill himself twice. This September, he died at 19, having succumbed to medical complications related to the shooting. “I never paid attention to this before because it never affected me,” his grandmother said, referring to the killings by militias, which she once assumed were justified. “I don’t want revenge. I want justice.” Officially, the police here in Pará State killed 626 people last year — a dozen each week.  That’s more than 150 times the number of deadly police shootings in all of New York City last year, even though they are roughly the same size.  In Belém, the state capital, the people killed by the police are disproportionately poor people of color, as they are elsewhere in Brazil. Nationwide, researchers say, 75 percent of the people shot and killed by the police are black. Those factors — the frequency of official police shootings and the marginalized status of the people shot — add to an atmosphere in which death by the police seems common, almost inevitable, experts say, laying the groundwork for the militias to operate with relative ease.  Over the course of a week, The New York Times tracked seven police shootings in Belém, with nine casualties. This is a snapshot of just one day.  On Nov. 16, three young men tried to rob a clothing store. But the building belonged to a police officer, a member of the elite ROTAM force, known for its military culture and hyperviolence. The officer, who was home at the time, saw the men enter the store on his security cameras and took them on himself, according to the police. As they left the store, he opened fire, shooting two of the men — one in the hand and the other in the head. The officer stood outside, shirtless, clutching a revolver with a streak of blood smeared on his abdomen as the young man he shot in the head was rushed to the hospital. He survived. Less than an hour later, an image of the young man’s face appeared on a WhatsApp group shared by militiamen, police officers and sympathizers. In case he evaded justice somehow, they would all know who he was, according to a person included in the group. That evening, two men stole an S.U.V. and exchanged gunfire with the police as they tried to escape. The officers fired three shots into the vehicle. When it stopped, one of the men was taken into custody, witnesses said, adding that he appeared injured but could walk. An hour later, when he arrived at the hospital, he was dead, with a gunshot wound to the heart, a photo of the body showed. “I don’t know whether they executed him, and I don’t want to know,” his sister said on condition of anonymity, fearful of reprisals from the police. “The police here do what they want.” Later that night, Ramon Silva Oliveira, 18, was also killed. He and a friend were coming home from a party, sharing a motorcycle, when the police tried to stop them, the family said. Ramon, they said, was young, black and had a large tattoo, which officers here openly admit arouses suspicion. But he was no gang member, his family said. He had applied to join the military and, in the meantime, was looking for work. He played soccer well. Medals hung from the walls of his room like ornaments. But that night, his friend, who was driving the motorcycle, decided to keep going. The police fired at the two young men, striking Ramon and forcing the motorcycle to fall over. He died almost immediately.  “I don’t know whether the gunshot wound killed him or the fall,” said his mother, Marlene Silva de Oliveira, folded in grief. “I didn’t have the heart to go and look at his body.” The family held a wake for him the following evening, next to a plot of grass where children played soccer. The arrests began days after the massacre at Wanda’s Bar. Using surveillance footage from street cameras, investigators found the gunmen’s car at a local repair shop.  The owner was trying to get some work done to the car, to disguise it. Soon enough, the authorities arrested four police officers — two hailed from the elite ROTAM force — and three others suspected in the crime. Tying the murders to the police was relatively straightforward. Forensic analysts found numerous .40 caliber shells at the scene, a bullet available only to the military police, a prosecutor said. But a judge in one of the cases thinks the evidence is relatively weak, partly because prosecutors have failed to uncover a motive. In the meantime, the bar is closed, a mausoleum to the events of May 19, and residents remain terrified. Some of the accused lived nearby — and their friends still do. The fear is so palpable that not a single family member of the deceased agreed to be interviewed. Some have moved, others changed phones and those still around refused to answer their doors or respond to messages. But a close family friend of the bar’s owner, Maria Ivanilza Pinheiro Monteiro, known widely as Wanda, contended that everyone in the bar was innocent. They were all friends, partying, and the bar itself was a haunt for lots of militia guys, he said on the condition of anonymity for fear for his life. That’s why the motive is so elusive, he said. The bar had been around for 15 years. They all knew the militias, or were even friends with them.

He believed that rogue cops were the best way to rid Belém of crime.

To them, violence was the only solution, and the only question was how to wield it. “There’s a way to fix this,” said one of the militia leaders. “The governor should call the good cops and let us go and allow us to kill anyone.

"Putin Hints at Holding Power Past 2024, and Defends Trump on Impeachment",2019-12-19,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Just hours after President Trump became only the third American leader to be impeached, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday mocked what he described as an attempt by Democrats to reverse the 2016 election, and hinted that he could, himself, stay in power for many more years. [Update: Putin endorses legislation enabling him to run for president again.] Taking questions for more than four hours at his annual end-of-year news conference, the Russian president embraced Republican talking points, deriding the impeachment process in Washington as baseless and destined to fail. “This is nothing but a continuation of an internal political struggle, with the party that lost the election, the Democratic Party, trying to reach its goal by different means,” Mr. Putin said during the 15th edition of the news conference, a well-worn ritual that the president uses to parade his mastery of domestic policy detail and take swipes at political tumult overseas. Mr. Putin was far less emphatic in his take on Russia’s own political affairs, particularly its next presidential election in 2024. He sidestepped a direct question about his future plans, while raising the possibility that Russia’s Constitution, which bars him from seeking another term, might be changed. Moscow has been abuzz for months with speculation about whether Mr. Putin, who has been in power for 20 years, will step down at the end of his current and supposedly final term in 2024. Wary of declaring himself a lame duck and triggering a destabilizing succession struggle, Mr. Putin has kept his plans secret. His comments on Thursday were so ambiguous that they set off another round of Kremlin tea-leaf reading. His musing publicly about revising the Constitution, which bars a president from serving more than two successive terms, raised the possibility that he may want to run for a third consecutive term — which would keep him in office through 2030 — and possibly more. But it could also mean that he wants to remove only the reference to consecutive terms, which would actually strengthen the two-term limit. That would prevent future presidents from repeating his own controversial maneuver in 2008, when he stepped down after two terms to become prime minister — while holding onto most of his power — only to return four years later for a third presidential term. He also found another way to extend his grip on power, lengthening the terms from four years to six. In an interview with state television after the news conference, Mr. Putin played down the significance of his comment, saying that he had simply answered a question put to him about the Constitution, adding, “I can’t say this was something prepared from my side.” He said he was open to the idea of increasing the powers of Russia’s Parliament, which has become little more than a rubber stamp and cheerleading squad for the Kremlin. A more powerful Parliament “is quite justified in principle,” he said. “But you can’t take rash steps on this and you can’t be in a hurry.” Proud of his role in ending the political turmoil that convulsed Russia under his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin,  Mr. Putin has made stability — his critics say stagnation — the centerpiece of his two decades in power. The contrast between Mr. Putin’s seemingly immovable role in Russia and the tumultuous political fighting in the United States could hardly be starker. The Kremlin, which rooted against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and interfered to benefit Mr. Trump, has watched Washington’s noisy partisan feuds with glee, seeing them as proof that Russia, which has not had a fair presidential election since Mr. Putin took power, has chosen the right path. Offering an analysis of America’s political tumult, Mr. Putin said that Mr. Trump was unlikely to be removed for “highly speculative reasons” by the Republican-controlled Senate. As in the past, Mr. Putin focused on domestic affairs during his marathon news conference, answering questions about garbage collection, airfares to the Russian Far East, doctors’ salaries and many other, sometimes microscopic local issues. The event, attended by hundreds of journalists and broadcast live on state television, has often tended to be more a carnival of flattery than a news event. At Thursday’s event, a journalist from Yekaterinburg was called on to ask a question while holding up a sign reading: “I love Putin.” And another reporter held a sign that said she wanted to ask “about dogs,” a topic eagerly addressed by the president, a dog lover, in previous years. More hard-hitting questions went mostly unanswered. Asked whether he would acknowledge that two women widely reported to be his daughters were indeed his children, Mr. Putin veered off into a long disquisition about the importance of developing high-tech projects in Russia. One of the women named as his daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, is involved in a multimillion-dollar, high-tech development project funded in part by the state. He was more forthcoming about foreign affairs, but stuck mostly to well-practiced denials of well-documented Russian involvement in various misdeeds abroad. He denied that Russian troops were involved in a war that has killed more than 13,000 people in eastern Ukraine, and denounced as unfair and unfounded the World Anti-Doping Agency’s recent decision to ban Russian teams from the Olympics and other international competitions. Mr. Putin used a question from Dimitri K. Simes, a Russian-born American expert on Russia, to riff about American politics and take another swipe at findings that Moscow had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. United States intelligence agencies declared in January 2017 that Mr. Putin had personally ordered an “influence campaign” to tilt the 2016 vote in Mr. Trump’s favor, an assessment that both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump have repeatedly rejected. “First they accuse Trump of a collusion with Russia. Then it turns out there was no collusion, so this cannot be used as a basis for impeachment,” Mr. Putin said. “Now they’ve come up with the idea he put pressure on Ukraine.”']","Russia’s president mused about repealing the term limit he faces, and echoed Republican talking points saying that impeachment was a baseless bid to reverse the 2016 election."
Indonesia Lets Plastic Burning Continue Despite Warning on Toxins,2019-12-19,By Richard C. Paddock,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — The Indonesian government, stung by a report that found burning plastic for fuel is poisoning residents in an East Java village, is allowing the illegal burning to continue while it challenges the environmental study. Tofu makers in the village, Tropodo, who have long burned waste plastic to fuel their kitchen boilers, have seen sales plummet in recent weeks over fears that dioxin, a toxic chemical, produced from the fires is contaminating their tofu. Rather than enforce a ban on the burning of waste plastic, much of which came until recently from the United States, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry appointed a panel of Indonesian experts to counter the report released last month by Indonesian and international environmental groups. At a news conference, officials said the Tropodo test was flawed because it relied on testing dioxin levels in chicken eggs. Eggs are commonly used for testing contamination because chickens effectively sample the soil as they forage and toxins accumulate in their eggs. “Chickens are smart,” said one government expert, Mochamad Lazuardi, a professor of veterinary medicine at Airlangga University in the city of Surabaya. “They will not eat something hazardous.” Indonesia prohibits the open burning of waste but the law is widely flouted by residents and garbage dump operators alike who commonly burn plastic along with other trash. Indonesian officials have neglected environmental concerns for the sake of economic development and one result has been widespread contamination by toxic chemicals such as dioxin, mercury and lead. Dioxin is one of the most hazardous known chemicals and can cause cancer, birth defects and Parkinson’s disease. Testing by the environmental groups found one sample in Tropodo that contained the second-highest level of dioxin ever found in Asia. The Tropodo dioxin study was conducted by four environmental groups: Ecoton and the Nexus3 Foundation, based in Indonesia; Arnika, based in Prague; and the International Pollutants Elimination Network or IPEN, a global network dedicated to eliminating toxic pollutants. Samples they collected in Tropodo and the nearby village of Bangun, where plastic waste is sorted and burned, were tested at laboratories in three European countries. The environment ministry officials and three Indonesian university professors who will conduct the government study challenged the validity of the original test and questioned whether the egg samples were cracked and contaminated externally. The study’s authors stood by their findings. They said none of the egg samples were cracked or tainted and encouraged the government to put an end to plastic burning as soon as possible. “It would be prudent to halt plastic burning, as our data indicates that more plastic burning will result in more dioxin formation and pollution,” the study’s authors said in a statement. But one government official indicated that a ban on burning plastic would not be enforced until it was clear how it would affect the local economy.  “It is clear that open burning is not allowed,” said Novrizal Tahar, the director of waste management at the environment ministry. “But we need to conduct a social economy study in Tropodo.” The findings of the environmental groups caused widespread concern in East Java over the safety of eggs and tofu produced in the area. To reassure the public that eggs were safe to eat, the governor of East Java Province, Khofifah Indar Parawansa, and dozens of members of the provincial parliament stood and ate boiled eggs together at a recent session. In Tropodo, some tofu makers said they would switch to wood for their fuel. “They are upset because the demand for tofu has fallen due to the issue of dioxin,” Mr. Novrizal said. “Therefore, they issued a statement that they would switch and not use plastic waste anymore as their fuel.” But it was unclear how many tofu makers actually made the change. Black smoke consistent with burning plastic continued to bellow last week from many of the chimneys that tower over the village. Several tofu makers who had switched to wood fuel allowed a journalist to see their operations and take photos but many others refused to allow access to their kitchens. Some of the plastic trash burned by the tofu makers came from the United States and other countries, where it was initially intended for recycling but was improperly shipped to Indonesia as paper waste. In an effort to reduce the amount of plastic being burned, Mr. Novrizal said Indonesia has sent 883 containers of foreign waste back to their countries of origin. Environmentalists say that the government’s handling of toxic pollution in Tropodo is a troublesome sign given its plans to build a dozen waste-to-energy incinerators in major cities around the country. Four of the incinerators would be in greater Jakarta, already one of the world’s most polluted cities. Under the government’s plan, the amount of dioxin produced by the incinerators would be monitored once every five years, compared to the European standard of twice a year. Critics of the plan said it would increase air pollution and create large amounts of ash containing dioxin and other toxic chemicals. “Operating an incinerator without dioxin monitoring is like driving with your eyes closed,” said the Tropodo study authors. Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']",The Indonesian government pushed back on an international study that found high levels of dioxin in a village where plastic is burned to produce tofu.
Prince Philip Is Hospitalized,2019-12-20,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Prince Philip, the 98-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, was taken to a hospital in London on Friday as a precautionary measure to treat a pre-existing condition, Buckingham Palace said in a statement. “The Duke of Edinburgh traveled from Norfolk this morning to the King Edward VII Hospital in London for observation and treatment,” the palace said, using the official royal title for Prince Philip. “The admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of His Royal Highness’ Doctor.” The confidential, private King Edward VII Hospital in London has treated members of the monarchy for decades. Prince Philip walked into hospital, the BBC reported. Philip, who has been dealing with a series of health issues and underwent hip surgery at the hospital last year, announced in May 2017 that he would retire from public life. No reason was given at the time for his decision. He was staying at the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk, 100 miles north of London, when he was taken to the hospital on Friday morning. The British news media reported that the prince was expected to remain in the hospital for a few days, but he was not taken by an ambulance and his admission had been planned. The queen arrived on Friday morning at the estate, where members of the royal family gather for Christmas festivities, and it was unclear whether Philip would be discharged in time to take part in them. He missed the festivities for the first time in 2011, when he was hospitalized because of chest pains. A native of Greece, Philip married the future queen in 1947, and was seen in Britain as a symbol of the monarchy’s stability during his 65 years in the public eye. The nephew of the war leader Lord Mountbatten, he served as an aide-de-camp for him during World War II and was later appointed to the highest ranks in the British military, including marshal of the Royal Air Force. He made his last solo appearance in public in August 2017, when he paid tribute to a group of Royal Marines. He resurfaced in 2018 at the wedding of his grandson Prince Harry and with Meghan Markle, now Duchess of Sussex. In January, Philip was involved in a car accident in Norfolk. He was uninjured even though his Land Rover sport-utility vehicle overturned. Two days later, the police gave him a warning after he was photographed driving without wearing a seatbelt. The prince gave up his driver’s license in February, and he was not charged in connection with the crash.']",The 98-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II retired from public life in 2017. 
Where Doctors Are Criminals,2019-12-20,,"['There was the medical student who volunteered in eastern Aleppo even after his classmates were tortured and killed as a warning. There was the pharmacist who smuggled drugs past government checkpoints to cancer patients who needed them. There was the pediatrics medic who relied on expired medicines taken from an abandoned factory.  Each took enormous risks to provide medical care to areas in Syria aligned against President Bashar al-Assad. Some were imprisoned and tortured, evidence of how the nearly 9-year-old conflict in Syria has normalized the criminalization of medical care. Physicians for Human Rights, which has documented the collapse of Syria’s health care system, said in a recently released study that Mr. al-Assad has successfully made medical assistance given to his enemies a terrorist act.  The study is based on interviews with 21 formerly detained Syrian health care workers who have fled the country. None wished to be identified by name, fearing retribution against their families or themselves if they ever returned.  The New York Times independently interviewed three of them. It also interviewed an emergency medic of an underground hospital, the subject of “The Cave,” an acclaimed 2019 documentary, who was so overcome by bombings she abandoned her aspirations to be a pediatrician. The passport clerk said it would take five minutes to answer some questions. “It lasted about 110 days.” By Jack Ewing and Karam Shoumali FRANKFURT, Germany — The Syrian medical students were well aware of the risks when they crossed over to rebel-held districts of Aleppo in 2013. The previous year, two other students had been arrested trying to smuggle bandages and painkillers through a checkpoint. A week later the security services told other students to collect the corpses, which had holes in their foreheads, tongues and eyes from a power drill. “That was a message for all the medical students,” said a former student who asked that his name not be used because of fear of retaliation. “‘If you do something against us, this is the result.’” Still, he and a friend decided to go. “There were no doctors at all in eastern Aleppo. The aerial strikes were really intense. It was a catastrophe.” Today the former student is working at a hospital in rural Germany where the hills are carpeted with vineyards. Two years after arriving he speaks fluent German and is studying for an exam that will give him status equal to a German-educated doctor. He lives with his young family in a quiet village. He told his story in a compact living room furnished with two soft brown couches and a large-screen television.  After making contact with other students already working in east Aleppo, the student and a friend crossed over, pretending to visit relatives. As a third-year medical student, he had few skills, but doctors there taught him basics like inserting an IV needle or stitching a wound. In the beginning, medical supplies were so scarce that surgeons conducted an appendectomy on a young boy without anesthetics. “That was terrible.” Later the situation improved as outside aid groups provided supplies and training. A British doctor taught the Syrian surgeons how to repair a severed artery — essential in a war zone. The medical students visited Turkey to learn how to treat victims of chemical warfare. Despite their inexperience, the students admitted patients and provided emergency treatment because the doctors were always busy operating. The wounded were classified by color code: white for survival without treatment, black for hopeless, yellow or red for those in between. Some cases haunt him. A family trying to escape Aleppo by car came under fire, killing the father and fatally wounding the two children, one cut almost in half. “The mother said to me, ‘Please don’t help me, help my children.’” He lied to the mother that the children were fine, and the doctors treated her. She was the only survivor.  Another time a government missile struck a marketplace and ignited cans of fuel for sale. About 10 people came in severely burned. He and other students pushed tubes down their throats to administer liquids and medicine, but as far as he knows only one person survived. After a couple of months he crossed back to west Aleppo to take his exams. The head doctor at the hospital told him he was crazy — the student had been filmed by a French television crew. Undaunted, he passed his exams and returned to east Aleppo. Asked why he had gone back, he told a story about a mother brought in by her children after a bombing attack in the middle of the night. She was covered in blood and classified as “black” — a hopeless case. But the doctors revived the woman with blood transfusions and liquids, as her children, aged 3 and 6, were curled asleep beside her. The children awoke, overjoyed. Cases like that, he said, “were a motivation for me to go back.” After about another six months, around January 2014, he left east Aleppo again to take more exams. He applied for a passport, because it was getting harder to cross into Turkey and he wanted more training there. That was a mistake.  His name was on a list at the passport office. The clerk said the student needed to answer some questions that would take five minutes. He said “it lasted about 110 days.” The first night he was held with eight people in a cell measuring one meter by two meters. He was interrogated repeatedly and accused of providing treatment to rebels, but he was not tortured.  That changed after he was transferred to another facility in Aleppo, which he described as a large house, operated by state security. For the next 96 days he was detained with 35 men in a cell about as big as his living room in Germany, or about three meters by three meters. There wasn’t room for anyone to lie down. The prisoners sat in rows, their legs wrapped around the person in front. The first three days he couldn’t sleep. The prisoners wore only their underwear and were allowed two bathroom trips daily. The guards counted down as the prisoners relieved themselves.  Occasionally prisoners were hauled out. The others could hear the screams from beatings in nearby rooms. The youngest prisoner was 14, arrested for demonstrating. The oldest was 76, a teacher who developed a foot infection after a beating and died.  Eventually the medical student’s turn came. A muscled guard made him lie down on the floor, hands bound. He was blindfolded and beaten with a braided electric cord. He said the first blow was unbearable. The beating lasted an hour. The next day he was beaten again until he was bleeding, with broken teeth lying on the floor. The guard wanted him to confess to giving medical treatment to rebels.  After 96 days he and 50 other prisoners were loaded onto a bus with blacked-out windows. Guards told them they were en route to the desert to be shot. “I said, ‘O.K., this is it. This is the end.’” But it turned out they were en route to Damascus, where conditions improved dramatically.  He was held in a less crowded cell with a toilet. He got a haircut and was allowed to wash and shave. The meals included eggs, vegetables and fruit.  It turned out his parents had bribed officials the equivalent of about $1,650 to win his release. After 10 days he was freed. Despite his trauma, he went back to east Aleppo. The city by then was under constant attack, and his contacts behind the lines told him the situation was catastrophic. The student’s father tried to stop him. “He said, ‘Are you the only doctor? Please don’t go.’ I went anyway.” After a short time in east Aleppo he left, finished his medical studies and married a doctor colleague. Demoralized by the fall of Aleppo, in 2016 they became refugees bound for Germany. That was another odyssey, including a crossing in an overcrowded inflatable boat from Turkey to the Greek island of Chios on New Year’s Eve and the sale of his wedding ring to pay for train fare from Warsaw to Berlin. Now he works 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the hospital now, but isn’t complaining. “People here are very nice.” “If they find a weapon in your car it will be easier for you than if they find bags of blood, for example, or anesthesia drugs.” By Carlotta Gall GAZIANTEP, Turkey — Soon after the Syria demonstrations began in February 2011, the government started using lethal force against the protesters, and medical personnel were pulled in to help. A pharmacist from Damascus began handing out basic first aid supplies because his pharmacy was in one of the suburbs where the protests first took hold. “People came for bandages and cotton,” he said. “People tried to organize themselves. They tried to set up field hospitals, in houses, to do some managing,” he said. “Some doctors tried to do that. I knew a lot of them. A lot of them were my friends. A lot of them were arrested.” Wary of Syria’s feared intelligence service, protesters cared for the injured in secret, fetching medical personnel to treat them in private homes or safe houses, not trusting the public hospitals where the police and intelligence agents could detain wounded patients. The pharmacist began organizing networks of medical workers. He had experience from his student days when he had raised money to help orphans and the sick. He began collecting drugs and medical supplies from friends, relatives and organizations and getting them delivered. By 2012 the protests had spread countrywide and escalated into an armed uprising. The government had sealed off opposition-held areas including the eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus, the southwest city of Dara’a and districts of the western city of Homs, preventing food and medical deliveries by enforcing a blockade. “The regime was preventing any help for them,” the pharmacist said. “The regime claimed that those people were part of the opposition parties and militias - children, women or men, without discrimination.”  As a pharmacist, he supplied drugs to public hospitals, so he had access to drug supplies and he carried a health ministry card, which allowed him to drive through government checkpoints unhindered. “Sometimes I was trying to deliver very critical drugs,” he said. “We are talking about cancer, cancer affects all people, anyone can have this disease,” he went on. “In the besieged areas it was a very important intervention from my side to deliver those drugs.” He knew an oncologist in eastern Ghouta who had chosen to stay within the besieged suburb, and he sought ways to keep supplying drugs and medical supplies to her hospital. The pharmacist paid government militias to take drugs and medical supplies across government lines, and delivered supplies near tunnels in eastern Ghouta that the rebels had dug. The dangers to people like him were clear, the pharmacist said. Under President Bashar al-Assad — who was a doctor himself, specializing in ophthalmology — the Syrian government arrested medical professionals who showed any sympathy for the popular uprising.  “If they find a weapon in your car it will be easier for you than if they find bags of blood, for example, or anesthesia drugs,” he said. ”Working in medicine was a very critical issue because the regime hated us more than the people, more than the revolutionaries.” Moreover, he said, the government mistrusted medical professionals because they were educated and capable of independent thinking. “They hate the educated people because we are trying to do some organizing that is not in their way,” he said. “They are trying to make all people think in the same way, what Assad needs and what Assad wants, not against him.”  Fear of arrest did not deter him, he said. “It is our choice, our life,” he said.  “As a human, we have this belief, and we have our belief in God, as a Muslim. And it is our families and our people who are being affected.” One of the supply networks he had formed with a friend consisted of 10 doctors and medical personnel. They used basic security, operating in cells, using code names. Only the leader, his friend, knew who the other 10 members were. But it turned out one member was a government informant. They worked for two years, longer than many medical activists, but in July 2014, agents of the Syrian intelligence service detained the group leader, who led them to the pharmacist. Plainclothes intelligence officers surrounded the pharmacist outside his office as he was getting into his car. He spotted his friend sitting in one of their cars. They took the pharmacist home and seized his computer, cash, and car, and ordered him to call his wife to tell her to come home. As they hauled him away, he recalled, the couple exchanged glances. “I looked at her — it was a very sad moment,” he said. He was interrogated and tortured with beatings for 60 days in the 215th branch of the Intelligence Service in Damascus. “My interrogator asked me directly: ‘Where is your gun? Why are you helping terrorists?’” The interrogator dismissed his protests that he was a government-approved pharmacist supplying public hospitals. They showed him a fellow member of his network who had been arrested. The man’s back had been broken after he was bent backward in a form of torture that inmates call the German chair. The pharmacist’s ordeal reinforced to him the Syrian government’s weaponization of medical care in war.  “My interrogator told me, ‘We hate you more than the fighters. Why? Because you will treat people, you will treat fighters,’” he said. He was held in a cell so cramped that inmates had to take turns to rest. One sat with knees bent while another stood. Disease was rife that prisoners sometimes died in the cell. A family of three, father, son and grandfather, died one after the other. The father died after interrogation, and the 18-year-old son, who had been arrested trying to buy bread at the local bakery, was so traumatized that started biting cellmates. “He died in the night, and the guards did not remove his body for a whole day.” The pharmacist ended up signing blank papers and his interrogators filled in his confession, inventing details that he had stored weapons in a mountain cave, had treated fighters and knew the leaders of Al Qaeda and other militias. If the government had really believed such accusations his captors would never have let him out alive, he said. “They know I am not like that,” he said. Instead, they took a bribe of $10,000 from the pharmacist’s family to gain his release. A few months later he paid $2,000 for him and his wife to be smuggled out of Damascus and into Turkey. He lives in a modern apartment block in the city of Gaziantep, not far from the Syrian border in southern Turkey, and works for a nongovernmental agency, providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable Syrians.  The pharmacist said he remains opposed to the Syrian government and its enforcers. “We are fighting them, not with weapons but with ideas, concerns and also humanitarian work.” “They focus on hospitals because if they destroy the hospitals, people would give up.” By Carlotta Gall For some, the war destroyed their dreams. Amani Ballour’s ambition was to be a pediatrician. She lived in Ghouta, a large suburb east of Damascus, and was in her fifth year of a medical degree in Damascus when demonstrations began in 2011. She recalls a building sense of terror. Police began checking student’s IDs at the university entrance and she watched in fear as fellow medical students were beaten and detained, and people were hauled off buses.   “That started very early,” she said. “Everyone in Syria saw that.” A slim pale-faced figure in a head scarf and long coat, Ms. Ballour, 32, recounted her ordeal with the calm efficiency of a medical professional as she sat in the sparse one-room apartment she shares with her husband, a civil engineer, Hamza el Hiraki, 37. When demonstrations broke out in her own suburb, the risk of detention grew. “They started to do the same thing,” she said, “I felt very afraid.” Then one day, Nov. 25, 2011, her brother and brother-in-law, both mechanics who were traveling by bus on their way to fix a water pump, were detained. “My brother did not participate in the demonstrations,” she said, “but they took their IDs and because they were from Ghouta they were arrested.” “They disappeared from that time, nine years ago,” she said. “Till now we don’t know.” Ms. Ballour was still traveling to the university by bus, and was already helping to treat wounded protesters in a small clinic in Ghouta.  “It was dangerous for doctors,” she said. “If you helped injured people they would arrest you, so I had to decide if I wanted to stay in Ghouta, or stay in Damascus and study. I decided to stay in Ghouta.” People who knew she was studying pediatrics began bringing their children to her. She handled respiratory and intestinal infections and referred serious cases to specialists in Damascus. When the government imposed a siege on the suburb, conditions worsened. At the beginning of 2013, a woman came to her with newborn twins. They were in good health, but she had no milk. And with no milk powder available, the babies died within weeks.  The medics relied on expired medicines they found in an old pharmaceutical factory, but by 2014 even those were exhausted. “We did not think it would last that long,” she recalled of the siege. “By 2014 we had nothing. I saw a lot of children die with infections, and some died of pneumonia.”  The numbers of wounded escalated sharply when the government began aerial bombardment in 2012. When a hospital she worked in was destroyed by fire, Ms. Ballour began assisting a surgeon, Dr. Salim Namour in a hospital that was dug underground to protect against airstrikes. Their work in The Cave is now the subject of a documentary film.  They trained volunteers to assist in the operating theater, and on the wards and Ms. Ballour was able to focus on pediatric cases. Eventually the staff voted for her to become the hospital’s manager. “He bombed it six or seven times but he could not injure anyone, he could not reach the basement,” she said, not needing to mention President Bashar al-Assad by name. Only when Russia intervened in Syria in 2015 and Russian jets joined the fight, were they able to pierce underground, she said. “A missile entered the basement,” she said. “They destroyed a part of the hospital and they killed three of my colleagues.” Ms. Ballour had just walked out of their room into the corridor and narrowly escaped. “They focus on hospitals because if they destroy the hospitals, people would give up,” she said. “A doctor represents hope for the patient,” her husband, Mr. el-Hiraki chipped in. Nothing prepared her for the devastating sarin gas attack of 2013. “This was the most difficult thing I saw. I had never seen something like that before, hundreds of dead bodies.” When she reached the hospital that night the whole square in front of the hospital was covered in bodies. “There was no blood,” she said. We did not know what it was but people were shouting, ‘Chemical, chemical!’” “I saw a lot of people, most of them children and they were suffocating,” she said. “Some of them were dead and some were dying.”  The patients were foaming at the mouth, had pinpoint pupils and were in seizure. As medics tried to suck out the foam, more foam kept building. They gave every patient an injection of atropine but it was not enough and they had no oxygen. “People asked me to help their children but they were dead,” she said. With seconds to save those still alive, she brushed off a woman whose three children were her patients. “I could not even look at them. They were dead and I had to help others. There was no time and I did not sympathize with her. And when I remember that I feel bad.” “That night 1,400 died, most of them were children,” she said.  The incident made Ms. Ballour and her surgeon colleague, Dr. Salim, targets of the Assad government because they were important witnesses to one of the war’s worst atrocities. They were eventually evacuated in to Idlib, the last opposition-held province in northwestern Syria. But there, they received a warning that they were on a government hit list because of their knowledge of the sarin attack and were forced to move to Turkey. In Ghouta medical colleagues who chose to stay behind were arrested, including a former military doctor, Dr. Motaz. He died in prison. For Ms. Ballour, the last days of the siege, when she saw so many children killed and maimed, many of them her own patients, finally broke her. She is working on a new project for Syrian women but gave up her dreams of being a pediatrician. “I cannot describe it, there are no words, but I could not work,” she said. “I will not be a pediatrician any more. I could not work with the children. Every child reminds me of another child.” “Maybe I could have done more. This feeling of guilt never left us.” By Carlotta Gall GAZIANTEP, Turkey — Dr. Ahmed was training to be an orthopedic surgeon at a government training hospital on the outskirts of Damascus when he became involved in coordinating first-aid points for injured protesters in 2011. With a group of 10 friends in the suburb of Dummar, Dr. Ahmed helped to move wounded protesters to a couple’s private house where he would bring his instruments and medication, and provide first aid. They kept the medical work secret, but at the same time were actively supporting the demonstrations on social media.  “We were expressing our opinions in public on Facebook. I was using my real name,” he said. “That was to encourage people to express their opinion. So I never used a fake name which was crazy in that time.” In August 2011, intelligence officials came to the hospital where he worked and detained him. Unknown to Dr. Ahmed, the whole group was taken into custody at the same time.  He endured a month of interrogation and torture of beatings, electric shocks and mock executions. He was beaten with rubber, wooden and steel cables, and electrocuted in ankle-deep in water. “It was like someone threw me into a wall. I lost consciousness and then I woke up on the watery floor.” Three times his torturers told him to prepare for his death by hanging, marching him out in the morning, and then after hours of waiting, giving him a reprieve. Although his interrogators did not know about his secret medical work, they always took exception to his status as a doctor and his education. “They said you studied in government schools, and it was for free, and the health service is free. So now you are receiving training from the government and receiving a salary, and now you want to bring down this government. You are a cheat,” he said. “They always were torturing me double because I was a doctor.”  Eventually he confessed, was charged with multiple crimes including trying to overthrow the government, and released. Despite a grueling four months detention, he immediately returned to his activism. “A lot had changed,” he said. “The Free Syrian Army had formed, the international community was with us. I felt, ‘O.K., we have hope.’ And the regime increased its violence so I felt it was our responsibility and we should not stop.” He created a network of safe houses to treat the wounded, both civilians and those who took up arms and joined the Free Syrian Army. “We helped all of them. At that time there was no Al Qaeda or ISIS, so we felt the F.S.A. were part of us.” He set up a safe house in a luxury villa just yards from one of the Syrian government’s main military bases. They devised a network to ferry serious casualties to Lebanon. He returned to his post in the government hospital, working by day as a government orthopedic surgeon and by night for the opposition. “Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” he said, laughing. “Most of us had these two lives.” At one first-aid point he amputated the arm of a Free Syrian Army fighter without equipment. He used a simple razor blade and cut the bones with garden shears. “It worked,” he said, “but a couple of hours after we finished, they said that the Army was very close to the center and we have to evacuate.” The doctors could drive out because they had passes, but they had to leave the patient. “He told us, go, and we left and we don’t know what happened to him. It was one of the most difficult moments of my life.” In 2013, he received a warning that he was about to be arrested and fled Damascus for the rebel-held area of Idlib. It was just in time, as government officials came looking for him at the hospital the next day. He joined a small rural hospital, and in 2014 encountered one of the most dramatic surgeries of his life. A car bomb exploded in the market and caused dozens of casualties. He treated a 10-year-old boy who had an open leg fracture, but then discovered his femoral artery was ruptured. As the blood spurted out, he told his assistant to put his hand on the wound and called a surgeon friend in Germany. “He said ‘O.K. I will send you a YouTube link, watch it and then go to the operating theater and call me through Skype and I will tell you what to do,’” he recalled. Dr. Ahmed watched the video, and then his friend talked him through the operation, taking a piece of vein from the boy’s other leg, mending the rupture and watching the color return to the boy’s foot. “Till now, I have never felt happiness like this in my life,” he said. He now works in Gaziantep in southern Turkey, meeting for an interview in a cafe because his wife wants no more activism in their lives.  He no longer practices medicine and describes feeling survivors’ guilt. “Maybe I could have done more. This feeling of guilt never left us,” he said. His new mission is to help train and support medical personnel in northwestern Syria, where there is a lack of doctors.  “I came here to bridge the gap as much as I can, and I think I did good work in that.” Produced by Rick Gladstone and Malachy Browne.']",
"Stuck With an Ex-Husband’s Debt, a Journalist Fights for Divorced Women",2019-12-20,By Amber Wang and Chris Buckley,"['BEIJING — For the first seven months after her divorce, Li Xiuping thought her former husband had disappeared from her life. Then came the phone call that turned Ms. Li, a journalist for a state-run newspaper in Beijing, into a dogged activist for the economic rights of Chinese women. In that terse call, Ms. Li’s ex-husband told her that she had missed a court hearing initiated by creditors who were chasing the couple for unpaid loans — debt that Ms. Li said she didn’t know about. After a frantic trip to the courthouse, Ms. Li said she found out that her ex-husband had borrowed about $400,000. The case, raising a tangle of questions about divorced women’s liability for their former husbands’ debts, pushed Ms. Li into a fight to change Chinese marriage laws. For three years, the button-down journalist has been lobbying lawmakers and judges in a relentless effort that has even alienated some former friends in the cause. “This just isn’t right, I don’t want to see more lives ruined,” said Ms. Li, 49. “I don’t want to give up on this until we’ve gone as far as we can.” Over the past two years, the global #MeToo movement has inspired Chinese women to speak up against sexual harassment. Ms. Li wants to extend the debate to women’s economic rights. She and hundreds of other women, as well as some divorced men, say China’s law has unfairly entrapped them when courts ruled they were jointly liable for former spouses’ unpaid loans. “I shouldn’t be dragged into uncontrollable risks because of a marriage,” she said in an interview in her apartment in northwest Beijing, which she has held onto during a running legal struggle. “This is not just to overturn the decisions in our own cases, but to alter the destiny of more Chinese women.” Ms. Li and other women are now fighting what she calls the “final battle” to change how Chinese laws deal with post-divorce debt disputes. China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, has been discussing amendments to marriage laws, and Ms. Li and many other women have petitioned lawmakers to demand that the debt issue be addressed. Under Xi Jinping, the authoritarian Communist Party leader, China has silenced rights lawyers and human rights activists. But Ms. Li and others have avoided political confrontation and honed a more fluid style of activism, using WeChat, a popular social media platform, to mobilize, coordinate and share advice about handling messy divorces. More women, and some men, have found themselves caught up in similar disputes. Divorce has become increasingly common in China, and as the middle class and private businesses have expanded, growing numbers of divorces involve debts that must be divided up, along with children, pets and homes. China’s current marriage law dates to 1981, a time when divorces and loan disputes were much rarer. Though it has been amended over the years, it still leaves much unclear about how debt should be divided up. In 2003, the nation’s top court, the Supreme People’s Court, tried to offer certainty by telling judges to presume that both spouses in a divorce shared liability for personal debts. That rule helped prevent the use of sham divorces to escape debts. But it left a burden on divorced spouses disputing debts to prove that a loan agreement had clearly excluded them from liability. For Ms. Li and many other divorced women, that attempt at legal clarity has simply created more confusion about how to prove they had no responsibility for a debt. “As long as a debt was acquired during marriage, the presumption was that it was shared,” said Jiang Yue, a law professor at Xiamen University in southeast China. A former husband or wife had to prove that a debt was not jointly held, she said. “But if they never knew about it to begin with, how could they assume the burden of proof?” Ms. Li’s journey to activism began in 2014, after she and her husband, Li Xianghua, divorced. Their marriage had faltered while he was consumed with his automobile parts business and she worked as a journalist at the Farmers Daily, an official newspaper for agricultural news, she said. After the divorce was finalized in 2014, Ms. Li looked forward to a quiet life as a “bookworm,” she said. Mr. Li could not be reached for comment. But a Beijing court judgment from 2016 about their debt dispute said that Mr. Li accused his former wife of paying for their living expenses from his company’s funds.  “Business income was used for the couple’s shared life,” he said, according to the court judgment. Ms. Li denied using her husband’s loans to pay for their living expenses. Ms. Li was born in rural Anhui Province, where her parents were local officials, and during the 1980s studied journalism in Wuhan, a city in central China. Back then, feminist ideas joined the intellectual ferment on campuses, including through a Chinese translation of Simone de Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex.” Fighting on the front lines for women’s rights seemed distant from her routine of filing stories on village administration, rural migrant workers and land policy for the Farmers Daily. But as her former husband’s loans came due, Ms. Li became entangled in several court cases about her share of the debt. Her life became dominated by creditors showing up at her apartment and by visits to courts, to submit paperwork and beg for more time. Her lowest point came in 2015, when she was detained for nine days after she accused a judge of confiscating documents from her. In the detention cell crowded with inmates, Ms. Li staged a hunger strike, drinking only bottles of sweetened tea, she said. “This was absolutely ridiculous. They even didn’t notify my lawyer,” she said of her detention. “I wanted to fight for my rights after I got out.” For Ms. Li, the Chinese internet offered a kind of salvation. While websites can be heavily censored in China, there is space for discussing social controversies. Browsing online in 2016, Ms. Li came across a group of women whose complaints sounded uncannily like hers: divorced and distraught after former husbands had left them buried under debt. “Marriage is risky, be careful when you collect the marriage certificate,” read the online essay that caught Ms. Li’s eye on Weibo, a Chinese social media service that allows groups of users to share messages and links. “If you marry the wrong person,” it read, “this marriage will bury your life.” As she explored, she found women recounting how creditors had swooped in demanding repayment for their ex-husbands’ debts. Sometimes the men had evaded debt collectors, leaving ex-wives to deal alone with repayment demands. Pursued in the courts, some women were blacklisted from travel, or their incomes were docked; some lost their homes to pay off debts. In the course of her fight, Ms. Li said her biggest challenge was a personal one: fear of speaking out about a marriage gone wrong, and enduring the public attention that would bring. “No one wants to tell other people that she met a bad guy,” she said. “In China’s public opinion environment, many people humiliate victims instead of perpetrators.” Overcoming her shyness, Ms. Li became an increasingly determined organizer. She pressed other women to speak out, posting pictures of herself holding up a sign that called for changing the rules on debt in divorces. In 2017, she organized a survey that collected about 1,500 responses from people — nearly all women — who described their troubles with divorce and debt. By then the loose online coalition had about had about 1,300 members, nearly all women, she said. They shared information about their cases, cheered each other as they fought in the courts, and began lobbying judges and lawmakers.  Not all the women took a liking to Ms. Li and her determined ways, and the group was weakened by personality clashes and rifts over how to press their demands. “I think she can be too righteous,” said Xie Xiuying, an education professor who is a member of the group, said of Ms. Li. “She is totally upfront. If she doesn’t like something, she says it straight out, and sometimes even swears. So some people feel uncomfortable.” Last year, though, the women scored a victory when the Supreme People’s Court offered a new instruction, narrowing down the circumstances when divorced spouses could be held liable for a former partner’s debts. That change was enough for some women, who have dropped out of the campaign. But Ms. Li has pressed on, demanding that China inscribe a fairer deal for divorced spouses into a revised marriage law, rather than rely on the court’s instruction. On Friday, an official with the legislature said there had been nearly a quarter-million online comments about the marriage law, and that debt was one of the issues mentioned most often. “In the course of all this, I’ve helped make progress in rule of law in the true sense,” Ms. Li said. “I’ve discovered more possibilities in life.”']","Li Xiuping, a reporter for a state-run newspaper, has helped organize an online coalition trying to change China’s marriage laws.

Malta Murder Investigation Closes In on ‘Mafia State’,2019-12-19,By Andrew Higgins,"['VALLETTA, Malta — Soon after a car bomb killed Malta’s best-known journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, two years ago, the prime minister’s chief of staff had a hot tip for reporters covering the murder: It was a mafia hit by an Italian fuel-smuggling racket. More than two years later, Keith Schembri, the official who promoted that bogus story, is now himself under a cloud of suspicion in the murder plot, along with a multimillionaire businessman, Yorgen Fenech, 38, a close friend who was arrested at sea while trying to flee on his yacht. Slowed down for months by phony leads and obstruction by the government, which tipped off suspects about imminent arrests, the investigation into Ms. Caruana Galizia’s murder suddenly picked up speed late last month after a self-confessed middleman in the murder plot, fearing for his life, started talking. The inquiry is now closing in on what the murdered journalist’s family and many others see as the real culprit: not Italian Mafiosi but what many here call Malta’s own “mafia state.” A mounting public uproar forced the resignation late last month of Mr. Schembri, just before he was taken in, briefly, for questioning by murder investigators. Two others ministers also stepped down. After days of protests in the capital, Valletta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, then announced  that he was quitting, too, but would not leave office until January, a delay that triggered yet more protests. A key witness in the case, Melvin Theuma, granted immunity in return for his testimony, said in a court appearance last week that Mr. Fenech, the businessman, had given him 150,000 euros, around $165,000, to hire the contract killers who carried out the murder. He also said that, just days after recruiting the three assassins, who were arrested in December 2017, he had been summoned to meet Mr. Schembri and given a no-show government job. Testifying in court on Wednesday as a witness, Mr. Schembri denied initiating the meeting and said Mr. Theuma had been sent to him about a possible job. There was nothing suspicious in this, he added, since “there are many people like Melvin Theuma who came to me, five or six every day” in search of work. Insisting he had nothing to do with the murder plot, he also denied leaking information about the investigation to suspects. The spectacle of a member state of the European Union veering so far from the rule of law — especially one whose prime minister, Mr. Muscat, was once seen as a possible candidate to take over the presidency of the bloc — has stirred dismay and outrage across Europe. “I never knew growing up in a small village in Africa that I would ever see what I see here in a member of the European Union,” said Assita Kanko, an elected member of the European Parliament from Belgium who was raised in Burkina Faso and visited Malta recently as part of a delegation of alarmed European legislators.  Sophia in ’t Veld, the Dutch leader of the delegation, said calling Malta a “mafia state” was “going too far,” but added that she had “very grave concerns” about the erosion of the rule of law and the integrity of Malta’s institutions.  Mr. Muscat, under growing pressure to leave office immediately, told the visiting legislators that he felt “betrayed” by his former chief of staff, Mr. Schembri, whom he had for years defended against persistent corruption allegations. He has rejected accusations that the rot extended throughout his government, telling the nation in a televised address that “our institutions are strong and they function.” A former British colony tugged for centuries between cultural influences from Europe and North Africa, the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, which joined the European Union as its smallest member in 2004, is in some ways a victim of its own success. Surging economic growth, particularly in recent years, when the economy grew by more than 6 percent a year, has been accompanied by a flood of foreign money into property, banking, gambling and other ventures, and also into the purchase of Maltese passports, which raised hundreds of millions of euros.  This all opened mouthwatering vistas for corrupt officials, unrestrained by rickety law enforcement and judicial systems that could not keep pace and are largely beholden to the prime minister, who controls all key appointments. In Malta, said Simon Busuttil, a former opposition leader and friend of the dead journalist, “there has always been some corruption. But now it is from the top down.” A deeply polarized political system has reinforced a sense of impunity at the top, with Mr. Muscat enjoying the support of a loyal Labour Party base that, fed fake social media reports about Ms. Caruana Galizia’s views — a favorite lie is that she wanted all their children to die of cancer — often believes that she was to blame for her own murder.  As evidence mounts of potential misdeeds by the prime minister’s staff, even some longtime Labour supporters are coming around to the view that corrupt ties between business and politics and the culture of impunity they engendered are what killed the journalist. “They had this feeling of omnipotence, and thought they could get away with anything,” said Saviour Balzan, the owner and managing editor of Malta Today, and a recipient of Mr. Schembri’s bum tip about Italian fuel smugglers.  Just how high the murder plot might reach became clear late last month when Mr. Fenech, the business magnate who has known Mr. Schembri since childhood, was arraigned in court in Valletta and charged with complicity in murder and two other crimes relating to the murder. He pleaded not guilty. After attending the arraignment and sitting just behind the man accused of paying for the murder of his mother, Matthew Caruana Galizia, the dead journalist’s oldest son, said he had “wanted to grab his head and bash it into the wooden bench.” But, he added, more important now was to get charges brought against Mr. Schembri and others in the government who his family and others accuse of involvement in the murder, either in orchestrating it or covering it up. Mr. Fenech has himself testified in court that Mr. Schembri was involved in the cover-up. Speaking briefly to The New York Times during a break in the court proceedings, Mr. Fenech said the prosecution case casting him as the sole mastermind of the murder plot “is all a cover-up.” Standing impassively before the judge in a musty courtroom hung with a crucifix, Mr. Fenech wore a tailored business suit, gray tie and pressed white shirt. He looked every inch the successful businessman, which is what he was until early in the morning of Nov. 20, when the Maltese armed forces intercepted his yacht as he tried to escape after receiving a tip-off from Mr. Schembri. He told a court on Thursday that Mr. Schembri had regularly passed on confidential information “in real time” from investigators, alerting him that he was a prime suspect, that his phone was being tapped and that the three suspected hit men were about to be arrested. Mr. Schembri denied this in court on Wednesday. He acknowledged speaking with Mr. Fenech by phone the night before the businessman tried to escape by yacht but insisted that he had urged him not to leave and did not know that his friend was about to be arrested. The yacht on which he tried to flee had sailed from Portomaso, a marina, casino and property development built by Mr. Fenech’s family conglomerate, Tumas Group, which holds the franchise to Malta’s Hilton Hotel and owns a string of other assets, including casinos and a stake in the country’s main electricity generator, Electrogas. Unlike Mr. Fenech, whom Ms. Caruana Galizia wrote about just once, the electricity company featured regularly in her writings, particularly after it received a loan guarantee from the government of 360 million euros, about $400 million, soon after Mr. Muscat took office in 2012 and struck a curiously expensive gas supply deal with Azerbaijan, a part owner of the power plant. (Neither the Tumas Group nor Electrogas has been implicated in the murder.) Writing in her hugely popular blog, Running Commentary, a mix of serious reporting and scabrous personal attacks, she reported in 2016 that Mr. Schembri and Konrad Mizzi, the energy minister at the time of the loan guarantee, secretly owned offshore companies. These offshore companies, according to documents leaked as part of a vast trove of confidential material known as the Panama Papers, were set up to receive 2 million euros a year, or $2.25 million, from a mysterious firm called 17 Black, which turned out to be owned by Mr. Fenech. As a pupil in the early 1990s at St. Edward’s College, then Malta’s most expensive private school, the young Mr. Fenech wrote an essay for the school magazine in which he said he would like to grow up to be like Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian tycoon who was then a rising star in the art of mixing business and politics. How closely they had become entwined in Malta was evident from the court testimony of Mr. Theuma, Mr. Fenech’s former driver and self-confessed middleman in the murder plot. He told the court that the businessman first asked him to find contract killers in early 2017, but then ordered him to put the murder on hold until after a June general election. After it became clear that Mr. Muscat’s party had won re-election, he said that Mr. Fenech told him: “Tell them to get on with it. I want Daphne dead.” Mr. Theuma said the businessman wanted the journalist killed to prevent her from publishing unspecified information about his uncle, Raymond Fenech, the chief executive of Tumas Group. Asked at a public inquiry recently whether the murder of his wife was avoidable, her widower, Peter Caruana Galizia, said: “Yes. Without the corruption, she would still be alive.”']",Evidence is mounting that the bomb plot that killed the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia reached deep into the government and business elite.
"In Japan, Iran’s President May Be Seeking a Line to the U.S.",2019-12-20,By Ben Dooley and Farnaz Fassihi,"['TOKYO — President Hassan Rouhani of Iran met on Friday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, as speculation intensified that Mr. Abe’s friendly relations with the Iranians and the Trump administration could create a new diplomatic opening to ease tensions. The two-day visit — the first by an Iranian head of state to Japan in nearly 20 years — came as Mr. Rouhani faces steep challenges at home and abroad. American sanctions on oil sales, imposed by President Trump after he withdrew the United States from a 2015 agreement aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear activities, have severely hurt Iran’s economy. And Iran has faced a growing backlash over its entanglements in the Middle East and its severe repression of domestic antigovernment protests last month. Japan’s broadcaster NHK quoted Mr. Rouhani as telling his Japanese host that “peace and stability in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf regions are extremely important for our country.” Mr. Rouhani also reiterated Iran’s longstanding criticism of the United States over what he called its “one-sided and irrational withdrawal” from the nuclear agreement. “I hope Japan and other nations in the world make an effort toward the maintenance of the agreement,” NHK quoted Mr. Rouhani as saying. NHK said Mr. Abe told Mr. Rouhani that he expected Iran to abide by the agreement and “fulfill the constructive duty for peace and stability in the region.” Mr. Abe also said the Japanese would “try to fulfill our role to ease and stabilize the tension in the region.” Later Mr. Rouhani posted a photo of himself and Mr. Abe on his Twitter account with a caption that read: “Iran welcomes any plan that could boost economic exchanges, especially in the energy sector, and increase oil exports and sales. For our national interest, we do not turn away from any negotiation or agreement.” Analysts said that Japan, trusted by both the United States and Iran, could be well positioned to broker a new dialogue between the two countries, after the collapse of similar efforts by France. Their meeting took place amid other signs that Iran and the United States are looking for ways to talk. Two weeks ago Iran released an American scholar, Xiyue Wang, in a prisoner exchange that Mr. Trump described on Twitter as a fair negotiation by Iran that demonstrated “we can make a deal together!”  And in what appeared to be an extraordinary diplomatic gesture captured on video at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, the American ambassador, Kelly Craft, walked over to chat with her Iranian counterpart, Majid Takht-Ravanchi. While their aides sought to play down its significance, such a public encounter has rarely been seen in recent years between American and Iranian diplomats at the United Nations. Kazuo Takahashi, a professor emeritus at the Open University of Japan who specializes in Middle East politics, said Mr. Rouhani hoped to show with his visit that Iran was still respected and not isolated, “and that he may even be able to get some concessions from Japan or the United States.” Mr. Takahashi speculated that Mr. Rouhani had passed a message to Mr. Trump that “he might be willing to talk,” citing the recent prisoner exchange as evidence. Iran has publicly distanced itself from any suggestion of a quick diplomatic breakthrough with the United States. Mr. Rouhani has said that the purpose of his visit was to discuss the security of the Middle East and to calm tensions in the Persian Gulf. On Monday, Ali Rabiei, a government spokesman, said Mr. Rouhani’s trip was “not related to negotiating with the U.S., but we welcome Japan’s messages and new efforts.” Still, the meeting with Mr. Abe had been requested on relatively short notice by Iran, according to a Japanese government official briefed on the issue. Mr. Takahashi said that was an indication the Iranians had “an urgent, important message they want to give to Mr. Trump.” In Iran, supporters and opponents of Mr. Rouhani were scrutinizing the trip for signs of an opening with the Americans. Many Iranians want a diplomatic solution to the sanctions, as does Mr. Rouhani’s political party.  But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly ruled out talks with the United States as long as sanctions remain in place.   Yukio Okamoto, a former Japanese diplomat and policy adviser to past prime ministers, said he believed Mr. Rouhani’s visit to Japan would not achieve anything but a possible “incremental softening” in relations between Iran and the United States.  Still, he said, the “atmospherics” created by the meeting were important, “communicating to the world the message that Iran is ready to talk.” Previous attempts by Japan to serve as a go-between have achieved little. Mr. Abe went to Iran in June as rising tensions between Iran and the United States raised fears of war. But his efforts to deliver a message on Mr. Trump’s behalf to Ayatollah Khamenei were rebuffed. In a further embarrassment to Mr. Abe during that visit, two tankers — one operated by a Japanese firm — came under attack in the Gulf of Oman, an act of aggression that the United States blamed on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. After that incident, the United States called for an international coalition to protect shipping in the region. But only a few American allies have joined that venture, and Japan is not among them. Mr. Trump has pressed Mr. Abe to contribute more to American military efforts overseas, including a significant increase in financial support for United States forces stationed in Japan. After the Gulf of Oman attacks in June, Mr. Trump complained that the United States was protecting Japanese ships for “zero compensation.”  That has left Japan in an awkward position. Mr. Abe does not want to hurt his relationship with Iran, but needs to balance that concern against American demands that Japan shoulder a larger part of its own defense burden.  In hopes of finding a middle ground, Mr. Abe is preparing to dispatch a Japanese destroyer and patrol plane to the Middle East, where the craft will conduct an independent “investigation and research” mission. Under the plan, expected to be approved next week, the ship and the plane will not enter the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil-shipping lane. Instead operations would be limited to the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman and the Gulf of Aden, where Japan has conducted antipiracy activities. So far, Mr. Abe “is managing to thread the needle between the U.S. and Iran,” Tobias Harris, an expert on Japanese politics at Teneo Intelligence, a consulting firm in Washington, said in an email. The Japanese “deployment to the region will be on extremely limited rules of engagement,” yet “the US doesn’t seem too bothered,” he wrote. Mr. Harris added that Mr. Rouhani was unlikely to object to the mission, as “his visit suggests that Tehran would prefer to keep channels of communication open with Japan.” Mr. Rouhani’s approval of the deployment, or at least his acquiescence to it, would be useful to Mr. Abe as he tries to sell the mission to a Japanese public that tends to be skeptical of military missions overseas.   Mr. Rouhani may also be hoping that Japan will offer Iran some economic relief. In a gathering this past Monday to mark the 90th anniversary of relations between the countries, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said that he hoped Japan — once a major buyer of Iranian crude — would restart oil purchases that stopped after the introduction of the American sanctions, NHK reported. Mr. Abe may be able to offer some form of humanitarian aid, which does not fall under the sanctions regime, but prospects that Japan will resume buying Iran’s oil in the near future are unlikely, said Sachi Sakanashi, a researcher at the Institute of Energy Economics in Japan who specializes in Iranian politics.  Still, Ms. Sakanashi said, it is in Tokyo’s best interests to keep up good relations. Japan is always on the lookout for sources of oil, she said, and “U.S. sanctions probably won’t continue forever.” Ben Dooley reported from Tokyo and Farnaz Fassihi from New York. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.']","As Hassan Rouhani meets with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, there was speculation that he hoped to convey a message to President Trump."
Persian Gulf Standoff Starts to Thaw on the Soccer Field,2019-12-19,By Declan Walsh,"['DOHA, Qatar — To make it to the big game, the Saudi soccer fan resorted to unusual measures. He first flew to Kuwait, where he told his parents he was going on vacation. Then he boarded a plane to Qatar, the site of a major soccer tournament this week. Officially, it was a forbidden journey: for over two years Saudi Arabia has led a strict diplomatic and trade embargo of Qatar, and its citizens are barred from traveling there. But the subterfuge and secrecy employed by the fan, Majed al-Qahtani, 29, turned out to be unnecessary. The bitter standoff in the Persian Gulf has softened in recent weeks amid a sudden flurry of peace talks between Saudi and Qatari leaders. Arriving in Qatar, Mr. al-Qahtani found hundreds of other Saudi soccer fans, all mingling easily with their Qatari hosts, apparently with a wink and nod from their government — the most visible sign yet of a recent thaw between the oil-rich countries. “The conflict is an issue between governments,” he said, sitting in the lobby of the ornate hotel where his sports heroes were staying. “Believe me, ordinary people have no issues with each other. We are brothers.” Qatari and Saudi officials have started talks to end the embargo, which has blocked Qatar’s planes from flying over its Gulf neighbors and shut its only land border, with Saudi Arabia.  Last weekend President Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, attended a major conference in Doha, Qatar’s capital, as did the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who urged the two sides to mend fences. Among Gulf experts and western officials, speculation is rife about possible concessions such as easing airspace restrictions on Qatar, or even reopening the border with Saudi Arabia. All sides stress that the talks are tentative, and there are signs that the Saudis’ main ally, the United Arab Emirates, is far less receptive to softening its stance. Still, the talks are the most promising opening yet, and soccer has already rushed into the breach. “We’re hoping this will end soon, maybe in a couple of months,” said Saud Khalid, a 25-year-old Saudi paramedic, who was in the stands of Khalifa International Stadium in Doha on Tuesday night. “The atmosphere in both countries is becoming more optimistic.” Behind him, another Saudi fan jumped to his feet and held aloft a Saudi flag — an unthinkable sight in Qatar only last summer. Soccer and diplomacy are closely intertwined in the Gulf, where the world’s most popular sport has become a conduit for the ambitions, political differences and intrigues of jousting Gulf rulers. Just as the leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have splurged vast sums on the world’s most expensive paintings or on building elegant museums, so has soccer become the focus of a kind of sports arms race. In January 2018, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, permitted women to attend soccer matches, the first concrete step in a series of reforms aimed at loosening the kingdom’s ultraconservative laws and social codes, such as allowing women to drive and permitting cinemas to open.  Political passions sometimes spilled onto the field. When Qatar played the United Arab Emirates in the Asian Cup last January, Emirati fans flung their shoes at celebrating Qatari players after they scored a goal. When Qatar thrashed North Korea 6-0 in another match, only one supporter in the near-empty stadium was wearing Qatar’s colors: a woman from South Korea. Prince Mohammed has not hesitated to use soccer as a tool to advance his regional rivalries. In September, the world soccer body, FIFA, said it had proof that a Saudi company had been pirating the television stream of beIN Sports, a Qatari state-owned company that has spent hundreds of millions of dollars for the exclusive TV rights to major soccer matches in the Middle East. The furor over the pirate Saudi service, known as beoutQ, peaked in 2018 when it stole and broadcast the World Cup across the Middle East, costing the Qatari company a fortune in lost revenues. When FIFA tried to sue beoutQ in the Saudi courts, it could not find a Saudi lawyer willing to represent it. The competition in Qatar this week, the Club World Cup, is a dry-run of sorts for Qatar’s effort to host the World Cup in 2022 — an immense coup for a tiny country of 300,000 citizens, and one which demonstrates its ambition to use its vast gas wealth to project its image on the global stage. Inevitably, the 2022 competition was sucked into the confrontation between Qatar and its larger neighbors. After the regional crisis erupted in 2017, with Qatar’s foes accusing it of financing terrorism and interfering in their domestic affairs, charges Qatar denies, Emirati ministers called on FIFA to strip Qatar of the World Cup. In London, well-financed lobbying efforts with links to Qatar’s rivals started a campaign that amplified concerns over workers’ rights in Qatar, as well as accusations that Qatari officials paid extravagant bribes in order to win the right to host the World Cup. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates hired a former National Security Agency analyst to hack the computers of Qatari and FIFA officials in the hope of finding damaging information about Qatar’s World Cup bid, Reuters reported last week. The hacker tried to lure targets, including the head of Qatar’s World Cup coordination body, with a phishing scam featuring attractive “World Cup girls,” Reuters said. In recent months, as tensions have begun to ease between Qatar and its neighbors, the change has also been seen on the soccer field. The thaw started in October when, at the 11th hour, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Bahrain allowed their soccer teams to travel to Qatar to play in the Arabian Gulf Cup. When Saudi Arabia beat Qatar 1-0, no shoes were thrown. When Bahrain won the competition, the emir of Qatar presented the team with the cup. After a top Qatari player took a Saudi player for a friendly car ride, a video of the ride went viral. When he slipped into Qatar last weekend, Mr. al-Qahtani and his friend Khaled al-Anqari mingled in Souk Wakif, a popular district in central Doha with upmarket cafes, falcon dealers and buildings festooned with giant pictures of the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. They befriended a 19-year-old Qatari, Tamim al-Marri, who invited them for coffee and dates, and then brought them to his home for a meal. “They are our cousins and our brothers,” said Mr. al-Marri, a military trainee. Such warm encounters are a stark contrast with the early months of the crisis, when Qataris and Saudis insulted each other using harsh language on social media. Now, though, some say they are turning away from social media feeds that are often controlled by their own governments. “I think social media is controlled by the intelligence,” Mr. al-Qahtani said. “Now you see, the language is changing. It has become softer.” While their presence in Qatar was still technically illegal, the two young Saudis were not worried about repercussions at home. If challenged about the trip, Mr. al-Anqari said, “I could say that I went there to support my team Al Hilal in the World Cup.” That evening, they attended the semifinal match between Al Hilal and a Brazilian team, Flamengo. On the way there, a crowd of boisterous Brazilian fans in Doha’s new metro ribbed the Saudis, at one point picking up Mr. al-Qahtani and hoisting him on their shoulders. Al Hilal lost. The young Saudis said they would stay in Doha through the tournament final on Saturday. Once they get home, they said, they’ll tell their families where they have really been.']","For more than two years, Saudi Arabia and its allies have waged an economic war against Qatar.

Husband in Taliban Hostage Couple Acquitted of Assaulting Wife,2019-12-19,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — Joshua Boyle, a Canadian held hostage with his American wife in Afghanistan for five years, was cleared on Thursday of charges that he repeatedly abused and assaulted her after their rescue. In the three hours it took Justice Peter K. Doody of the Ontario Court of Justice to dismiss 19 charges against Mr. Boyle, which included sexual assault, the judge repeatedly said that he did not believe the testimony of either Mr. Boyle or the woman, Caitlan Coleman, who is no longer his wife.  While Justice Doody said the evidence showed that Mr. Boyle had been “cruel, demeaning and controlling” of Ms. Coleman, the judge found her to be a generally unreliable witness partly because of her testimony that she had memory problems and, as she testified, “difficulty seeing reality quite right.” Ms. Coleman said at the trial that her memory issues were caused by mental health problems she began to suffer over a decade ago. “Unless her evidence is independently confirmed, I do not believe it, just as I do not believe Mr. Boyle,” the judge told an Ottawa courtroom. Ian Carter, a lawyer who represents Ms. Coleman, said his client was “devastated” by the ruling. “This case is an example of the challenges that a complainant faces coming forward with allegations of sexual assault or domestic violence,” he told reporters. The couple were seized by the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, in 2012 while backpacking in Wardak Province, a Taliban stronghold near Kabul. Five years later they were rescued, along with their three children who were born in captivity, in a daring raid by Pakistani troops. Because the criminal case only involved the first few weeks after the couple returned to Canada, it shed relatively little new light on why Mr. Boyle and Ms. Coleman decided to enter an unstable region in Afghanistan for a hiking trip. Ms. Coleman, who is originally from Stewartstown, Penn., was pregnant at the time of their capture. At the trial, Mr. Boyle faced 18 charges including sexual assault, forceable confinement, assault, assault with a weapon, administering a drug and public mischief. There was also one charge of assault of a person who cannot be identified by a court order.  Mr. Boyle denied the charges, saying they never happened. Ms. Coleman described a series of assaults, some of which she said had been punishments for not following Mr. Boyle’s orders once they were back in Canada.  Mr. Boyle and Ms. Coleman both testified that he prepared “a list of rules” for her that included weight-loss goals, planning “interesting sex minimum twice a week” and only taking cold showers. “You must ask for chastising every time you think you have failed,” Mr. Boyle wrote on his list, which was presented at trial. Ms. Coleman moved to the United States in 2018 and now lives with the couple’s four children.  The case was the first to be tried under a new law in Canada that allows sexual assault victims to be represented by a lawyer at the trial. But Dawn Moore, a professor of law and legal studies at Carleton University in Ottawa, said that it did not change the fact that “sexual assault cases almost always come down to, ‘He said, she said.’”  Professor Moore said that Justice Doody’s decision would further discourage victims from going to the police.  Lawrence Greenspon, Mr. Boyle’s lawyer, sharply rejected suggestions that the verdict would discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward. “It doesn’t send any kind of a message, in my view, other than when you come to court, tell the truth,” he said after Mr. Boyle walked away from reporters without comment. “And if you don’t tell the truth, then you may not be believed.” Mr. Greenspon said Mr. Boyle would return to court to try to gain access to his children and ultimately custody. Mr. Boyle has never seen their fourth child, who was born after his arrest two years ago. “This is not a credibility contest,” Mr. Greenspon said. “Had it been a credibility contest, I think it was a tie — they both lost.”']","Saying neither Joshua Boyle nor Caitlin Coleman, who were held captive for five years in Afghanistan, were credible, a judge dismissed all charges."
What to Eat and Drink This Australian Summer,2019-12-20,By Damien Cave,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Damien Cave, the Australia bureau chief. It’s the holiday season and we’re hot, hungry and ready for a break — so this week’s newsletter will be short and laser-focused on what brings comfort: food and drink. In the midst of all the news in recent months, you might have missed a few Timesian explorations of such things, so let me be your concierge. Let’s start with our wine critic’s favorite wine moments of 2019, not just because that thoughtful critic, Eric Asimov, suggests some fantastic bottles for gifts or family gatherings, but also because two of his favorite experiences occurred in Australia. At the Carlton Wine Room in Melbourne, Eric ordered a 2017 riesling with the curious name Das Sakrileg, “and from the first sip I was entranced,” he writes. “The texture was rich yet delicate at the same time. It was tense and energetic, stony, succulent and absolutely delicious.”  When he visited the winery, La Violetta, and its proprietor, Andrew Hoadley, Eric learned that the wine was fermented in barrels without clarifying or filtering — a radical approach that produced the name, suggesting a wine breaks all the rules. Another favorite moment for Eric: visiting Luke Lambert in the Yarra Valley, where he discovered Mr. Lambert’s nebbiolo.  “It was nuanced and complex, with a lovely, fine texture and classic flavors of dark fruit, menthol, flowers, tar and earthy minerals,” he writes. “It was the truest combination of nebbiolo and place that I’d ever had outside northern Italy.” If you see either of those wines on the shelf at your local bottle shop, grab a case. While you’re shopping for drinks, you might also want to pick up a bottle of Australian whisky. Yes, that’s right, whisky. When Clay Risen told me he was going to write about it, I admit I was a bit skeptical. But then I bought a bottle of Lark in Tasmania as a gift for a friend, who was kind enough to share a glass or two with me, and I quickly (hallelujah!) became a believer. Many of Australia’s small whisky distilleries are now turning heads around the world, for a reason worth noting: they’re not copying what others are doing, but forging ahead with something new. “The existing cohort, bourbon and Scotch, didn’t appeal to us,” said David Vitale, the founder of Starward, one of Australia’s award-winning distillers. “We wanted to create a modern, progressive whiskey that spoke to the place it’s made.” You may also be looking for something to eat to go along with all that drink. Besha Rodell, our Australian food columnist, has a suggestion: Barbecue. Not that North or South Carolina-inspired kind you can get at a kiosk at the market; not some slathered-up ribs at the pub.  No, what she’s talking about is a new and exciting form of Australian barbecue that can be found at places like Sydney’s Firedoor, or Burnt Ends, another fire-friendly spot run by an Australian in Singapore. Her exploration and explanation of Australian barbecue is an argument filled with passion.  “What if there was a style of Australian barbecue that was its very own thing? Influenced, perhaps, by Southern American barbecue, but more heavily by the Basque region of Spain?” she writes. “I believe that such a style is beginning to emerge, and that it’s far more exciting than the glut of American-themed barbecue in Sydney, Melbourne and beyond.” And finally, one more suggestion: recipes. I officially became an NYT Cooking regular this year, with dozens of meals guided along by the brilliant food crew of The New York Times. So I was especially thrilled with a year-end list of their 50 most popular recipes. Some of them I’ve tried and loved (jerk chicken) and others I’m eager to taste in 2020 (mango pie). This will be our last newsletter until then, so hopefully all this food and drink will keep you busy.

"Hague Prosecutor Ready to Investigate Israel, if Assured of Jurisdiction",2019-12-20,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said on Friday that she had found a basis for investigating possible war crimes by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories. But she is first asking the court to confirm that it has jurisdiction there, which Israel insists it does not. The announcement in The Hague by the prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, came five years after her office began a preliminary investigation of actions by Israel that the Palestinians contended were war crimes, most notably the deadly airstrikes and destruction of the 50-day Gaza war of 2014. “There is a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,” Ms. Bensouda’s office said in a court filing. Ms. Bensouda cited what she called Israel’s disproportionate use of force in the 2014 war  and said other possible war crimes included Israel’s transfers of civilians into Palestinian territories in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank.   She also cited as a possible war crime the Israeli military’s response since 2018 to demonstrations along the Gaza-Israel fence, where troops have killed more than 200 Palestinians, more than 40 of them children, and wounded thousands. The formal investigation Ms. Bensouda is prepared to undertake also would examine possible war crimes by Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, and other armed Palestinian groups there, including those that have been “intentionally directing attacks against civilians,” using civilians as human shields, and engaging in torture and “willful killing,” her office said. Israel is not a member of the International Criminal Court. The preliminary investigation began in January 2015, just weeks after President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, over the strong objections of Israel and the United States, signed the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the court, and formally accepted its jurisdiction.  All along, Israel has maintained that the court lacks jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories. In a lengthy memo published 90 minutes before Ms. Bensouda’s announcement on Friday, Israel’s attorney general rehashed those arguments, saying that only a sovereign state “having criminal jurisdiction over its territory and nationals” can delegate authority to the International Criminal Court. The Palestinians’ signing of the Rome Statute “did not settle the highly controversial question of Palestinian statehood,” the memo asserted. Ms. Bensouda said that she was satisfied the court has jurisdiction but had asked for a ruling anyway, to avoid the possibility that the court could decide later in Israel’s favor on the issue.  Israeli officials erupted in anger that Ms. Bensouda had not dismissed the Palestinian claims. The country’s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under indictment, said the prosecutor’s action was turning the court “into a political tool to delegitimize the State of Israel.” “This is a dark day for truth and justice,” he said in a video. But the Palestinians, while expressing impatience, welcomed the move as “a positive and encouraging step,” said Saeb Erekat, the Palestine Liberation Organization’s longtime negotiator. Ridiculing what he called Israel’s “hysterical reaction,” Mr. Erekat called Ms. Bensouda’s announcement “a message of hope to our people, the victims of those crimes, that justice is indeed possible.” Hanan Ashrawi, another veteran P.L.O. official, posted a statement headlined, “The hour of criminal accountability for Israeli crimes is fast approaching.” She wrote that Israel’s “feverish efforts to perpetuate impunity and remain unaccountable will fail.” And Hagai El-Ad, executive director of B’Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, called the prosecutor’s finding of a basis to proceed with a criminal investigation “the only possible outcome arising from the facts.” “Israel’s legal acrobatics in an attempt to whitewash its crimes must not be allowed to stop international legal efforts to, at long last, hold it to account,” Mr. El-Ad said.']","Palestinians welcomed the announcement, while Israeli officials erupted in anger.

Legal Marijuana’s Unresolved Issues a Year On,2019-12-20,By Ian Austen,"['Just over a year has passed since Canada became the first large industrialized nation to legalize recreational marijuana. Here’s the mini version of the article I wrote for The Times about what it has brought the country: tears for investors, frustration for many shoppers and indifference from most of the public, but few of the widely feared problems. Please let me encourage you to read the full version. [Read: From Canada’s Legal High, a Business Letdown] As is often the case with longer stories, my reporting took me down many paths that ultimately couldn’t be included in the article. But as we mark the first week of legal sales of edibles (if, again, on a limited basis), let’s look at some of the unresolved issues surrounding the legal marijuana market: — I spoke with Monica Haberl, a researcher at the Conference Board of Canada, who studies how employers are dealing with cannabis use by their workers. She compared the fears in the run-up to marijuana legalization with the Y2K fretting of two decades ago. “There was all this hubbub sort of leading up to it, and then it wasn’t really the disaster that people expected it to be,” Ms. Haberl said. “I always have to add the qualifier that it doesn’t mean that there aren’t still legitimate concerns and that there won’t be new ones in the future. So it’s still something worth having a conversation about.” At the top of the list of her concerns are the effects of edibles on workplaces. Smoking remains the most common way for Canadians to get their marijuana buzzes. For employers that’s a good thing, as it leaves a lingering and unmistakable odor on users. (By the way, the smell in commercial marijuana grow rooms like the one pictured in this newsletter is almost unbearable after a couple of minutes.) But, Ms. Haberl said, “from a workplace safety standpoint, edibles are just easier to hide and harder for an employer to detect.” On top of all that, she said, the science is still out on how to define marijuana impairment, something that has become even more difficult with edibles because they metabolize differently within the body than smoked weed. “The science is not there to say ‘one toke for women, two tokes for men,’ as is the case with alcohol and blood levels,” she said. “The science is essentially behind the legislation.” — At McMaster University in Hamilton, Michael Amlung, a professor of psychiatry who studies addictions, told me that defining impairment isn’t the only outstanding cannabis issue on researchers’ agendas.  “One of the things that’s concerning from my standpoint in terms of research is when we’re talking about cannabis use among youth. We don’t know much about the effects of cannabis on the developing brain — and the brain does continue to develop into the teen years and into the early 20s,” he said. “There is some preliminary evidence that heavy cannabis use during those time periods can impact typical neural development, but we don’t understand yet what the potential long-term consequences may be.” He is also dismayed about many claims around marijuana, particularly the idea that different strains offer specific properties — like, say, aiding sleep. “There is a lot of snake oil at this point,” he said. “This idea that cannabis is a miracle plant that will cure all of your ailments is, at least currently, not supported by the science.” Genetic analysis by botanists, Professor Amlung said, shows that there has been so much cross breeding between strains “that those labels are largely meaningless from a scientific standpoint.” But while he had concerns, Professor Amlung was also confident in predicting that there was little possibility that Canada would become a land of stoners, even if legalization led to more people using cannabis. “In terms of it being a scourge on society and leading to the so-called reefer madness, I just don’t see that as being a likely outcome,” he said. — Finally, it’s not clear when the industry will start making money. All of the investment experts I interviewed agreed that we would see many mergers between the various marijuana producers, leading ultimately to a smaller number of large growers. But none of them were willing to predict when the industry might produce the riches it once promised investors. “It has been a remarkable swing from euphoria to where we are now,” Eric Kirzner, a professor emeritus of finance at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, told me. “But it really was a crapshoot then, and it’s a crapshoot now.” The venerable Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York now hosts two dramatic paintings by Kent Monkman, the Toronto-based artist of Cree and Irish ancestry. Holland Cotter, the co-chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote that with the works, Mr. Monkman had “flipped a conventional, disempowering idea of Native victimhood on its head.” SNC-Lavalin’s attempts to avoid a criminal conviction in a corruption case led to the political storm that nearly upended the re-election hopes of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. This week, the company brought the case to a close with a plea bargain. The Cold War was back in the Supreme Court of Canada this week when it ruled that the younger son of two Russian sleeper spies who once lived in Canada was entitled to Canadian citizenship, my colleague Dan Bilefsky reported. The latest installment of the story of Joshua Boyle and Caitlin Coleman, who were held hostage for five years by a Taliban faction, came this week when a judge in Ottawa dismissed 19 charges against Mr. Boyle, many of them involving allegations of assault and sexual assault against his estranged wife. As participation in hockey continues to decline, the sport’s seeming inability to deal effectively with racism and abuse is increasingly seen as a factor. When Gerald W. Cotten died last year, the secrets of his cryptocurrency exchange went with him, locking investors out of about $250 million in their assets. Now, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is being asked to exhume Mr. Cotten’s grave to confirm that the remains in it are indeed his. In a move not welcomed by Canada, the Trump administration is taking the first steps to allow imports of Canadian drugs in an effort to cut American drug costs. There are fears that it will have the opposite price effect in Canada while also creating shortages. Todd Heisler, a staff photographer at The New York Times, has created a haunting photographic portrait of an auto repair shantytown using a 19th-century photographic technology.

"U.K. Security Service Can Let Informants Commit Crimes, Court Rules",2019-12-21,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A British court has upheld a government policy that allows informants of the British domestic intelligence service to commit crimes when it is deemed to be in the interest of national security, in a case that judges said exposed a tension between the rule of law and public safety. Under the policy, known as the Third Direction, officers of the Security Service, better known as MI5, can allow their nonstaff informants to engage in criminal activities when operating on cases of terrorism or organized crime, among others.  Much about the policy remains shrouded in secrecy: The MI5 has operated under the guidelines since the early 1990s, and the government only admitted the existence of the directive last year — even so, officials have not acknowledged any case where it has been applied. Four nongovernmental organizations in Britain mounted the legal challenge claiming that the policy was unlawful.  But by a slim 3-to-2 majority, judges of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the body that hears complaints about Britain’s intelligence services, dismissed the case on Friday, ruling the policy lawful and arguing that MI5 officers could not function without informants who could commit crimes, often while infiltrating criminal organizations.  “This case raises one of the most profound issues which can face a democratic society governed by the rule of law,” the judges in the majority wrote in the decision. They also ruled that the Third Direction policy did not grant legal immunity to informants, referred to by MI5 as agents or “covert human intelligence sources.”  “The sincere hope of those involved in handling an agent will be precisely to prevent an atrocity (or the commission of any offense) taking place,” the judges wrote. The four Britain-based rights groups behind the challenge — Privacy International, Reprieve, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, and the Pat Finucane Centre — said in a statement that they would appeal.  Privacy International’s legal officer, Ilia Siatitsa, said that the ruling amounted to legal immunity, as the informants would be acting with the blessing of MI5, which is under no obligation to inform prosecutors about crimes. “If no prosecution authority is made aware when such a case occurs, then de facto the informant has been given carte blanche to act as they like,” Ms. Siatitsa said in an interview.  A communications officer for the Home Office, which oversees MI5, said in an emailed statement on Saturday that the use of covert agents was essential to keep the country safe. “We are pleased that the tribunal found in the government’s favor on all counts and recognized that participating in crime can be a necessary feature of this vital work,” the statement read. The Home Office declined to comment on the number of authorizations that had been given or to detail the crimes that MI5 informants had been allowed to commit. Several European countries have suffered terrorist attacks in recent years, and the authorities have responded by toughening antiterrorism laws, increasing the budgets of their intelligence services, or making permanent the emergency measures that were put in place in the immediate aftermath of an attack. In countries such as Britain and France, governments have argued that increased security is crucial to avert attacks and to reassure public opinion, while human rights organizations have warned that additional measures can erode civil liberties. On Friday, judges made a direct connection between the Third Direction policy and the terrorism threat. “The events of recent years, for example in Manchester and London in 2017, serve vividly to underline the need for such intelligence gathering and other activities in order to protect the public from serious terrorist threats,” they wrote, referring to an attack at a concert in Manchester in May that year and to two others in the British capital — one in March and another in June. Last month, a 28-year-old man who had been convicted of terrorism killed two people in a knife attack in central London. It remains unclear which criminal activities can be authorized under the Third Direction, and to what extent; parts of the hearings were held behind closed doors, with lawyers for the complainants and reporters excluded. The court also issued a secret version of the ruling, in addition to the public one, according to The Guardian. Under MI5 guidelines, criminal activity “may sometimes be necessary and proportionate” to collect intelligence “that can be used to save life or disrupt more serious criminality.”  Intelligence services conducted the Third Direction policy without oversight until 2012, when David Cameron, then the prime minister, asked a retired judge to oversee the guidelines. Mr. Cameron acted shortly before he publicly acknowledged “shocking levels of collusion” by British security forces in the 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, a Belfast lawyer who defended members of the Irish Republican Army, during the so-called Troubles in Northern Ireland. Unionist paramilitaries shot Mr. Finucane as he was eating at home with his family. In the United States, a similar entanglement stained the record of the F.B.I. over its relationship with the Boston crime boss James (Whitey) Bulger. It was revealed in the 1990s that agents had used him as an informant for decades, while turning a blind eye to his offenses, including murder. He was ultimately caught and convicted, and was killed last year by fellow prison inmates.  Ms. Siatitsa, of Privacy International, acknowledged that intelligence services might have to allow operatives to commit crimes, but she said that the lack of oversight was ominous. “We in no way would like to stand in the way of the intelligence services’ job, which is to protect all of us,” she added. “But we live in a democracy, and nobody is above the law, not even the intelligence services.”']","The service, known as MI5, argued that sources sometimes had to be allowed to break the law so that officers could prevent more serious offenses. Critics say the policy offers de facto impunity."
Gun Enthusiast Is Identified as Russian Spy Agency’s Attacker,2019-12-20,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — The gunman who attacked the headquarters of Russia’s feared security agency this week and killed one of its agents was an unemployed security guard and gun enthusiast, various Russian news outlets reported on Friday. The gunman, identified as Yevgeny F. Manyurov, 39, wounded five other people before being killed by the police in the assault, which took place on Thursday, the authorities said.  While official sources of information have been largely silent, many Russian news outlets and social media accounts known for having connections with the security services have filled the vacuum.  He was widely described in the Russian news media as a loner who lived with his mother.  Ren-TV, a Russian news network, said that Mr. Manyurov lived in Podolsk, Russia, just south of Moscow, and that he enjoyed practice shooting in his free time and did not have many friends. The news network also published a picture of the gunman shortly after he was killed, showing what appeared to be a heavyset man with a full beard. In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, a popular Russian tabloid, Mr. Manyurov’s mother, Svetlana, described him as a private person who worked for a series of security companies. Mr. Manyurov had seven rifles, all registered under his name, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported, and he frequently won prizes at shooting competitions.  The shooting occurred just as President Vladimir V. Putin was congratulating the country’s top security agents in a ceremony at the Kremlin, less than a mile from the scene. For Russians, it carried a symbolic significance in that the security agency, the F.S.B., is seen as the most important and feared government institution.  Its fortresslike headquarters occupy an entire block in central Moscow amid a warren of buildings that house branches of the security service. Its basement rooms were used as torture chambers for its predecessor agency, the K.G.B., and during Stalin’s purges of 1937-1938. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the K.G.B. was split into several security agencies and its power briefly waned. But it was restored to its previous status by Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent who headed the current security agency in 1998 and 1999.']",The gunman was identified by Russian news outlets as a 39-year-old loner who owned seven rifles.

Late last month, that joy turned to despair. The baby girl, Lemina — called Mina for short — contracted measles as a calamitous epidemic swept the Pacific island nation of Samoa. Days later, Mina, just 10 months old, died in her mother’s arms.  “I don’t really accept it,” Ms. Lameko said. “God, why? Why my baby?” That question has consumed Samoa as the epidemic has killed dozens of young children in the past two months and infected thousands more, leaving virtually no one in this nation of big families and communal living untouched.  When measles arrived on its shores, Samoa was grievously unprepared. The government had left the door to contagion wide open, allowing the vaccination rate to fall to a staggeringly low level and putting thousands of children at risk.  The failure started with government complacency,  compounded by a misguided decision to suspend a vaccination program after a medical scare. And the country’s skepticism about immunization was amplified by both anti-vaccine activists and traditional healers. Samoa is an acute example of how unfounded mistrust of vaccines and gaps in routine health care have led to a resurgence of measles around the world. Outbreaks of measles have hit every region of the planet this year, with the virus emerging in places like the United States where it had once been considered eliminated. Worldwide, reported cases jumped 300 percent in the first three months of 2019, compared with the same period last year.  In Samoa, an independent nation that is part of the same island chain as American Samoa, the government has taken sweeping measures to control the disease’s spread after initial delays in the response to the outbreak.  During a mass vaccination campaign in early December, the fear that had washed over the country was clear. Families hung red flags outside their homes to alert health workers that they needed a shot, with some bearing messages like “Help!” or “I want to live!”  That effort has put Samoa on the cusp of achieving a 95 percent vaccination rate, seen as the threshold for “herd immunity” — effective protection from the spread of the disease. For many, it came too late. Over all, 77 people have died in the epidemic, and at least 5,400 cases of measles have been reported among the population of 200,000, though the numbers are most likely higher.  For weeks, families have been holding burials all over the island nation. Funeral homes, used to handling the elderly, are preparing tiny coffins for the bodies of young children and babies, with many offering their services at no charge.  In the village of Faleasiu, the family of Valisa Talosaga, 2, kissed and caressed her body last week before burying her in front of their home. In Vailele, another village, Timoteo Fuatogi, 29, wiped tears with his shirt as a pastor prayed over the open grave of his baby brother. Then the mourners filled the dirt back in with a bucket.  The family, who are street vendors, had taken the child to traditional healers after he contracted measles from his twin brother. He later died in a hospital.  “We worked hard to buy nappies and baby formula,” Mr. Fuatogi said. “It’s really hard for me.” Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans. One person with it can infect 12 to 18 others. Doctors can treat only the symptoms: fever, cough and a rash. Deaths in babies occur from complications like pneumonia. And for those who survive, measles can leave a lasting mark — the possibility of weakened immune systems and neurological complications later in life. In 2013, 90 percent of infants in Samoa were receiving the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine around the time they turned a year old. But the rate gradually declined in the years that followed. “We’ve been slack on the routine immunization,” said Dr. Take Naseri, the director-general of Samoa’s Ministry of Health. “I think we have been quite complacent.” He added, “We never expected the measles outbreak.” In 2018, the immunization rate bottomed out at about 30 percent, on a par with some of the poorest countries in Africa. That year, the country’s faith in vaccination was shaken after two infants who had received the vaccine died — a tragedy that was later attributed to a medical mistake. Nurses had inadvertently mixed a muscle relaxant into the vaccine instead of sterile water.  “After the incident, every parent feared losing their child,” said Taupau Siimamao, the grandfather of Valisa Talosaga, the 2-year-old in Faleasiu who died from respiratory complications after contracting measles. He said the family had planned to vaccinate his granddaughter before the two babies died.  Amid a public outcry, the government recalled the vaccine nationwide, suspending its measles immunization program for nine months as it conducted an investigation. “I had to reassure the population that the vaccine is safe,” Dr. Naseri said. But the World Health Organization said the decision helped create “a pool of susceptible children under the age of 5 years who are now the most affected” in the current epidemic. Even after the program was restored this April, the ongoing criminal case against the nurses continued to feed doubts about vaccination.  Mr. Siimamao, whose granddaughter died, said he believed that the government should have pushed harder to persuade parents to vaccinate their children after the scare. But he does not fault officials for what followed. “We blame ourselves in part for not taking care of her,” he said.  The scare also provided a new opening for anti-vaccination voices, both from Samoa and abroad. “It allowed the speculation and fear and anti-vax to emerge,” said Penelope Schoeffel, a social anthropologist at the National University of Samoa. This month, the government arrested a Samoan anti-vaccination activist, Edwin Tamasese, who has promoted supposed alternatives to vaccines like vitamins A and C. He has called mass vaccination “the greatest crime against our people by our own people.” Approached outside court last week, Mr. Tamasese declined to comment. Another prominent voice in Samoa against vaccinations is Taylor Winterstein, the Australian wife of a Samoan rugby player. In June, she met in Samoa with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of America’s best-known vaccine opponents.  At that meeting was an employee of the United States Embassy. “The reported meeting amongst individuals known for their anti-vaccine views did include a local staffer of the U.S. embassy, but these meetings were conducted on his own time in his capacity as a private citizen and do not in any way reflect the position of the embassy nor the U.S. government,” the State Department said in a statement. The current epidemic, according to the Ministry of Health, began when a person with measles traveled to Samoa from New Zealand, which is struggling with its own outbreak.  Dr. Naseri, the Samoan health official, acknowledged that there was a delay in the government’s announcement of the outbreak. He said it had to confirm the initial measles case with an Australian lab, which took two weeks. Labs in New Zealand were overwhelmed, he said. “I’m not trying to defend what I did,” Dr. Naseri said, “but I had to say with confidence that we have a measles outbreak.” The government announced that there was a suspected case of measles on Oct. 9, then officially announced the outbreak on Oct. 16. A month later, as the death toll reached 15, it declared a state of emergency, shuttering schools and barring children from public gatherings. On Saturday, the government extended the emergency through Dec. 29.  In early December, the government shut down for two days to carry out a nationwide vaccination push, aided by global groups like the World Health Organization and Unicef. The Samoan Parliament is set to consider legislation that would make vaccinations compulsory to enter school. “I’ve never seen as high a level of political commitment in a country to conduct a measles campaign,” said Dr. David Sniadack, a representative of the Global Immunization Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the epidemic is slowing, it has been hard to contain.  One complication is that some parents first take their children to traditional healers, some of whom use machines purchased from Australia that they claim produce water with immune-protective properties. “People go to traditional healers and present really late, and that’s why we have a lot of critical cases,” said Frances Vulivuli, a doctor with Unicef, adding that many babies had been close to death on arrival. In the hospitals, some of the Samoan staff members have worked every day since the epidemic began, even taking 24-hour shifts. Teams of doctors, nurses and other health workers from at least a dozen countries are offering needed relief.  Last week, mothers kept vigil over their children as they lay in wooden beds in the isolation wards. Makeshift toys were scattered near each bed.  For Ms. Lameko, whose daughter Mina once laughed at coconuts rolling across the floor, her time at the hospital still haunts her sleep. As her baby was being sedated by doctors, she whispered in her ear. “Mina,” she said. “I want to be able to hold you and take you home.” She asked if she could hold her daughter one last time. She did not want to scream, like the other parents, because Mina hated yelling. So she sang to her instead.  “Who would have known God chose me to raise and give birth to an angel?” Ms. Lameko said. “But it still breaks my heart that I have to let my angel go.” Tutuila Farao contributed reporting.']","When the virus arrived on its shores, the Pacific island nation was grievously unprepared.

"Suspect in Harry Dunn Crash Is Charged, British Prosecutors Say",2019-12-20,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — An American woman who fled Britain after her car collided with a teenage motorcyclist in central England in August while she was driving on the wrong side of the road has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, British prosecutors said on Friday. The woman, Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, left for the United States under diplomatic immunity three weeks after the crash, enraging the family of the teenager, Harry Dunn, 19, and starting a diplomatic tug of war as British officials urged her to return. The British Crown Prosecution Service said on Friday that it had started proceedings but that it was up to the Home Office to decide whether to formally seek Ms. Sacoolas’s extradition through diplomatic channels. [Update: U.S. refuses extradition in fatal crash, prompting anger in the U.K.] There were no signs, though, that the United States would send Ms. Sacoolas back to Britain. During a meeting between Mr. Dunn’s family and President Trump in the White House in October, Robert C. O’Brien, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, said there were no circumstances under which Ms. Sacoolas would return to Britain, a lawyer for Mr. Dunn’s family has said. The State Department has said that Ms. Sacoolas is covered by diplomatic immunity and will not be extradited. “We are disappointed by today’s announcement and fear that it will not bring a resolution closer,” a State Department spokeswoman said. “We do not believe that the U.K.’s charging decision is a helpful development.” Mr. Trump’s intervention did little to quell the anger of Mr. Dunn’s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn. In the meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump told them that Ms. Sacoolas was in a nearby room and wanted to speak with them, startling the couple. They later described it as a “bombshell” and said they would only meet with Ms. Sacoolas in Britain and on their terms. The lawyer for the family, Mark Stephens, said that Mr. Trump’s team had “left an olive branch on the table for a political solution” but shut down any possibility of Ms. Sacoolas returning to Britain to face charges. Janine Smith, chief crown prosecutor, said in a statement on Friday that the police in Northamptonshire, where the crash happened, had been authorized to charge Anne Sacoolas with causing death by dangerous driving. The diplomatic dispute over Ms. Sacoolas has only added to the strains in a trans-Atlantic relationship that has been tested over and over again during Mr. Trump’s presidency. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain even asked Mr. Trump to help resolve the dispute. But Mr. Trump, who has long shown himself willing to feud publicly with British officials, only caused more problems for the Dunn family and the British government by trying to arrange the meeting with Ms. Sacoolas — and then blaming Mr. Johnson for the idea. (The prime minister’s office later denied that Mr. Johnson had suggested that the Dunn family and Ms. Sacoolas meet in that way.) Mr. Dunn’s family traveled back and forth to the United States in a bid to hold Ms. Sacoolas to account. And British police officers traveled to the United States to interview Ms. Sacoolas as part of their investigation. Sky News broadcast images of the Dunn family sobbing after they were told on Thursday that Ms. Sacoolas would be charged. “We believed, we believed and we’ve done it,” Mr. Dunn said. “We’ve got the charge. This is it.” Ms. Charles could only manage a few words at a time. “Proud that I carried out my promise to one of my kids, the promise that I made that we would get that justice,” she said through tears.  She added, “I would never have rested properly ever without being able to carry out that promise I made him the night we lost him.” Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, said that the charge was “an important step towards justice for Harry and towards solace for his family, but it is not the end.” He added, “I hope that Anne Sacoolas will now realize the right thing to do is to come back to the U.K. and cooperate with the criminal justice process.”  ']","Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, was accused of killing the teenage motorcyclist when driving on the wrong side of the road in central England in August."
Philippine Clan Leaders Guilty in Political Massacre of Scores of People,2019-12-19,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — A Philippine court on Thursday found the leaders of a powerful local dynasty guilty in one of the country’s worst political massacres, in which dozens of members of a rival politician’s convoy were ambushed and gunned down more than 10 years ago. Three brothers — Zaldy Ampatuan, Sajid Ampatuan and Andal Ampatuan Jr. — were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the killings of 57 people on Nov. 23, 2009, in the southern province of Maguindanao. Most of the victims were journalists and media workers, and others were supporters and family members of Esmael Mangudadatu, a candidate for governor, on their way to file papers for his candidacy.  “They shot my wife 17 times,” Mr. Mangudadatu, now a member of the Philippine Congress, told journalists in Manila recently, choking back tears. “They shot her on her breasts, her private parts. Such unimaginable cruelty.” Reporters Without Borders called it the biggest massacre of journalists in history. Even for the Philippines, where political murders are commonplace, the scale of the killings was shocking. The volatile Maguindanao area in the southern Philippines was long controlled by the Ampatuan clan, whose leaders investigators say carried out the attack because Mr. Mangudadatu’s candidacy represented a direct challenge to their power. The clan, led by the Ampatuan brothers’ father, Andal Ampatuan Sr., who died in 2015, had built up their political might by aligning with the government, which used Mr. Ampatuan and his large private army as a militia to counter Muslim separatists and militants operating on Mindanao Island, which includes Maguindanao. There had been threats of violence before the massacre. But Mr. Mangudadatu and his supporters were confident that the large number of journalists and media workers in their convoy — 32 in all — would give the rival clan a pause, witnesses testified at the trial. Instead, a militia unit led by Andal Ampatuan Jr., the patriarch’s favorite son, seized the group and forced them at gunpoint to a hilltop, where they were shot and hacked to death, witnesses said. The violence had been planned in advance, witnesses told the court, and the gunmen, backed by corrupt local police officers on their payroll, tried to bury the remains using a government-owned backhoe. The case involved about 100 defendants, most of whom the court acquitted on Thursday. More than 40 people were convicted, 15 of them as accessories to the killings. Fifty-eight people are believed to have died in the massacre, but the body of one of them — Reynaldo Momay, a journalist — was never found, and the defendants were found not guilty of killing him. His daughter, Maria Reynafe Castillo, said she had expected that. “The main perpetrators got life without parole,” she said. “I am happy with that.” Not all of the suspects have been accounted for. Eighty remain at large and are believed to be hiding in the south and likely still working with the clan, officials say. The national police have said they believe that those not in custody might be hiding in areas controlled by armed Muslim militants. The suspects who are still at large remain a continued source of worry. Earlier this month, a man who had testified for the prosecution, Basit Taguigaya, was killed in an ambush.  “He was supposed to join me in Manila for the promulgation of the Maguindanao massacre case,” Mr. Mangudadatu told reporters recently. “No one has yet been arrested. Are the lives of those who testified also in danger?” Three other witnesses who testified against the Ampatuan clan have also been killed as the case has wound its way through the notoriously slow Philippine criminal justice system. Andal Ampatuan Sr., who was among the accused, died of natural causes in prison. International interest in the case has waned over the years, but Filipino reporters have kept a spotlight on it because so many of their colleagues died in the massacre. The delays led the country’s Supreme Court to appoint a special court to focus exclusively on the case and expedite testimony to speed up the proceedings. “This is justice,” Martin Andanar, a spokesman for the Philippine government, said after the verdicts. “It was admittedly a slow process, but we have to go through it as warranted by our democratic system.” The New York-based Human Rights Watch this week called on the authorities to round up the suspects who are still on the loose, arguing that the families of the victims and witnesses are at risk of being attacked. Phil Robertson, deputy director of the rights group’s Asia division, said Thursday that the verdict “should prompt the country’s political leaders to finally act to end state support for ‘private armies’ and militias that promotes the political warlordism that gave rise to the Ampatuans.” Nena Santos, a lawyer who represented Mr. Mangudadatu, said she had received more than a hundred threats to her life in the past decade. Most of the threats came through text messages, although she said she has been threatened in person, too.  “Name it, I have received it,” she said, alluding to the threats. “In one instance I received a text message at 4:30 in the morning that said ‘the person who is going to kill you is already there at your house.’’’']",A court said leaders of the powerful Ampatuan dynasty were behind the 2009 massacre of a rival politician’s supporters and members of the news media. 
China’s Leader Warns Against ‘External Forces’ in Macau and Hong Kong,2019-12-20,By Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — China’s leader, Xi Jinping, praised the Chinese gambling hub of Macau on Friday for its patriotism and delivered a veiled rebuke to nearby Hong Kong that Beijing would not allow challenges to its sovereignty or the interference of “external forces.”  Mr. Xi spoke on the 20th anniversary of the return of Macau to Chinese rule, a significant event for Beijing as it wrangles with protests in nearby Hong Kong that have evolved into the most direct challenge to Communist Party rule in decades.  The handover of Macau, the former Portuguese colony, in 1999 took place two years after Britain ceded sovereignty of Hong Kong. In the years since, the two cities have functioned as semiautonomous territories with greater economic and political freedoms — up to a limit, Mr. Xi made clear. Mr. Xi’s remarks amounted to a warning for Hong Kong, where protests and clashes with the police have convulsed the city since June. Macau, he said, provided “a gorgeous chapter” in the history of the arrangement China calls “one country, two systems” by demonstrating its fealty to the central authority in Beijing. “The long-term prosperity and stability of Macau will, with firm determination, never be shaken by temporary twists and turns,” he said in televised remarks at the East Asian Games Dome, an indoor stadium near Macau’s glittering casino hub, the Cotai Strip.  He warned that “external forces” sought to challenge China’s governance of the two territories. Officials have blamed the United States, Britain and others in the West for fomenting the unrest in Hong Kong as a way to undermine China.  “The will of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests is as firm as a rock,” he said. “We will never allow any external forces to interfere in Hong Kong and Macau affairs.” Mr. Xi’s speech capped a three-day visit surrounding Friday’s anniversary and the swearing in of a new government for the territory. The new chief executive, Ho Iat Seng, who was elected in October by an unanimous vote of an electoral committee, returned the praise for Mr. Xi and the central government, saying Chinese rule was the foundation of Macau’s fortune. “The great motherland will always strongly back Macau,” Mr. Ho said. The pomp and circumstance surrounding the anniversary underscored the heavy symbolism China invests in Macau and Hong Kong: territories that it feels were humiliatingly carved off by Western imperial powers and only returned to their rightful place in the motherland under the rule of the Communist Party.  Mr. Xi referred to the instability and criminality that consumed Macau in the years before the handover, adding, “Macau has become one of the world’s safest cities.” In the days leading up to the anniversary, state television and newspapers lavished coverage on the territory, citing the rising prosperity of the city’s 670,000 residents, the stewardship of the city’s leadership and most of all, Macau’s loyalty to the Communist Party state in Beijing. The comparative discord in Hong Kong always seemed to hover over the preparations.  The coverage also sought to deliver a message to Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China claims as its territory. Mr. Xi has sought to entice the island into unification with the mainland with a promise of a similar “one country, two systems” political arrangement, but the idea is largely unpopular in Taiwan. Mr. Xi, accompanied during his visit by his wife, Peng Liyuan, a former popular singer, visited government offices and schools and viewed an exhibition at a middle school about “patriotic education” in Macau, which means using textbooks produced in the mainland under strict Communist Party supervision. On Thursday, he also met with commanders and officers of the Macau Security Forces inside the East Asian Games Dome. The coverage verged on hagiography. “When I shook Grandpa Xi’s hand, I felt the warmth in his hand,” a young boy said after his school visit, using a respectful diminutive to describe the leader. “Because my hands were cold, the moment when I held Grandpa Xi’s hand, I felt Grandpa’s Xi warmth pass through my body at once.”  During a gala dinner on Thursday, Mr. Xi praised Macau repeatedly. He cited new efforts to build new housing, a pressing problem in the tiny, crowded territory only 12 miles square, and the passage of national security laws that made subversion against the Chinese state a crime. Hong Kong failed to adopt a similar law after mass protests in 2003 and has yet to take up the issue again, much to Beijing’s frustration. Mr. Xi also implicitly criticized the turmoil in Hong Kong.  Macau’s government and “people from all walks of life are well aware that ‘if the family lives in harmony, all affairs will prosper,’” he said, referring to Macau’s official status and using a familiar Chinese aphorism. “And amiability leads to harmony, stressing unity and consultation, not internal friction.” The central government also offered several new benefits to Macau. One was an increase in the daily limit for remittances from Macau to the mainland to $11,400 from $7,100. The new limit in Macau would match that set for Hong Kong. It had been kept lower because of concerns about money laundering linked to the gambling industry. The Chinese state-run broadcaster, CCTV, also announced that its all-sports channel would begin broadcasting in the territory. Security around Mr. Xi’s visit was intense. The authorities suspended service on a newly opened elevated light rail in Taipa — only days after it opened — and border guards turned away a number of journalists and others as they tried to enter the territory from Hong Kong, presumably because they wanted to ensure a protest-free celebration. Elaine Yu contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Claire Fu contributed research from Beijing.  ']",Xi Jinping celebrated the 20th anniversary of the return of Macau to Chinese rule and said Beijing would brook no challenges to its sovereignty. 
2 Firefighters Die in Australia Fires and Scott Morrison Ends Vacation,2019-12-20,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['MELBOURNE, Australia — Two volunteer firefighters died on Thursday night while battling ferocious blazes in the region surrounding Sydney, prompting Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, to say he would cut short a family vacation to Hawaii that had enraged constituents. The firefighters, Geoffrey Keaton, 32, and Andrew O’Dwyer, 36, had been among a convoy trying to fend off wildfires southwest of Sydney when their truck hit a tree and rolled over, killing them and injuring three other passengers, the authorities said. They were the first firefighter deaths in a fire season that has overwhelmed the largely volunteer brigades battling the blazes. “This is an absolutely devastating event in what has already been an incredibly difficult day and fire season,” the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said in a statement released on Friday. Both men were fathers to young children. “Our hearts are breaking,” the service’s association president, Brian McDonough, said in a statement. The deaths come as more than 100 out-of-control wildfires, stoked by extreme heat and strong winds, continue to rage in New South Wales. The state government has declared a state of emergency, and the smog reaches as far as Melbourne, where it blanketed the city.  Catastrophic fire conditions have also been forecast in South Australia, where temperatures reached nearly 122 degrees on Thursday, and asphalt roads have begun to melt in the record-breaking heat.  With Australia literally on fire and melting, the prime minister’s absence drew furious criticism from other ministers and the public, who this year have choked through hazardous pollution levels in Sydney and staged protests and strikes calling for urgent action to combat climate change. The hashtags #NSWfires and #wherethebloodyhellareya — a reference to a 2006 tourism campaign calling on people to come see the natural beauty of Australia — began trending on Twitter. An actress in the campaign, Lara Worthington, took aim at Mr. Morrison, who has played down any connection between climate change and the fires. In a statement released on Friday, Mr. Morrison said that “given the most recent tragic events” he would return to Sydney as soon as possible and deeply regretted “the offense caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with my family at this time.” Speaking on local radio on Friday morning, he added that, “if it was possible not to be where I was this week, well, maybe. But this had been arranged some time ago and that’s just how it was.”  He said he expected that Australians would be pleased he was returning, but added, “I don’t hold a hose” and “I don’t sit in a control room.” The leader of the opposition party, Anthony Albanese, criticized the prime minister for his handling of the fires and suggested that volunteers should be compensated for the increasingly strenuous work that was being expected from them as fire seasons grow in length and intensity. “The government can’t see through the smoke that’s clouding our cities, our towns and our regions,” Mr. Albanese told reporters on Thursday. “These fires,” he added, “are not business as usual.”  Sharon Ellicott, the chief executive of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Association, which represents volunteer firefighters, said that the association had historically been opposed to compensating volunteer firefighters, because it could damage the service’s ethos.  But, she added, “we’re really in unprecedented times.”  In addition to the two firefighters who died, five others were injured in a nearby blaze, with three of them taken to the hospital suffering serious burns on Thursday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.']","Facing harsh criticism for his absence, the prime minister said he would return from a Hawaii trip following the deaths of two volunteer firefighters."
"U.K. Parliament Advances Brexit Bill in Lopsided Vote, All but Assuring January Exit",2019-12-20,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — After more than three years of anguished national debate, multiple cliff-hanging votes, and two general elections, Britain’s Parliament voted by a wide margin on Friday to advance Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan, paving the way for the country to leave the European Union next month. For all the drama of the moment, the vote, 358 to 234, was a foregone conclusion. After the landslide victory of Mr. Johnson and his Conservative Party last week, the outcome was never in doubt — proof, as politicians like to say, that elections have consequences. With Parliament now firmly under the grip of the Conservatives, the days of fierce debate over Britain’s future, which had thwarted Mr. Johnson and his predecessor, Theresa May, are gone. The House of Commons, so recently a grand arena for democratic defiance, has become an efficient vehicle to enact Brexit. The House of Lords must still give its imprimatur, but it is unlikely to obstruct a bill that was enshrined in the manifesto of the Conservative Party and formed the centerpiece of Mr. Johnson’s winning campaign. “We come together as a new Parliament to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done,” Mr. Johnson said in Parliament, joking that he had the votes to wrap up the entire debate by lunchtime or, as he put it, a “late lunch.” The prime minister appealed for unity in the wake of the election, arguing that the completion of Brexit provided an opportunity for Britain to put behind it the tribal feuds of the last three and a half years. “This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain,” Mr. Johnson said. Still, there were a few of the fiery exchanges that became familiar during more than two years of debate over Brexit. The Labour Party’s vanquished leader, Jeremy Corbyn, opposed the plan, fuming that it was a blueprint for deregulation and a predatory trade deal with the United States. “We warned before the general election that the prime minister’s Brexit deal was a terrible deal for our country and we still believe it is a terrible deal today,” he said. Instead of another knife-edge vote, however, the lopsided approval this time was widely foreseen. With an 80-seat majority behind him, Mr. Johnson removed provisions from the bill that might have placated his opponents but limited his room for maneuver. He played to the gallery of Conservative lawmakers sitting behind him in the chamber, ruling out, with characteristic flourish, the possibility of extending a transition period for trade talks with the European Union that is scheduled to end in December 2020. Toggling between Greek mythology and American comic strips, Mr. Johnson likened the delays in enacting Brexit to “a torture that came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown’s football or Prometheus chained to the Tartarean crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle.”  He further reminded lawmakers that it then grew back, “only to be pecked out again in the cycle repeated forever.” While there is no longer any debate over whether Britain will leave the European Union, members of the opposition insisted there should still be a debate over how it leaves. The details of a trade agreement with Brussels are still to be hashed out, and lawmakers said they would oppose a deal that diverged radically from the European Union’s single market and regulations. They noted that although the Conservative Party piled up a big majority in Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system, parties that either opposed Brexit or had misgivings about it actually won a majority of the vote. “Boris Johnson got 43 percent of the vote,” said David Lammy, a Labour Party lawmaker from London, on Twitter. “It is a mandate to govern, but not to impose a hard Brexit that destroys jobs, takes away our rights, and leaves the UK isolated in the world.” Despite the anticlimactic nature of the vote, it was nevertheless a landmark, drawing to an end a tumultuous period that brought Mr. Johnson to power but eviscerated the careers of many of his colleagues in Parliament. Mrs. May lost her post over Brexit. Mr. Corbyn, who is shouldering much of the blame for Labour’s worst performance in a general election since 1935, will soon join her on the backbenches. At least Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn still hold their seats in Parliament. The leader of the centrist and pro-European Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, was ejected by voters in her constituency after a brief and disastrous spell as leader, when she campaigned on the idea of reversing Brexit. So, too, was Nigel Dodds, who had been Westminster leader of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, and whose political fortunes symbolized the twists and turns of the Brexit roller coaster. For two years, after the general election in 2017, Mr. Dodds held the balance of power at Westminster. He propped up Mrs. May’s Conservative minority government and helped kill her Brexit plan by withdrawing support for it from his bloc of 10 Democratic Unionist lawmakers. When Mr. Johnson became prime minister last summer and renegotiated the Brexit agreement, the deal became worse from the perspective of the Democratic Unionists because it now requires checks on goods moving between Britain and Northern Ireland. In the election, voters dumped Mr. Dodds from his seat in North Belfast, one of two seats lost by the party. Many other famous faces are missing from the new Parliament. Philip Hammond, who served as chancellor of the Exchequer under Mrs. May, was expelled from the Conservative Party by Mr. Johnson for resisting his Brexit policy. He did not run again for his seat. Nor did others who were ejected from the party, including Nicholas Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, though he was later reinstated, and Rory Stewart, who is now a candidate for London mayor. “The political landscape has completely changed,” said Vernon Bogdanor, a professor of government at King’s College London. There could be another decade of Conservative rule, he said, because the Labour Party will need two general elections to recover its standing with voters. Mr. Bogdanor said that the government still faced an uphill struggle to negotiate a trade agreement with the European Union. And the government will have to deal with increasingly restive outposts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where strong majorities oppose Brexit and may view it as a pretext to break away.

Italian Police Arrest Over 300 in Raids on Organized Crime,2019-12-19,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The Italian police on Thursday arrested more than 330 people, including politicians, lawyers, accountants and a local police chief, in one of the most extensive law enforcement operations ever against the crime syndicate known as ’Ndrangheta. About 3,000 officers made pre-dawn arrests in 12 Italian regions, as well as in Switzerland, Germany and Bulgaria, officials said. ’Ndrangheta has spread far beyond its historic base in the southern region of Calabria, surpassing the Cosa Nostra, based in Sicily, to become Italy’s most powerful mafia group. The group controls much of Europe’s cocaine trade, European officials say. Nicola Gratteri, the anti-mafia prosecutor who coordinated the operation, described Thursday’s crackdown as “the biggest operation after the Palermo maxi trial,” a reference to a sweep in 1984 that led to a landmark trial against some 450 Sicilian mafia members. That case severely weakened the Cosa Nostra, but its decline permitted the Calabrian syndicate to grow more powerful. Thursday’s operation “completely dismembered the top ranks of the Mancuso family,” the long-established ’Ndrangheta clan operating in the city of Vibo Valentia, with links to the United States, Mr. Gratteri said. The family had infiltrated local politics and public administration, as well as the local economy, he said. The police blitz had been scheduled for Friday but was hastily brought forward a day when investigators discovered that someone had tipped off the mobsters and their associates to the impending arrests. “Can you imagine what it means to move 3,000 men in the space of 24 hours?” Mr. Gratteri asked reporters in Catanzaro, Calabria, where he is chief prosecutor. “It’s something crazy. But we had to move crazily.” The police arrested Luigi Mancuso, whom officials described as the head of the clan, along with dozens of others believed to have ties to the ’Ndrangheta. They also arrested a lawyer and former member of the Italian Parliament from former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party; the president of the Calabrian mayor’s association, a former member of the Democratic Party’s national assembly, and an array of civil servants and other white-collar professionals accused of working with the mob.  They face a variety of charges, including murder, extortion, usury, money laundering, drug trafficking, corruption and belonging to a criminal syndicate. The police also seized property and cash valued at 15 million euros, or about $16.7 million. The Mancuso clan had dominated the area of Vibo Valentia since the 1970s, and had been “marked by prosecutors” in the past, said Enzo Ciconte, an expert in organized crime. But Thursday’s operation “could be the final blow,” he said in an interview. Claudio Cordova, the editor of the online Calabria newspaper Il Dispaccio and the author of a recent book about links between the ’Ndrangheta and Freemasonry, said the operation had struck one of Calabria’s most powerful clans, and had exposed their links “with politicians and professionals.” But Mr. Cordova complained that Calabria, “a difficult territory,” rarely got the support that it needed from the national government, making the eradication of criminal groups more difficult. “Calabria needs to become a national case, like Sicily was,” he said. The Mancuso clan is “one of the most involved in international drug trafficking with international ramifications worldwide,” said Antonio Nicaso, an expert on the ’Ndrangheta and its history who has written several books with Mr. Gratteri. Mr. Nicaso added that the Mancusos were able to amass a huge amount of money from their trafficking. Thursday’s operation “uncovered the link between the Mancuso clan with what I like to call the ‘upper-world,’” he said, citing professionals, politicians, bureaucrats and freemasons as examples.  “What I try to explain all the time is that violence is the backbone but power is the lifeblood of any major criminal organization such as the ’Ndrangheta,” he said. “And if you can’t combine the underworld and the upper world, there will be no power and there will be no future for a criminal organization.” Mr. Gratteri said the investigation began shortly after he was appointed chief prosecutor of Catanzaro, in May 2016. The operation was named “Scott-Rinascita.” “Rinascita” means rebirth, referring to “the rebirth of the territory,” Mr. Gratteri said in a telephone interview. “Scott,” he said, was added in memory of Scott W. Sieben, an agent with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration who “worked with us on many missions,” when he was based in Rome, from 2008 to 2013, and who died in 2015, after returning to the United States. Mr. Gratteri said he believed the operation on Thursday had dealt a profound blow to the Mancuso family, but he cautioned that “you don’t resolve the problem of the mafia with overnight blitzes.” To wipe it out, he said, requires changes in the culture that has accepted it, and better laws against organized crime. “Now it’s up to civil society to occupy the spaces that we created today,” he added. “Otherwise we’re back to square one, and criminals will reoccupy those spaces.” ']","Officials said they had dismantled a major crime family within the ’Ndrangheta, the group based in the southern region of Calabria that is Italy’s most powerful mafia syndicate."
Spain Bars Catalan Leader From Public Office for 18 Months,2019-12-19,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — A Spanish court on Thursday barred the leader of the restive northeastern region of Catalonia from public office for 18 months, for civil disobedience in his show of support for jailed separatists, in a ruling that is likely to fuel the anger of Catalan people who want to break away from Spain. The ruling by a court in Barcelona dealt with yellow ribbons that are displayed throughout Catalonia in solidarity with separatists whose supporters consider them political prisoners of Spain’s central government. Last spring, Quim Torra, the separatist regional president of Catalonia, refused to take down ribbons and other signs on public buildings, in defiance of an order by the electoral commission in Madrid that all partisan symbols be removed from such buildings during the political campaign leading up to a parliamentary election in April. The ruling, which Mr. Torra said he would appeal, was the latest in a long series of clashes pitting Spain’s central government and its judiciary against Catalan leaders who favor independence. Politicians have failed for years to resolve the secessionist conflict, and it has increasingly been left to judges to handle, while continuing to split Catalan society down the middle and fueling street violence. Also on Thursday, the European Union’s highest court made a significant decision in favor of the former deputy leader of Catalonia, Oriol Junqueras, who is serving a prison sentence for sedition. The European Court of Justice ruled that the Spanish authorities should have released Mr. Junqueras so that he could take the seat he won this year in the European Parliament. In October, Spain’s Supreme Court sentenced Mr. Junqueras and eight other former Catalan leaders to prison for their involvement in a botched attempt to secede from Spain in 2017, after holding an independence referendum that had been declared unconstitutional by Spanish courts. Mr. Junqueras received the toughest sentence, 13 years in prison, after he was found guilty of sedition and misuse of public funds. But the European Court ruled that as a member of the European Parliament, Mr. Junqueras had a degree of legal immunity — a decision that has wider repercussions for the longstanding Catalan secessionist movement.  Two other Catalan politicians, Carles Puigdemont, the former separatist leader of Catalonia, and Toni Comín, a former regional minister, who also won seats in the European Parliament in May, also hope to use their recent elections to avoid extradition and prosecution in Spain. On Twitter, Mr. Puigdemont said the ruling was a victory of voters “against authoritarian forces.”  Mr. Junqueras’s case has been regarded as a test of whether European Union parliamentary immunity can override national criminal court proceedings and could affect similar cases.  The European Court ruled that a politician is elected to the European Parliament as soon as the results of the vote are made official, and can immediately benefit from immunity and other privileges granted to European Union lawmakers.  The court determined that Spain was wrong to prevent Mr. Junqueras from taking his seat in the European Parliament while he was in jail awaiting sentencing. It did not say that the sentencing itself was improper. It is unclear what effect the ruling will have on Mr. Junqueras’s case, however, as the court left it up to Spain’s Supreme Court to decide on the practical impact of immunity. It is unlikely that Spain would now release him. The sentencing of Mr. Junqueras and others in October reignited tensions within Catalonia and led to several nights of violence on the streets of Barcelona and other cities as protesters lit fires and threw rocks at the police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.  While the violence had eased in recent weeks, a much-anticipated soccer match between Barcelona and Real Madrid on Wednesday was followed by violent clashes between the police and protesters outside the Barcelona stadium. The October Supreme Court ruling in Spain allowed the country’s judiciary to reactivate international arrest warrants against Mr. Puigdemont and some members of his cabinet. They fled to Brussels in October 2017 after Spain’s government forced their ouster from office. This month, a Belgian court postponed an extradition case against Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Comín, deciding to wait for the European Court ruling on the extent of parliamentary immunity. The election of Catalan separatist politicians to the European Parliament has turned into a political hot potato for the European Union, which has been under pressure to clarify how tightly its members are bound by European law. The Parliament said it would enforce whatever decision was taken by the European Union’s highest court. On Thursday, Mr. Torra joined other separatist politicians in calling for the immediate release of Mr. Junqueras, while maintaining his defiant stance in his own court case.  “My faith in Spanish justice is zero,” Mr. Torra said. “We have to find justice outside when we see how it is denied to us here.” He added: “While we see in Europe an example of justice, Spain continues down the path of repression.” Mr. Junqueras was elected to the European Parliament in May, while in jail in Spain awaiting sentencing. His lawyers have argued that Spain’s judiciary breached his fundamental rights by refusing to let him swear an oath to the Spanish Constitution in order to take up his seat in the European Parliament. The Spanish Supreme Court eventually referred the issue to the European Court of Justice, which is based in Luxembourg. Mr. Junqueras was jailed over two years ago, but has continued to lead his party, Esquerra Republicana, which is now the largest separatist party in the Spanish Parliament. In recent weeks the party has been at the heart of the latest round of negotiations to form a new government in Madrid.  Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s caretaker Socialist prime minister, won a repeat national election in November, but did not come close to a parliamentary majority. Two days after the election, Mr. Sánchez agreed to form a coalition government with a smaller left-wing party, Unidas Podemos, but he has failed so far to persuade other factions to support him.  Catalan separatist parties hold 23 of the 350 seats in Spain’s Parliament, which puts them in a position to give Mr. Sánchez the necessary support to form a government.  Mr. Sánchez’s government did not immediately react to the court ruling on Mr. Junqueras, but some politicians have criticized the European Court for intervening in Spanish affairs.  Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, a politician with the ultranationalist Vox party, told a news conference that the ruling was “a blow for Spain” and an attack on its sovereignty. In July, thousands of Catalan independence supporters gathered at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, to denounce the fact that the newly elected assembly was meeting without some of its Catalan representatives.  Mr. Junqueras has also received support from fellow European lawmakers who have protested the moves to prevent a democratically elected politician from taking his seat.  The European Court ruling comes after the court’s main legal adviser issued a legal opinion last month advising that parliamentary immunity be recognized at the time of election, independent of what procedures different European Union countries use for politicians to be sworn into office.']","A Barcelona court ruled that Quim Torra, the president of the Catalonia region, cannot hold office, after he refused to remove yellow ribbons that signal support of jailed separatist leaders."
"In India Tech City Shocked by Gang Rape, Vigilante Justice Gets Praise",2019-12-21,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['HYDERABAD, India —\xa0All day, every day, at a certain point along a highway leading out of Hyderabad, people stop their cars and get out to peer over the guardrail. It was here, under a highway bridge, that four men torched the body of a young veterinarian after they gang-raped and suffocated her a few weeks ago in a case that horrified the country.  Nearby is another likely crime scene of note: In the green fields that gently roll away from the highway stands a ring of yellow police tape where the police gunned down the four accused men. The police say there was a shootout, and that they killed the men in self-defense. But that is now under investigation, and most people around here seem to believe it was a straight-up case of extrajudicial killing.  None of this happened in an isolated part of India or in some tough, broken place. It happened on the busy outskirts of one of India’s most up-and-coming cities: Hyderabad.  Apple. Google. Facebook. Uber. All have big offices in Hyderabad. So does Amazon, which this year opened its largest office building in the world right here, a futuristic campus with 15,000 employees.  The city, already a huge metropolis of around 10 million, is growing by leaps and bounds. It is famous for its spicy food, fancy shops, rich residents and good relations between Muslims and Hindus. Many Muslims in Hyderabad have joined the protests sweeping the country over a separate issue — a divisive new citizenship law that many Indians feel discriminates against Muslims in this Hindu-majority nation. But the scourge of gang rape is never far from people’s minds.  Most Hyderabadis seem to believe that the police officers shot the rape suspects in cold blood and then placed guns in their hands. Still, many said it was the right thing to do. One crowd even showered police officers in rose petals. “It was the need of the hour,” said Akkineni Nagarjuna, a Hyderabad movie star. “Somebody had to put the fear of God in them.”  The shootings have uncapped a wave of vigilante violence against other rape suspects. One was nearly lynched a few days later on his way to court in Indore.  Many Indians are so fed up with the courts — and it’s not just that trials can drag on for years, but so often infamous criminals evade justice — that they crave swift and decisive punishment, however it comes.  “This is what I like about Hyderabad,” said Akash Chaturvedi, the sales manager at an exotic car dealership in the city. “People here are direct. They take action. They hit their targets.’’  “I meet 20 to 25 people a day: politicians, bureaucrats, big businessmen, celebrities,” he added, as he paused in front of a blue Lamborghini. “Not a single one is unhappy with the action that has taken place.”  Cities anywhere contain jarring contradictions: misery and success, crime and erudition, grit and glitz, all stacked on top of each other. This is especially true in Hyderabad, a fast-changing place in southern India that is striving to be included on the list of the country’s supercities, along with Delhi and Mumbai.  Centuries ago, Hyderabad was the seat of a vast Muslim kingdom that made a fortune from nearby diamond mines, producing some of history’s biggest gems, including the colossal 105.6 carat Koh-i-Noor, which British colonizers snatched.  Today, strong infrastructure and business friendly policies adopted by Hyderabadi officials have attracted so many cyber-based companies that an outlying part of the area is now called Cyberabad. This is where the bloodshed unfolded. Adding to the suspicions of police foul play is that V.C. Sajjanar, Cyberabad’s police commissioner, was the supervising officer in at least two other cases of suspects killed by the police. In each incident, the officers said they acted in self-defense. In this case, the police were under heavy pressure. After the news broke that the veterinarian had been raped and killed, protests erupted across India. Demonstrators demanded that the suspects be hanged.  The outcry was not as seismic as what followed after a young woman was gang raped and fatally brutalized on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012, but the incidents presented disturbing parallels. In both, the young women were on professional tracks, and the weak link was having to rely on nighttime transport that left them vulnerable. In the Delhi attack, a woman who was about to become a physiotherapist came out of a movie theater around 9:30 p.m. She needed a ride and accepted one from an off-duty bus with few passengers.  In Hyderabad, the 26-year-old veterinarian, whose name Indian officials have asked not to be disclosed, parked her motor scooter at a toll plaza outside of a central district around 6 p.m. on Nov. 27. She grabbed a shared taxi to a mall about 10 miles away, a common practice to spare drivers a grueling scooter ride.  But she was being watched.  The police said that four men who worked on a freight truck — Mohammed Arif, Shiva Kumar, Jollu Naveen Kumar and Chintakunta Chenna Keshavulu — deflated her scooter’s back tire right after she left. Then they fortified themselves with a couple bottles of cheap Imperial Blue whiskey, and waited. India’s rates of sex crimes don’t appear higher than many other countries, including the United States. But activists say India has a particular gang rape problem.  Last year, for example, virtually the entire male staff at an upscale apartment complex in Chennai conspired to rape an 11-year-old disabled girl.  And some of the most widely publicized criminal cases in India have turned on rape and murder. Sexual violence experts say this is because many rapists feel that if they destroy the evidence, they will have a good chance of getting away with the crime.  “The problem in India is the failure of the criminal justice system,’’ said Sunitha Krishnan, who runs an anti-sexual trafficking organization in Hyderabad. According to the police, the veterinarian came back from the mall at 9:30 p.m. and when the group of men offered to help her with her flat tire, she sensed danger. On her last phone call, to her sister, right before going with them, she said she was scared.  The men pulled her into a vacant lot. They raped her. She bled badly and fainted.  When she came to, Mr. Arif, the ringleader, according to the police, decided to kill her, smothering her with his hands. The four dragged her body into their truck and drove off to the stretch of fields and highway where they set her on fire.  The police were able to use closed-circuit video footage to identify the truck, which led them to the suspects, and all four confessed, the police said.  They were in custody on Dec. 6 when the officers took them out of jail and back to the crime scene, at 3 a.m. The police said that they needed the men to re-enact the crime, and that two of the suspects grabbed officers’ guns, provoking a shootout. Several legal activists in Delhi have filed lawsuits against the police, saying the shooting amounted to a summary execution. And the families of two of the suspects said that they were minors. But you would struggle to find any others in Hyderabad willing to take the dead men’s side.  “Justice is good,’ said Minhaj Obaid, who works in a call center for Dell computers, as he stood on the highway bridge.  “And instant justice,’’ he said, smiling, “is even better.”  Hari Kumari contributed from New Delhi and S.M. Bilal from Hyderabad']","Hyderabad is a fast-modernizing metropolis, and violence against men accused of rape is finding support. "
Iraq in Worst Political Crisis in Years as Death Toll Mounts From Protests,2019-12-21,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — For 12 weeks, Iraqi protesters have massed in the streets of Baghdad and cities in southern Iraq to demand the ouster of the government, an end to corruption and a halt to the overweening influence of Iran. And for 12 weeks, the government has foundered in its response, alternating vague promises of reform with brutal treatment of protesters by its security forces. More than 500 protesters have been killed and 19,000 wounded, according to the United Nations special envoy to Iraq, but the violent response has only deepened protesters’ resolve.  The prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, has resigned but has remained in a caretaker role, and Parliament has yet to come up with someone to replace him. The political crisis that now confronts Iraq is as serious as any since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein 16 years ago, and its leaders appear ill-equipped to reckon with it. No consensus has emerged for a plan to reform the government to meet the protesters’ demands.  Parliament has not seriously considered even the proposed changes to the election law put forward by President Barham Salih, which would reduce the influence of parties and the corruption they foster. This week, a constitutional deadline for Parliament to nominate a new prime minister came and went. Even finding an acceptable candidate for prime minister is a tall order. “It’s very difficult to find someone who is both broadly acceptable to the street, to the protesters, but who also has the party support, the political support to navigate the transition,” said Maria Fantappie, a senior adviser on Iraq and Syria for the International Crisis Group.  Even if they did, that would hardly begin to address the protesters’ sweeping demands. “Our goal is not to have Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resign,” said Mehdi Chassin, a college student from Amara, in southern Iraq, who came to Baghdad to join the protests. “That makes no difference because another guy will come who will be just the same. We want them all to go.” But Parliament is unlikely to adopt reforms that would end the careers of everyone in it, and the protesters are unlikely to accept anything less.  “What the parties want is rejected by the Iraqi people and what the Iraqi people want is rejected by the parties,” said Karim al-Nuri, a senior official in the Badr Organization, one of the parties that is close to Iran, but has a diverse membership. “So there are two alternatives: either to change the Iraqi people or to change some of the political class and make some change in the political process.” Parliament also seems unprepared to find a way to reduce Iranian influence. Iranian political and military operatives — including senior figures like Qassim Soleimani, the head of the powerful Quds Force that reports to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — have been in and out of Baghdad trying to ensure that whoever is nominated for prime minister meets Iran’s needs. So, rather than debate the protesters’ demands directly, members of Parliament talk about how much they are doing — passing legislation to limit salaries of the ministers for instance. Qais al-Khazali, the leader of one of the Shiite parliamentary blocs close to Iran, said, “We have enacted legislation, that is our responsibility, now the government’s responsibility is to enforce it.” When the protests started on Oct. 1, many who came to demonstrate in Baghdad and across southern Iraq were demanding jobs and services such as electricity and clean water. But after the government opened fire on them, killing more than 100 in the first five days, the number of protesters multiplied and they began to agitate for more far-reaching changes. Overhauling the entire system of government seems far from politically possible. But the protesters’ focus reflects their frustration with the government’s failure to foster economic opportunity or deal with entrenched corruption. These grievances unite all of those who have come to the street: the young people, the workers, the poor, the educated and the barely literate, the tribal leaders as well as urban street sweepers. Some members of Parliament acknowledge that they are engaged in a different struggle: the allocation of spoils in the next government. The discussions over choosing a new prime minister, they said, have centered less on the ideals and desires of the Iraqi people than on political power and money. “There’s a lot of division about who comes next as prime minister, and that’s a problem because the political parties are redividing up the ministries, looking to figure out who gets which ministry share,” said Haithem al-Jubori the head of Parliament’s finance committee. Iran is particularly concerned that it maintain influence in Iraq’s ministries, especially those dealing with security and economic matters. With America’s tight sanctions against Iran, Tehran increasingly needs Iraq in order to “breathe” economically — both for its markets and for military purposes, to protect its interests in Syria and Lebanon.  The parties that are most powerful and closest to Iran are those that grew out of the armed Shiite groups. It is militia units from ministries controlled by those parties, or agencies of the prime minister, that are blamed by human rights activists for the most violent attacks on the protesters. In responding to the protests with violence, these forces are taking a page from the Iranian playbook: When Tehran was faced with protests over gas prices in November, it crushed them brutally, killing as many as 450 people in four days and imprisoning 7,000. While the pace of killings in Iraq has ebbed and flowed, the attacks have become more brutal and there has been an increase in kidnappings, arrests and disappearances of protest leaders, doctors who treat wounded protesters, and journalists. Human Rights Watch and the United Nations Human Rights Commission have called on the government to halt its lawless crackdown. Human Rights Watch has demanded that the United States and Europe to do more to censure the government. For those demonstrating, the more comrades they lose, the harder it is to give up, said Haithem al-Mayahi, a protest leader from Karbala, who said he tried for years to work within the political system.  “The protesters lost hundreds of their friends, their brothers, their family members,” he said. “It’s either you fight to win or you die.” What remains uncertain is whether such continued fighting will lead to political change. One longtime Iraq watcher, the former American ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, said of the protesters, “Unless some leader or cadre of leaders emerges, not much is going to happen and the overthrow of the government is highly unlikely.” “The prime minister has resigned and no one else probably will be named quickly,” Mr. Crocker said. “And that, in a perverse way, keeps the government safe because there is nothing to overthrow, so things just keep going along.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting.

"Nigeria Cracks Down on a Critic, and a New Jersey Town Pushes Back",2019-12-22,By Ruth Maclean,"['HAWORTH, N.J. — Opeyemi Sowore watched the videos on her phone in bed in her New Jersey home, the children still asleep, the Christmas tree twinkling downstairs.  The videos showed her husband — a former presidential candidate and the publisher of a website known as Africa’s WikiLeaks — being wrestled to the floor in a Nigerian courtroom by a man in a black suit, as lawyers in wigs and gowns crowded around shouting. The court had ruled that her husband, Omoyele Sowore, should be free on bail while awaiting trial on charges of treason, money laundering and, for criticizing President Muhammadu Buhari on television, cyberstalking. But on Dec. 6, while his wife slept more than 5,000 miles away, Mr. Sowore was taken from the courtroom back into detention, where he has been held for nearly all of the past five months.  Before Mr. Sowore was led away by Nigeria’s equivalent of the Secret Service, he was videotaped saying that these “might be my only words on record before they kill me.” His wife has had no contact with him since. When Mr. Buhari was elected in 2015 as president of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and largest economy, it was hailed as a triumph for democracy. Since then, however, his government has turned toward harsh authoritarianism, putting the country’s thriving civic organizations and news media to the test. Protests have been met with deadly force. The country’s chief justice was summarily sacked. Humanitarian organizations that criticize the state were threatened with closure, and newspaper offices were raided. One journalist, Jones Abiri, has been in detention so long that for a time, he was thought to be dead.  One bill now making its way through Nigeria’s Senate proposes the death penalty for some instances of “hate speech.” A second, the Anti-Social Media Bill, modeled on a new Singaporean law, calls for government critics to spend as much as three years in prison. Nigeria is not alone in clamping down on freedom of expression. \u200bA punitive new security law \u200bin traditionally media-friendly Burkina Faso, a proposed hate speech measure in Ethiopia, a harsh crackdown in Tanzania and routine internet and social media shutdowns across Africa point to a wider trend toward censorship. “The people in power just don’t want to have to tolerate the voices of the people,” said Ayisha Osori, head of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa. African leaders feel emboldened to strangle the news media because of a perceived global rollback in democracy, she said. Mr. Sowore founded a website in 2006, Sahara Reporters, that specializes in exposing corruption and government malfeasance. With funding from American foundations and about 50 staff members working in Nigeria and the United States, the site’s publication of leaked, often unfiltered information disrupted Nigeria’s traditional media scene. By basing his operation in New York, Mr. Sowore for years had a degree of protection from the consequences of publishing often scandalous information about Nigeria’s most powerful people. He shuttled between his family home in New Jersey and Nigeria, where he is a citizen, without much interference. Then, on Aug. 3, in the middle of the night, he was arrested by Nigeria’s Department of State Services, or D.S.S., in his Lagos hotel room. At first, Opeyemi Sowore told no one in Haworth, a well-off suburb about 20 miles from midtown Manhattan, about her husband’s arrest. None of them knew much about Nigeria, or what Mr. Sowore, known as Yele, did for a living. As far as they were concerned, he was just a dad and a keen runner. One day, though, texting with another mother with children at the local school, Ms. Sowore explained why her husband had been away so long. Word traveled fast in Haworth, a town of 3,500 people. “One mom told another mom, told another mom, told another mom, and next thing we knew we had assembled what really is functioning as a crisis management team,” said Alanna Zahn Davis, one of the mothers in that chain. If Mr. Buhari’s government had gotten tough, so would Haworth. A core group of 10 women raised the alarm at the State Department. Then they reached Amal Clooney, the human rights lawyer, who demanded Mr. Sowore’s release. They worked with Amnesty International, which declared him a prisoner of conscience.  Sometimes they prepared meals for Ms. Sowore, a marketing executive, or looked after the couple’s two children. Inspired by an American tradition of using yellow ribbons to remember hostages, they held “Yele ribbon” ceremonies in Haworth’s tree-lined town center, attended by hundreds of people. After the courtroom melee, they called members of Congress, engaging New Jersey Senators Robert Menendez and Cory Booker. Six members of Congress sent a letter on Friday to Nigeria’s attorney general condemning the treatment of Mr. Sowore.  His detention “will only serve to tarnish Nigeria’s international reputation and its standing as a leading African democracy,” they wrote.  Before his arrest, Mr. Sowore was often accused of favoring Mr. Buhari, even helping him get elected. Sahara Reporters’ relentless exposés of graft under the previous government meant Mr. Buhari’s vow to sweep the country clean of corruption resonated with voters. One of Mr. Buhari’s earliest interviews as president was with Sahara TV. However, Mr. Buhari’s administration turned out to have a corrupt bent, too, along with authoritarian tendencies, said Chidi Odinkalu, the former chairman of Nigeria’s Human Rights Commission. “The Buhari administration has proved to be at least as bad, if not much worse” than the prior administration that Mr. Buhari had promised not to emulate, said Mr. Odinkalu, who is facing prosecution himself after he criticized one of the president’s close allies. This was not a great surprise to those who remember how Mr. Buhari, now 77, first came to power in 1983 as a major general in the wake of a military coup. Before being overthrown in another coup, he jailed hundreds of people, made tardy civil servants do frog jumps and had three men executed. By the time he was democratically elected three decades later, in 2015, it was on promises to tackle corruption and insecurity. Nigeria was battling Boko Haram, oil theft and violent clashes across the country. He often appeared frail, said little in public and spent many months of his first term being treated for a mysterious illness in London. Sahara Reporters wrote about the absences and allegations of his allies’ corruption, and Mr. Sowore openly condemned the government for failing to meet its promises. He ran unsuccessfully for president against Mr. Buhari in February, and was preparing to lead a protest calling for revolution when he was arrested on August 3. At the time, La Keisha Landrum Pierre, Sahara Reporters’ chief operating officer back in New York, was heavily pregnant. When she gave birth five days later, she was managing the company’s biggest crisis ever. It keeps getting bigger. She said that the Nigerian government had frozen the site’s financial account.  “There have been armed D.S.S. men standing outside our offices” in Nigeria, said Ms. Landrum Pierre, in between calls and meetings in Manhattan. She had to cut the staff by 70 percent, and said that most of the remaining employees, feeling intimidated, were staying at home. On Dec. 6, the court scheduled Mr. Sowore’s trial for February, but he did not remain free on bail as previously ordered. Instead, Mr. Sowore’s lawyers and family maintain, D.S.S. agents attacked Mr. Sowore while still in the courtroom and ultimately took him back into custody. The D.S.S. said in a statement that it had rearrested Mr. Sowore because of public comments it claims he made the prior night promising to pursue his cause. A D.S.S. spokesman also claimed that Mr. Sowore’s supporters had staged the courtroom attack and were trying to frame its agents. Ms. Sowore said that watching the videos made her afraid for his life. “The hardest part about it for me was — how do I tell my kids?” she said. They have tried to help.

Japan Wants to Dump Nuclear Plant’s Tainted Water. Fishermen Fear the Worst.,2019-12-23,By Motoko Rich and Makiko Inoue,"['IWAKI, Japan — The overpowering earthquake and tsunami that ripped through northern Japan in March 2011 took so much from Tatsuo Niitsuma, a commercial fisherman in this coastal city in Fukushima Prefecture. The tsunami pulverized his fishing boat. It demolished his home. Most devastating of all, it took the life of his daughter. Now, nearly nine years after the disaster, Mr. Niitsuma, 77, is at risk of losing his entire livelihood, too, as the government considers releasing tainted water from a nuclear power plant destroyed by the tsunami’s waves. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet and the Tokyo Electric Power Company — the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, where a triple meltdown led to the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl — must decide what to do with more than one million tons of contaminated water stored in about 1,000 giant tanks on the plant site. On Monday, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry proposed gradually releasing the water into the ocean or allowing it to evaporate, saying a controlled discharge into the sea would “stably dilute and disperse” it. The ministry ruled out alternatives like continuing to store it in tanks or injecting it deep into the ground. Mr. Abe’s cabinet will make the final decision. The water becomes contaminated as it is pumped through the reactors to cool melted fuel that is still too hot and radioactive to remove. For years, the power company, known as Tepco, said that treatment of the water — which involves sending it through a powerful filtration system to remove most radioactive material — was making it safe to release.  But it is actually more radioactive than the authorities have previously publicized. Officials say that it will be treated again, and that it will then be safe for release. Regardless of government assurances, if the water is discharged into the sea, it will most likely destroy the livelihoods of hundreds of fishermen like Mr. Niitsuma. Consumers are already worried about the safety of Fukushima seafood, and dumping the water would compound the fears. It would “kill the industry and take away the life of the boats,” he said. “The fish won’t sell.” With Fukushima preparing to host baseball games during the Summer Olympics next year, and the plant running out of land on which to build storage tanks, the debate has taken on a sense of urgency. Until last year, Tepco indicated that with the vast majority of the water, all but one type of radioactive material — tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that experts say poses a relatively low risk to human health — had been removed to levels deemed safe for discharge under Japanese government standards. But last summer, the power company acknowledged that only about a fifth of the stored water had been effectively treated. Last month, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry briefed reporters and diplomats about the water stored in Fukushima. More than three-quarters of it, the ministry said, still contains radioactive material other than tritium — and at higher levels than the government considers safe for human health. The authorities say that in the early years of processing the deluge of water flowing through the reactors, Tepco did not change filters in the decontamination system frequently enough. The company said it would re-treat the water to filter out the bulk of the nuclear particles, making it safe to release into the ocean. Some experts and local residents say it is difficult to trust such assurances. “The government and Tepco were hiding the fact that the water was still contaminated,” said Kazuyoshi Satoh, a member of the city assembly in Iwaki. “Because next year is the Tokyo Olympics, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to present the image that everything is ‘under control,’” said Mr. Satoh, referring to a speech by the Japanese leader to the International Olympic Committee when Tokyo was bidding to host the 2020 Games.  The power company acknowledged that it had not made it easy for the public to get information. The water treatment data “has not been presented in a manner that is easy to understand,” said Ryounosuke Takanori, a Tepco spokesman. “As long as the water was stored in the tanks, we thought it didn’t matter whether the water” exceeded safety standards for discharge, said Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager in the Fukushima Daiichi decontamination and decommissioning office.  Mr. Niitsuma, for whom fishing is not just a livelihood but also a balm against grief over the loss of his daughter, said he thought both Tepco and the government needed to come clean. “I want them to see the reality squarely and disclose information fully,” said Mr. Niitsuma, who goes out alone on his two-ton boat at dawn three times a week. His wife, Yoko, waits on the pier. On a recent morning, she helped drag the nets out of the boat and dump squirming octopus, flounder and a few red gurnard into buckets that the couple loaded onto a small flatbed truck to drive to a warehouse where wholesalers bid on the fish. Mrs. Niitsuma said she didn’t believe the government was looking out for Fukushima’s fishing families. “They are talking about discharging the water,” she said. “That itself means they are not thinking about us.” The question of whether the water could be decontaminated to safe levels is a matter of degree, scientists say. If the water is processed so that the only radioactive materials that remain are low levels of tritium, said Kazuya Idemitsu, a professor of nuclear engineering at Kyushu University, releasing it into the ocean would be “the best solution in terms of cost and safety.” Mr. Idemitsu added that functioning nuclear plants around the world release diluted water containing tritium into the ocean. Some scientists said they would need proof before believing that the Fukushima water was treated to safe levels. “I want to see the numbers after they’ve removed these additional radionuclides,” said Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist in marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “Then, and only then, can I make a judgment on the quality of the rationale for releasing it or the consequences of releasing it.” Government officials argue that the water is not so much a scientific problem as a perceptual one. “If the water is discharged into the ocean, the price of seafood products may drop, or consumers won’t want to buy them at all,” said Shuji Okuda, director for decommissioning and contaminated water management at the economy and trade ministry. “So even though there is no scientific evidence that the water is dangerous, we are worried about the effects.” More than 20 countries still have import restrictions on Japanese seafood and other agricultural products that were imposed after the 2011 disaster. Earlier this year, the European Union lifted its ban on some products. In Fukushima, the fishing industry brings only about 15 percent of its pre-disaster catch levels to market. Every haul is sampled and screened in labs run by Fukushima’s prefectural government and the fisheries cooperative.  According to the co-op, the central government currently prohibits the sale of only one species, a rare type of skate. Tadaaki Sawada, the co-op’s division chief, said that if the water was discharged, buyers would be unlikely to believe government safety assurances. “Most people can live without fully understanding the details of radioactivity,” Mr. Sawada said. “They can just say ‘because I don’t understand fully, I won’t buy Fukushima fish.’” In the prefecture, where thousands of residents never returned after evacuating, those who have come back harbor lingering doubts. “In the corner of my mind, I wonder if it is safe or not,” Keiko Nagayama, 65, said as she browsed at a seafood freezer in Naraha, a hamlet in the original 12-mile exclusion zone around the Fukushima plant.  A government evacuation order was lifted in 2015. Although flounder and Pacific saury from Iwaki were on sale, Ms. Nagayama chose flounder from Hokkaido, in far northern Japan. Yukiei Matsumoto, Naraha’s mayor, declined to offer an opinion on the idea of water disposal from the nuclear plant. “Nuclear policy is central government policy,” Mr. Matsumoto said. “The contaminated water is their business.” Naraha is one of several Fukushima towns where the central government has spent heavily to draw people back to their communities. Just 3,877 people — a little over half of the original population — have returned. Tokyo has devoted large sums to subsidize a new school, a strip mall and a new arena that cost 4 billion yen, or about $37 million. On a recent afternoon, a smattering of people worked out in the gym, while just one man used the 25-meter swimming pool in the arena complex.  Yukari Nakamura, 33, a local artist, had been hired to paint murals on the walls and windows. Her husband, Yuuki, and two young children were the only family in a spacious playroom. Ms. Nakamura said a Fukushima label on fish gave her pause. “My heart aches to reject the seafood, and I feel such pain not being able to recommend it,” she said, tearing up. “I don’t want to hurt the fishermen who caught it, but it is so complicated.”']","The water from the Fukushima disaster is more radioactive than the authorities have previously publicized, raising doubts about government assurances that it will be made safe."
"For Women in Kabul, ‘It Is Just Me and the Water’",2019-12-22,By Fatima Faizi and Thomas Gibbons-Neff,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — When Fatema Saeedi is in the pool, she cannot hear the crowded, chaotic noise of the city around her. She does not think about suicide bombings or Taliban attacks. She concentrates on her breathing as she moves through the water. One hand in front of the other. Exhale. For Ms. Saeedi, 26, the swimming pool is a refuge. The clean water, the walls and the women around her — all sealed off from the male patrons nearby — are a welcome respite from Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital. Though the city has become markedly more politically progressive in the nearly two decades it has been governed by a Western-backed democracy, Kabul is still steeped in a socially conservative Afghan culture that often relegates women to hidden or subjugated roles.  “In Kabul, women can’t go anywhere,” Ms. Saeedi said recently as she finished a swim. “But here, I don’t have to cover up and pretend anything. I am just myself.” The sport, though growing in popularity among both men and women, is inherently a niche one for the landlocked country. From 1996 to 2001, when Afghanistan was ruled by the Taliban, the Sunni hard-line group severely restricted many recreational activities and banned women altogether from sports, most jobs and public education. The first pool to open in Kabul under the Taliban was in May 2001, just months before the American-backed invasion, in response to the Sept. 11 attacks, ousted the group from the country. The men-only pool was on the grounds of the Intercontinental Hotel.  Since then, 23 public and private pools have appeared in Kabul, a city of nearly five million people, but only two allow women, said Ihsan Taheri, the former head of Afghanistan’s swimming federation. One of those pools, Amu, is in western Kabul, and is partially owned by the Red Cross. It has a large, Olympic-size pool for men, with an adjoining snack bar. The women’s pool is accessible from a different entrance, which leads to a basement that is notably dirtier and a third the size of the men’s area. To enter, women have to lock up their cellphones, as any picture-taking in the swimming area is strictly prohibited. The Times was given special permission by both the pool and the swimmers to photograph inside.  At the women’s pool, there is no snack bar, just a collection of tables where women can eat food ordered and delivered, in a complicated segregated exchange, from the male side. And pool membership costs more than it does for the men. Still, Ms. Saeedi said, “When I come here, I forget about everything else.”  “It is just me and the water, and it is safe,” she added.  Ms. Saeedi learned how to swim as a child in the Sangi Masha, a river that cuts through the hills near her rural childhood home in the country’s southeastern Ghazni Province. After she moved to Kabul to attend university and study radiology, finding time to swim was last on her list of priorities. But in the last few months, Ms. Saeedi has found her way back to the water, even though it is often a two-hour drive from her house and nearly too expensive. “Underwater is a different world,” she said. Helena Saboori, the director of the female committee at the country’s swimming federation, said there had been increased interest in the sport since the two women’s pools opened.  Amu opened four years ago. The other women-only pool, small and private, opened last year in the middle of the city. The pool is named after a former Afghan Queen, Soraya Tarzi, who pushed for women’s rights in the country in the 1920s. “The society has changed, and that is why women can go swimming a bit more openly,” Ms. Saboori said. The Amu pool costs $75 a month for women, about $20 more than their male counterparts. That means only well-to-do people can afford to join; a typical unskilled laborer in Afghanistan earns barely $4 a day. When asked why the difference in price, one of the pool’s managers, Mohamed Rahim, said the women’s pool and locker room cost more for upkeep because female swimmers sometimes wear makeup that dirties the water.  There are also fewer of them, Mr. Rahim said, meaning that the financial overhead for changing the water has to be covered by the existing membership. But, he added, the pool is working to lower the price. Mr. Rahim doesn’t know the exact number of women who come a day. It often varies — anywhere between 15 and 70 — and the pool has no database to track attendance.  Women swim from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. The men’s pool is also open during those hours, but they are also allowed to swim at night.  The stuttering economy and the declining security in the capital have certainly affected business, Mr. Rahim said, for both women and men. “When we first opened and started allowing women to swim, we also received many threats,” Mr. Rahim said. Arezo Hassanzada, 28, is an aquatic trainer at Amu. Four years ago, when the pool first opened, she came looking for a job as a front-desk receptionist. “Since I was a kid, I wanted to learn how to swim, but there was no place to go and learn,” she said. After watching women come to the pool, she soon hopped into the water alongside them. Now, she sometimes sits poolside, helping other women into an array of yellow and brown life jackets before they enter the water for their first time. Outside the rhythmic splashing and laughing inherent to Amu’s confines is the looming possibility that the Taliban could someday come back into power, whether through a peace deal with the United States or otherwise. And if it does, the group would almost certainly try to bring an end to the growing sport. The fear was palpable last July, when Taliban rockets struck in Amu’s neighborhood, wounding at least seven people. Ms. Hassanzada was overseeing a pool-full of women when she heard the explosions and quickly shepherded them out of the water. “I thought to myself, ‘Maybe our customers won’t come back,’” Ms. Hassanzada said. “But the next morning, they did.”']","Since 2001, 23 public and private pools have appeared in Kabul, but only two allow women. They’re a welcome refuge from suicide bombings and the threat of a Taliban takeover."
They Built a Homeland Far From China’s Grip. Now They’re Afraid.,2019-12-21,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Six years ago, he fled China’s crackdown on Muslim Uighurs and sought refuge in Turkey, joining a community of fellow exiles. He started a business with his brother, translating and publishing self-help books into their language. His wife got a job as a teacher in a Uighur school where his children began to take classes. Now, Ablet Abdugani worries the life he built will disappear.  The Turkish government told him he had to leave the country. That could mean being sent back to China and likely straight into detention in a sprawling network of internment camps where about one million Muslims are held. “I am scared whenever the door opens,” Mr. Abdugani said in his apartment on the far outskirts of Istanbul. “I feel very sad about my six years here.” Uighurs have left China in droves as the government intensified a campaign of assimilation in the western region of Xinjiang. In the last three years, at least 11,000 have landed in Turkey, long a favored haven. Now, they worry they could become pawns in a geopolitical game.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who a decade ago called Beijing’s treatment of the Uighurs a genocide, has tried to reduce his country’s reliance on the West by turning to nations such as China. In recent years, he has secured billions of dollars in loans and investments from the Asian giant to help prop up the faltering Turkish economy.  Earlier this year, Turkey deported at least four Uighurs to Tajikistan. From there, they were sent back to China, alarming the Uighur community and drawing protests on social media. Turkish authorities later said they would not send any Uighurs back to China. But Mr. Abdugani, who was not deported, and many others like him remain anxious. “We are caught in the middle of Chinese-Turkish relations and we don’t even know how much we are worth,” Mr. Abdugani said. For those who have fled China, Turkey has offered them a place to reimagine their homeland. Their people share a common heritage and similar languages. Turkey’s government recognizes Turkic people as their own, making it a rare Muslim-majority nation that has spoken up for the Uighurs despite China’s objections. They can practice Islam without fear and celebrate the culture of their 12 million people. They teach classes on religion and the Uighur language and hold a yearly rally for their rights, activities that would be risky, or even banned, in China. But many Uighurs in Turkey find themselves in a state of impermanence. They are denied work permits and business licenses, and in some cases permanent residence and citizenship. Once their Chinese passports expire, they are left effectively stateless. The Uighurs speak a Turkic language and write in an Arabic script. Their mosques feature turquoise tiled domes, their homes are decorated with Afghan-style rugs and their kitchens serve up cumin-spiced lamb pilaf and naan. Some refer to their homeland — an expanse of deserts, mountains and ancient oasis towns — not by its official Chinese name but as East Turkestan, the name of two short-lived Uighur republics. In their new home in Turkey, the Uighurs found something rare: a chance to restore their way of life and the reservoir of collective memory that China’s ruling Communist Party has sought to erode. China intensified restrictions on the Uighurs after a spate of violent attacks in 2014 that the authorities blamed on extremists. Arrests and criminal convictions soared.  The authorities have confiscated Uighur books, restricted the use of the language in schools and detained scholars, artists and intellectuals, among others, in indoctrination camps.  Omer Hemdulla was studying in the Middle East in 2017 when his family in China warned him against going home. The authorities had arrested his brothers and confiscated their businesses, they told him.  He went to Turkey and took over a bookstore in Istanbul in January, joining a burgeoning trade of printing books in the Uighur language. “The entire Uighur nation is in danger. Our people are being tortured,” said Mr. Hemdulla, 30, a law graduate.  He and his business partner, Nur Ahmet Mahmut, 32, publish anything they can find, from Uighur history and literature to children’s stories and cookery books. They sell symbols of their hoped-for republic, East Turkestan — such as its sky blue flag with white crescent and star — items that are outlawed in China. Mr. Hemdulla stocks books that were banned in Xinjiang. Among the most popular, he said, are the novel “Awakened Land,” by Abdurehim Otkur, a well-known Uighur author, and “East Turkestan History” by Muhamet Emin Bugra, an exiled Turkic Muslim leader. “I only read them when I came to Turkey and I realized China oppressed and occupied us a long time ago,” he said. His shop is among half a dozen bookstores in the outlying districts of Sefakoy and Zeytinburnu in Istanbul, where many of the estimated 50,000 Uighurs in Turkey live.  Another publisher, Abduljalil Turan, 61, started his business in the 1990s, focusing on Islamic books and Uighur history and literature. He asked friends to bring books to Turkey and then began publishing works of Uighur exiles, including his own writings. He steadily expanded his stock to 1,000 titles and exports them to Uighur communities around the world. “It is part of the cause,” he said, “to keep awareness alive about our condition.” For many Uighurs brought up under Communism, Turkey provides them a chance to raise a generation unbound by party orthodoxy, children who are free to embrace religion and their ethnic roots. In China, Niaz Abdulla Bostani was imprisoned for three years for teaching the Quran to Uighur children. Now, at 87, he holds religious classes for Uighur children on weekends at a local hall in Istanbul. “Young people come to me and ask questions,” he explained. “Education is the answer. It will not solve things in a few days, but it will affect you all your life.” Abdurashid Niaz, 55, was imprisoned for a year in China in 2005 for translating a book by the Egyptian Islamist Muhammad Qutb from Mandarin to Uighur. He now runs a Uighur school in Istanbul with his wife, and says the internment drive in Xinjiang has made the Uighurs worried about their people’s survival. “Everyone is discussing whether in 50 years, will our culture disappear,” Mr. Abdurashid said. Four children were studying geography with his wife, Anifa Abdurashid, on a recent morning, and they leapt to answer questions about their homeland. “I know the population is 32 million,” the youngest in the class, Abdulla, piped up. The true population of the region of Xinjiang, of which Uighurs make up half, is closer to 24 million, but Mrs. Abdurashid let it go. The Uighurs have preserved their identity through five millenniums, said Ferhat Kurban Tanridagli, a musician and scholar of Turkic languages. He runs an arts school with his wife, a singer, and teaches music and dance to Uighur children. He plays the dutar, a long-necked, two-string lute that has been played for 4,000 years in Central Asia. “Made in Kashgar, in 1993,” he said proudly, turning the instrument of gleaming peanut wood, inlaid with bone, in his hands, referring to the fabled Silk Road trading town which now lives under tight police surveillance. He warned that the Uighurs would not be able to withstand China’s onslaught on their own. “If they destroy us, they will not stop. They will do it to others,” he said. “All the world needs to say to China to stop. We have no other choice.” This summer, the threat of deportation cast a new shadow of uncertainty over the Uighurs.  Mr. Abdugani, the businessman who had been told in July by the government to leave, said 40 others had received similar orders. The Uighurs were deeply troubled when the authorities, as part of a crackdown on illegal immigrants, deported a Uighur woman and her two children to Tajikistan, which sent them back to China. A fourth Uighur, also a woman, was deported as well. The children were handed to their grandmother, but relatives have no news of the two women and fear they have been detained. An estimated 2,500 Uighurs do not have legal residency. Turkey’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said in August that the government was trying to manage migration with “mercy and conscience,” and would not deport Uighurs. Those without residence papers like Mr. Abdugani could seek humanitarian protection, he said. That would grant them refugee status and access to health care services but not allow them to work.  Mr. Abdugani applied for humanitarian protection, but several months later was still waiting for a response and risks arrest for his illegal status. The family was surviving on his wife’s salary and they could not pay for school books or the bus fare, so his children were walking to class most days.  Even as Turkey allows them to stay, many Uighurs said that immigration rules and the state bureaucracy make survival difficult. Mr. Abdugani said he wanted long-term residence, which would allow him to work and support his family, and after seven years, apply for citizenship. Businessmen complain they are restricted from developing their businesses, political activists say the authorities limit their demonstrations, and students are only offered free college education if they study religion.  And there is always a lingering fear of China’s reach. Abdulla Turkestanli, 49, a book publisher, said he was detained without charge by the Turkish authorities for a year in 2017. He suspected that Beijing had complained about him when he opened a second bookstore in the district of Sefakoy. The Turkish authorities never explained why he was detained.  “A lot of writers are in prison or dead” he said. “They are accused of terrorism in China, and so they say we are helping them.” “I am fine, thanks be to God,” he said, “but still, there is danger.”']","China’s repressed Uighurs have long found sanctuary in Turkey.

"General Who Was Algeria’s De Facto Ruler Dies, Leaving a Power Vacuum",2019-12-23,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Algeria’s de facto ruler, Gen. Ahmed Gaïd Salah, who this year managed the ouster of one president and the ascent of another amid deep civil unrest, died on Monday, according to the state news agency and Algerian press reports. General Gaïd Salah’s unexpected death at 79 — his official age, though he was most likely older — less than two weeks after the army’s favored candidate was elected president, creates a power vacuum in the vast North African nation, a major oil and gas producer. A survivor from the generation that led Algeria to independence from France in the early 1960s, General Gaïd Salah was the man who increasingly blocked the demands of the popular protest movement that has rocked the country’s politics since last February.  As chief of staff, General Gaïd Salah orchestrated a hardening crackdown on the movement, imposed a presidential election that the protesters rejected, and demanded, in regular if stiff televised speeches to other army officers, that the demonstrators back off. The movement has rejected the newly elected president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, as a mere figurehead, put in place to carry out the general’s wishes.  Algerian news media said that General Gaïd Salah died of a heart attack Monday morning in an Algiers military hospital. Earlier this year, he appeared to be bidding for the protest movement’s allegiance, forcing out in April the longtime president he had steadfastly backed, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, by having him declared unfit for office. He was also behind the arrests of numerous businessmen associated with Mr. Bouteflika, as well as several of his prime ministers, and Saïd Bouteflika, the former president’s powerful brother. “Gaïd Salah was essentially known because of Bouteflika,” said Benjamin Stora, a leading historian of Algeria. “He owed his career to Bouteflika. He supported him until the end, and he was the last to say he had to go.” But the protest movement, known as the Hirak, demanded more: the departure of General Gaïd Salah himself, and everyone associated with the military-political elite, which Algerians call the System, that has ruled the country since independence in 1962. This the general refused. It is unclear how much of a free hand Mr. Tebboune, the new president, will have in running the country, with the military leaders in General Gaïd Salah’s circle still in the background. The “red line” the president cannot cross, according to Mr. Stora, is “the army’s role in the economy,” including the generous funding it receives, making it the top arms buyer in Africa. General Gaïd Salah began his military career as a teenager in the national liberation army fighting the French. He later trained at a Soviet military academy and rose through the ranks of the Algerian army, becoming head of ground forces in Algeria’s bloody 1990s civil war with the Islamists. He had formed a strong alliance with Mr. Bouteflika in the early 2000s, ever since the Algerian president saved him from a forced early retirement. As Mr. Bouteflika’s vice-minister of defense, he helped his benefactor dismantle the country’s powerful internal security services. For years, General Gaïd Salah dutifully stood in the shadows, ready to back Mr. Bouteflika but never stealing the limelight. And the government showered cash on him and his army from the country’s oil earnings. “The death of General Gaïd Salah is a harsh blow to the System, which will be somewhat destabilized,” Nacer Djabi, a leading sociologist, said Monday in Algiers. “Obviously, his personality counted for a great deal in the way the situation was unfolding.” “This was a man who had been able to break with the Bouteflika system, relying at first on the Hirak, and who also did a lot in the fight against corruption,” Mr. Djabi said. “For Algerians, he did some things that were scarcely believable, including the arrest of a number of important figures, but we’re just going to have to wait to see what the real impact will be.” “But this death signals the disappearance of a whole political and military generation,” he added. Others were more measured. “Since there is now an elected president, I don’t think the general’s death will have a huge impact on the way the situation unfolds,” said Mohamed Hennad, a political scientist in Algiers. “And I don’t think the executive’s strategy will change that much.” Still, it was the general’s name that the crowds shouted, with anger and derision, for months in Algiers, insisting that he leave the country’s governance to civilians. Whether that will now happen is an open question. Hadjer Guenanfa contributed reporting from Algiers.']","Gen.

Severe Weather Across Europe Leaves at Least 9 Dead,2019-12-22,By Raphael Minder and Iliana Magra,"['VIGO, Spain — A one-two punch of winter storms has socked Europe with strong winds and rain over several days, leaving at least nine people dead.  The first storm swept across Portugal, Spain, and southern France on Thursday and Friday, and severe flooding hit parts of Britain over the weekend.  The storms killed at least seven people in Spain, where high winds also downed power lines, scattered debris on roads and railroad tracks, and forced some flight cancellations.  Smaller towns in the north of the country were hit by flooding. Residents were evacuated on Friday from Reinosa, about 240 miles north of Madrid, while others watched from their balconies as vehicles were swept down the streets by the floodwaters, according to local news reports.  Parks and public gardens across Madrid — including the Retiro, the 350-acre park in the heart of the city — reopened on Sunday. They had been closed since Thursday because of fears that the strong winds could blow down tree branches and endanger visitors.  The authorities in Madrid said on Saturday that a 32-year-old woman from South Korea had died after being struck by debris that had blown off a building in the city. Other victims of the storms in Spain included a Dutch man who died while surfing near Huelva on the southwestern coast, and a farmer in the southern province of Granada whose vehicle was swept away when he tried to cross a flooded road. The northwestern region of Galicia remained on red alert on Sunday — the highest level — because of high winds caused by the second storm. About 27,000 homes were left without electricity in Galicia after power lines were destroyed.  The storms also killed at least two people in Portugal. One man died in Montijo, a town near Lisbon, after a tree fell on his truck, and another was killed after his house collapsed in the northern province of Castro Daire, Reuters reported. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in many parts of the country. Emergency teams had to remove debris from the tracks. The storms disrupted traffic in and around Lisbon, the capital, leading to the suspension of ferry services across the Tagus river as well as the coastal rail line. Train service between Lisbon and Porto, the country’s second-largest city, resumed on Sunday.  No injuries were reported in France, but strong winds that have buffeted the country since Friday set a record. Winds of up to 130 kilometers per hour (81 miles per hour) were recorded in St.-Etienne-Bouthéon in central France, an intensity not seen since 1981, according to Météo France, the national meteorological service.  In Britain, the Environment Agency issued more than 270 flood warnings and alerts for England after many villages were struck by heavy rains and severe flooding over the weekend.  There were even reports of a tornado in the town of Chertsey, in southeastern England, the national weather service said Saturday. Philip Passey, a Chertsey resident, told the BBC that he froze when he saw the tornado. “The leaves were going horizontal,” he said, adding that the winds had lifted a trampoline in the air. “There was a huge roar, then nothing.” Raphael Minder reported from Vigo, Spain, and Iliana Magra from London.']","A series of winter storms unleashed heavy rain and strong winds across Portugal, Spain, France and Britain.

Polish Government Pushes Legislation to Tighten Control Over Judges,2019-12-21,By Joanna Berendt,"['WARSAW — Poland’s right-wing governing party is pressing ahead with sweeping new legislation to tighten controls over judges, despite concerns from European Union officials that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the country’s democracy.  The draft law aims to prevent judges from questioning the independence of peers nominated by a council controlled by the governing party — appointments that, up until about two years ago, used to be made by other judges. It also seeks to punish judges who criticize the government’s campaign to overhaul the judiciary or who engage in “political activities” without specifically spelling out what constitutes such activity.  The governing Law and Justice party swept to power in 2015 with a message of national pride steeped in skepticism of the European Union and anti-immigrant sentiment. It has since made reshaping the courts the center of its political agenda.  The government’s steady efforts to assert ever-greater control over all aspects of the judiciary have drawn harsh rebukes from the European Union and international rights watchdogs, which have accused the government of chipping away at democracy and drifting toward authoritarianism. On Wednesday, Poles protested in some 160 cities across the country to vent their anger over the proposed legislation and to press lawmakers to abandon it. Demonstrators in Warsaw chanted “We will prevail” and raised banners that read: “1956: Stalinism ended. 1989: Communism ended. 2019: Why are you bringing them back?” Poland’s Supreme Court warned that the draft law could pave the way for the country’s exit from the European Union altogether. While such an exit seems highly unlikely, the European Commission took the unusual step on Thursday of calling on the Polish Parliament, president and prime minister to halt all proceedings and consult the Venice Commission — a panel of European constitutional law experts — about the legislation. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned on Friday that the legislation “risks further undermining the already heavily challenged independence of the judiciary in Poland.” Despite those extraordinary appeals and warnings, Poland’s lawmakers continued to work swiftly on the legislation all through the night on Thursday and the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, approved it in a vote on Friday.  The bill will now proceed to the Senate, where the opposition holds a small majority. But even if the upper house rejects the bill, the draft will go back to the Sejm, which is controlled by the Law and Justice party and has the power to make it a law if it passes a second vote, as expected.  As lawmakers were introducing the legislation last week, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Law and Justice and the most influential political figure in Poland, said that the new regulations were necessary because the judiciary in Poland is in a state of “chaos.” “I hope that this project will stop the justice system from blowing up,” Mr. Kaczynski said in an interview with the Polish Press Agency. “Judges actually do not bear the consequences of even their most unlawful and harmful actions. This is a sick system and it is obvious that it cannot work well. Authorities must be responsible. If they are not, then they are evil.” The European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, warned in Brussels on Monday that the rule of law in Poland was being eroded and said the European Union was prepared to do everything in its power to defend the independence of Poland’s judiciary. Hundreds of judges, lawyers and prosecutors in Poland already face disciplinary proceedings as a result of their criticism of the government. Judge Igor Tuleya, one of the most vocal critics who has been the subject of several disciplinary inquiries, took the stage during a protest in Warsaw near Parliament on Wednesday evening. “Today is a challenging day. Once again the fate of free courts is at stake,” he said. “Not only are they trying to gag us, they are also trying to put us in prisons. And if this law passes, they will succeed. And if this moment ever comes that we are gone, please tell your children that once there were independent courts.” Earlier this year, local media reported that a deputy minister of justice, Lukasz Piebiak, coordinated efforts to discredit the judges opposing the government’s judicial overhaul by planting rumors about their private lives. His superiors denied they had known anything about the hate campaign, publicly condemned the action and forced Mr. Piebiak to resign. Ever since Law and Justice started asserting greater control over Poland’s judiciary four years ago, judges have been on the front line of resistance, voicing their concerns. Law and Justice introduced the first changes soon after winning the 2015 election, stacking the Constitutional Tribunal, a top court in charge of reviewing the constitutionality of the law, with loyalists. Soon after, the minister of justice merged his post with the job of prosecutor general, which gave the government authority over the country’s prosecutors. Next, politicians took full control of the National Council of the Judiciary, which is tasked with selecting judges, and moved to purge the Supreme Court of jurists over the age of 65. That would have included the high court’s First President, Malgorzata Gersdorf, who was nominated before Law and Justice came to power and is one of the main opponents of the government’s overhaul of the judiciary. The ruling party backed down after the intervention of the European Union last year, which came in response to an appeal for assistance from the Polish judges. But the Supreme Court spokesman, Maciej Lasek, said that if the new legislation is passed, it will allow President Andrzej Duda to pick a replacement for Judge Gersdorf, who is expected to step down in April. The Supreme Court rules on the validity of elections in Poland and Mr. Duda will run for re-election in May. In 2017, Poland’s judicial overhaul led to it becoming the first member of the European Union to have Article 7 of the European Union treaty invoked against it. Invoking the article, which is designed to protect the fundamental values of the bloc, is an extraordinary disciplinary action that could eventually see Warsaw sanctioned or stripped of its voting rights in the bloc.']",The draft law would punish judges who speak out on judicial independence. European officials say it continues the ruling party’s chipping away at Poland’s democracy.
How a Poisoning in Bulgaria Exposed Russian Assassins in Europe,2019-12-22,By Michael Schwirtz,"['SOFIA, Bulgaria — The Russian assassin used an alias, Sergei Fedotov, and slipped into Bulgaria unnoticed, checking into a hotel in Sofia near the office of a local arms manufacturer who had been selling ammunition to Ukraine.  He led a team of three men. Within days, one man sneaked into a locked parking garage, smeared poison on the handle of the arms manufacturer’s car, then left, undetected, except for blurry images captured by surveillance video. Shortly after, the arms manufacturer, Emilian Gebrev, was meeting with business partners at a rooftop restaurant when he began to hallucinate and vomit. The poisoning left Mr. Gebrev, now 65, hospitalized for a month. His son was poisoned, and so was another top executive at his company. When Mr. Gebrev was discharged, the assassins poisoned him and his son again, at their summer home on the Black Sea. They all survived, though Mr. Gebrev’s business has yet to recover fully.  The assassination attempts in 2015 were remarkable not only for their brazenness and persistence, but also because security and intelligence officials in the West initially did not notice. Bulgarian prosecutors looked at the case, failed to unearth any evidence and closed it. Now Western security and intelligence officials say the Bulgaria poisonings were a critical clue that helped expose a campaign by the Kremlin and its sprawling web of intelligence operatives to eliminate Russia’s enemies abroad and destabilize the West. “With Bulgaria, there was an ‘aha’ moment,” said one European security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence matters. “We looked at it and thought, damn, everything aligned.” Entering his third decade in power, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is pushing hard to re-establish Russia as a world power. Russia cannot compete economically or militarily with the United States and China, so Mr. Putin is waging an asymmetric shadow war. Russian mercenaries are fighting in Syria, Libya and Ukraine. Russian hackers are sowing discord through disinformation and working to undermine elections. Russian assassins have also been busy. In October, The New York Times revealed that a specialized group of Russian intelligence operatives — Unit 29155 — had for years been assigned to carry out killings and political disruption campaigns in Europe. Intelligence and security officials say the unit is responsible for the assassination attempt last year against Sergei V. Skripal, a Russian former spy in Britain; a failed operation in 2016 to provoke a military coup in Montenegro; and a campaign to destabilize Moldova.  Western intelligence agencies now know the name of the unit’s commanding officer, Maj. Gen. Andrei V. Averyanov, and the location of its headquarters in Moscow. Based on interviews with officials in Europe and the United States, it is also now clear that the assassination attempts against Mr. Gebrev served as a kind of Rosetta Stone that helped Western intelligence agencies to discover Unit 29155 — and to decipher the kind of threat it presented.   Since the original Times story, more information has come to light, including the true identities of some of the unit’s members and other possible activities in Spain and France. This month, Germany expelled two Russian diplomats as punishment for the daylight assassination in Berlin of a former Chechen rebel commander, though it is unclear whether operatives from 29155 were involved.  Security and intelligence officials are still working to understand how and why the unit is assigned certain targets. Even now, investigators have not determined the precise motive in the Gebrev case. Most likely, intelligence officials say, Mr. Gebrev was a target because of the way his business rankled the Kremlin: his arms sales to Ukraine, his company’s intrusion into markets long dominated by Russia, and his efforts to purchase a weapons factory coveted by a Russian oligarch.  Mr. Gebrev says he also believes that local business rivals or politicians might somehow be involved. “I have been thrown to the wolves,” Mr. Gebrev said in an interview. “But why and how, I’m still asking myself.” The poison took effect slowly.  Mr. Gebrev first realized something was wrong on the evening of April 27, 2015, when his right eye suddenly turned “as red as the red on the Russian flag.” It felt, he said, as if someone had dumped a bucket of sand into his pupil. The next evening, Mr. Gebrev went to his favorite restaurant on the 19th floor of the Hotel Marinela, a luxury hangout in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, where the clientele can pose for selfies with the peacocks wandering freely around the bar. At dinner, Mr. Gebrev began to vomit violently and was rushed to a military hospital. There, he began to see explosions of vivid colors. Then, his field of vision suddenly turned to black and white. As his hallucinations intensified, he imagined angry, fantastical creatures that threatened to drag him away. “I visited the afterlife three times, by my estimate,” he said in one of a series of interviews conducted over the past half year. “The doctors said they almost lost me.” A day later, the company’s production manager, Valentin Tahchiev, was hospitalized, too. Days after that, Mr. Gebrev’s son, Hristo, who was being groomed to lead Mr. Gebrev’s company, Emco, was also rushed to intensive care.  “When they get rid of me and my son, the company will be destroyed,” Mr. Gebrev said later. “Who would sign contracts? Who has the rights?”  For the next month, as Mr. Gebrev recuperated in the hospital, the Bulgarian authorities made little progress on the case. In a former Soviet satellite country with a long history of contract killings, the Bulgarian news media barely paid attention. The prosecutor general suggested that Mr. Gebrev had been sickened by tainted arugula. Eventually, though, officials concluded that all three men had been poisoned. In late May, Mr. Gebrev was released from the hospital and joined his son at the family vacation home on the Black Sea. There, the two men were poisoned again. This time, the symptoms were less dramatic and they drove themselves back to Sofia and checked into the same hospital for about two weeks.  Despite two poisonings, Bulgarian prosecutors failed to unearth any leads or evidence. Bulgarian intelligence agencies never reported detecting a Russian assassination team in the country, and possibly never realized it had been there.  “Anytime it’s linked to something with Russia, Bulgarian intelligence is very impotent,” said Rosen Plevneliev, who was Bulgaria’s president at the time of the poisonings. “Bulgarian intelligence is not willing to counter Russian intelligence and hybrid warfare.” When the hospital failed to determine the substance used in the poisoning, Mr. Gebrev enlisted a Finnish laboratory, Verifin, which detected two chemicals in his urine, including diethyl phosphonate, which is found in pesticides. The other chemical could not be identified.  By the following summer, the Bulgarian authorities had dropped the case. They apparently had no idea that Unit 29155 even existed. Neither did intelligence and security officials in the rest of Europe. Yet as Mr. Gebrev’s case remained colder than cold, members of Unit 29155 were very busy, according to partial travel records reviewed by The Times. From 2016 to 2018, operatives made at least two dozen trips from Moscow to different European countries.  Their operation in Bulgaria most likely would never have been detected.  Then there was another poisoning. In March 2018, a former Russian spy named Sergei V. Skripal was poisoned by a lethal nerve agent in the English town of Salisbury. He began ranting at a restaurant and fell into a coma before clawing his way back to life. It was the first recorded use of a chemical weapon in Europe since World War II, and it touched off a frantic investigation to determine the extent of the threat.  British prosecutors attributed the attack to assassins working for Russia’s military intelligence agency, known widely as the G.R.U. Working with European allies, the British authorities analyzed travel records of known Russian operatives. One stood out, a man using a Russian passport with the name of Sergei Fedotov. For five years, he had traveled extensively in Europe, visiting Serbia, Spain and Switzerland. He was in London a few days before Mr. Skripal was poisoned, leaving shortly after that attack, and British authorities have now identified him as the commander of the team that poisoned Mr. Skripal.  It also turned out that he had been in Bulgaria in 2015, making three visits: in February; in April, when Mr. Gebrev was first poisoned; and again in late May, coinciding with the second poisoning. Investigators from the Britain-based open-source news outlet Bellingcat have identified the man using the Fedotov alias as Denis V. Sergeev, a high-ranking G.R.U. officer and a veteran of Russia’s wars in the North Caucasus. The British authorities confirmed the accuracy of the report. The revelation that he was connected to the poisonings in both England and Bulgaria was critical in helping Western officials conclude that these were not one-off Russian attacks but rather part of a coordinated campaign run by Unit 29155. In recent weeks, another operation possibly involving the man known as Mr. Fedotov has emerged in Spain. The highest criminal court there is investigating whether Mr. Fedotov and other Russian operatives might have had some involvement in the protests that destabilized Catalonia in October 2017. Travel records show that he arrived in Barcelona a few days before the region held an independence referendum that month. During his visits to Bulgaria two years earlier, Mr. Fedotov was joined by other officers. For the April 2015 poisoning, it was two men using the aliases Georgi Gorshkov and Sergei Pavlov, according to two European security officials, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters. The man using the Pavlov identity also visited London a year before the Skripal poisoning, possibly in preparation for the attack.  Armed with new evidence provided by the British, the Bulgarian prosecutor general, Sotir Tsatsarov, reopened the case in October 2018. Almost immediately, investigators discovered fresh clues. Before the initial poisoning, Mr. Fedotov and two other operatives from Unit 29155 had checked into the Hill Hotel, in the same complex where Mr. Gebrev has his office. They insisted, prosecutors now say, on rooms with views of the entrance to an underground parking garage where Emco executives kept their cars.  In the garage, prosecutors discovered grainy surveillance video that showed a well-dressed figure approaching Mr. Gebrev’s gray Nissan, as well as the cars owned by Mr. Gebrev’s son and by the production manager. The figure appears to smear something on the handles of all three cars. Western intelligence officials have surmised that the substance was a poison. The surveillance video was described to The Times by two security officials familiar with its contents, but who had not watched it themselves. They requested anonymity to discuss a live investigation. This month, the office of Mr. Tsatsarov, the prosecutor general, confirmed the existence of the video — but said that its poor quality prevented investigators from identifying the well-dressed figure. Mr. Tsatsarov, whose term ended on Wednesday, has sent the video for analysis by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Travel information shared with The Times shows that all three assassins with Unit 29155 left Bulgaria on April 28, as Mr. Gebrev lay in the hospital imagining monsters trying to tear him apart.  There is little doubt that Mr. Gebrev’s profession — the manufacture and sale of munitions and light weapons — places him in a risky field, especially in Bulgaria. In recent years, the Kremlin has grown increasingly alarmed as smaller countries have nibbled away at Russia’s dominance in the arms industry. At a meeting in June with high-ranking security officials, Mr. Putin warned that Russia’s position in the industry was threatened. “New factors, complicating our work with our partners in military and technical cooperation — including competitive fights and increasingly aggressive use of unscrupulous methods of political blackmail, and sanctions — demand attention and an adequate response,” Mr. Putin said. “We need to do everything we can to preserve Russia’s leading position in the world arms market.” Bulgaria now sells more than 1.2 billion euros, about $1.3 billion, in weapons annually, a relatively modest figure for the sector, but a sum that has not gone unnoticed by Moscow. Tihomir Bezlov, a security analyst, says he believes that is what made Mr. Gebrev a target. “This is really big trouble for Russia,” said Mr. Bezlov, of the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia. “We don’t produce planes and tanks, but in this area of light weapons, this is serious competition.” Mr. Gebrev’s business grew out of the collapse of communism. When a scramble ensued for control of weapons factories, the new Bulgarian government blocked Russian buyers and doled out export licenses to men like Mr. Gebrev.  He has since moved into areas long dominated by Russia, including the Indian market, where he describes himself as “a niche player.”  “While Russia is exporting ammo worth billions of euros, we are exporting for millions or hundreds of millions,” Mr. Gebrev said. “But never mind, we’re winning tenders and they’re dreaming and thinking that the markets belong to them.” Emco, Mr. Gebrev’s company, also made sales to Ukraine, Russia’s enemy.  At the outset of Ukraine’s war with Russian-backed separatists in 2014, Emco signed a contract with the Ukrainian government to supply artillery ammunition, according to Sergii Bondarchuk, a former head of one of Ukraine’s state-controlled arms companies.  After Russian protests, the Bulgarian government canceled the contract in 2015, Mr. Bondarchuk said. In a statement to The Times on Wednesday, Emco made no mention of Russian pressure but said it had unilaterally halted sales to Ukraine in November 2014. Mr. Gebrev described his contracts in Ukraine as “peanuts.” Mr. Gebrev was also entangled with another project that might have displeased Moscow. Shortly before he was poisoned, Mr. Gebrev tried to buy Dunarit, a large arms production plant in Bulgaria coveted by a Kremlin-backed oligarch. A secret memo written around the same time (and since made public by Bulgarian prosecutors) detailed a Russian plan to transfer Dunarit to the oligarch, Konstantin Malofeev.  The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Mr. Malofeev for funding Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Today, Mr. Gebrev has recovered physically, though his business is still ailing. In August 2017, the Bulgarian Economic Ministry temporarily revoked his export license. The ministry is headed by Emil Karanikolov, who was nominated to his post by the far-right Ataka party, which has long faced scrutiny over its close ties with Moscow. Unlike many wealthy businessmen in Bulgaria, Mr. Gebrev has no bodyguard and prefers to drive himself. But he remains jumpy. Last fall, a surveillance camera at his home captured infrared images of a spectral figure with a mask snooping around outside.  “I would be the happiest man on earth if the poisoning didn’t take place and I felt sick because I had eaten some bad arugula,” he said later. “I don’t see myself as so important that someone would try to kill me.” Boryana Dzhambazova contributed reporting and research.']","For years, members of a secret team, Unit 29155, operated without Western security officials having any idea about their activities.

"U.K. Honors a Flawed Feminist Trailblazer, Nancy Astor",2019-12-22,By Stephen Castle,"['PLYMOUTH, England — When women finally won the right in 1918 to enter Britain’s Parliament, many expected the first female lawmaker to sit there to come from the ranks of the suffragists, the activists who had fought, often at huge personal cost, for the vote. Instead, it was someone of wealth and privilege, a well-connected socialite, and an American. A century after she was elected to Parliament, the achievements of Nancy Astor have been celebrated at several events, including one in Plymouth, the city she represented, where a statue of her was unveiled by Theresa May, one of two women to have been prime minister. Yet while Lady Astor was a trailblazing feminist, her political reputation was marred by anti-Semitism and by support for the appeasement of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, leaving historians divided over her legacy.  In terms of advancing equality, Jacqui Turner, an associate professor at the University of Reading, sees Lady Astor as a pioneer and someone of extraordinary resilience. “She opened the door,” Dr. Turner said. “If she had given up or said, ‘This is too hard,’ she would have set back the cause by a decade at least.” But Julie Gottlieb, a professor of modern history at Sheffield University, described her as “a much more problematic figure,” and the centenary commemorations have also provoked pleas for Britons to stand up against racism and prejudice. Lady Astor was not actually the first woman elected to Parliament. In 1918, the Irish independence campaigner Constance Markievicz fought and won election for a district of Dublin from a cell in Holloway Prison in London. But in line with the policy of her party, Sinn Fein, she never took her seat. Lady Astor’s arrival in Parliament in 1919 as a Conservative Party lawmaker was nonetheless a landmark, one that generated huge interest on both sides of the Atlantic. It was not universally welcomed, however. When she entered a crowded and expectant House of Commons on Dec. 1, Lady Astor suspected that many men would resent her but was surprised to be cold-shouldered by some she knew socially, including Winston Churchill. “We hoped to freeze you out,” he told her years later. They failed, but Lady Astor also received abuse that sounds wearily familiar to contemporary female politicians threatened or vilified on social media. “She got 2,000 to 3,000 letters a week from all over the country and the U.S., most of those celebratory and complimentary, but she also received hate mail,” said Dr. Turner, who added that one anonymous letter read, “To that blasted American whore: Go home.” Her remarkable story began in some hardship in Danville, Va., near the North Carolina border, where she was born in 1879. Her once wealthy, slave-owning family had lost its land in the Civil War. But her father’s fortunes improved thereafter, and he made serious money in the booming railroad business. Nancy married Robert Gould Shaw II, who came from a prominent Massachusetts family but had a reputation for wild behavior and heavy drinking. They had a son, but the union proved disastrous and ended quickly. She returned to the South until her in-laws asked her to grant a divorce to their son, who had decided to remarry.  On a trip to England for the hunting season, Nancy made an instant impact. She was outspoken, confident, witty and had a habit of flouting convention that seemed to appeal to stuffy British aristocrats. According to Dr. Turner, “One aristocratic British woman said to her, ‘Are you here to take all our husbands?’ to which Nancy replied, ‘If you knew how much trouble I’d had getting rid of mine, you wouldn’t be worried.’” But another appeared on the horizon (almost literally) when, on a trans-Atlantic liner, she met Waldorf Astor, son of William Astor, a fabulously wealthy Anglophile American who was eventually ennobled by his adopted country. The future Lady Astor charmed William Astor to such an extent that she and Waldorf were given a grand home near London, called Cliveden, as a wedding present. (Meghan Markle spent the night before her marriage to Prince Harry in the main house there, which is now a hotel.) Waldorf, educated at Eton College and Oxford University, was elected to Parliament in 1910 for the seat of Plymouth Sutton. But in 1919 his father died and he inherited his noble title — which came with a place in the House of Lords, Parliament’s unelected and less powerful upper chamber, and an obligation to quit the House of Commons. Initially hoping that he could find his way around the restriction, Waldorf urged his wife to seek the seat in the House of Commons. She not only won but held it until 1945. He stayed in the House of Lords. Despite her natural self-confidence, the early days in Westminster were difficult ones, and Lady Astor sat out a lonely two years until a second woman was elected. The men would rather have admitted a rattlesnake to the chamber than admit her, she later told the BBC. “It was a terrifying and paralyzing experience for her to sit in the House of Commons when surrounded by so many men poised for the attack,” wrote Rachel Reeves, a Labour Party politician, in her book “Women of Westminster.” Ms. Reeves added that, despite her apparent composure, Lady Astor admitted that she had been so terrified on her first day in Parliament that she sat for five hours without moving. Avoiding the smoking room and bars, she confronted the inevitable question of her clothing by adopting a type of uniform — a dark skirt, dark jacket, white blouse and tricorn hat — so as not to detract from her political activities. She pushed through a law to raise the drinking age to 18 — a restriction that persists today — and kept pressure on the Conservatives to legislate, in 1928, to allow women to vote at 21, rather than 30.  Straddling the worlds of politics and high society, she showed formidable energy. In an entry for 1934, the diarist Henry Channon described her as “breezy and funny,” though he then added: “She is almost a great woman, but I cannot like her. She is warmhearted, a whirlwind and a wit … but an unconscious snob and a hypocrite.” Her granddaughter Emily Astor recollects someone who kept in touch with her roots in Virginia and had a huge sense of fun. “She was happy, aged 80, to perform a cartwheel,” she recalled. The anniversary celebrations included one at Paddington Station in London, where a train was named after Lady Astor by the Great Western Railway. This was where she arrived in 1919 from Plymouth on her journey to take up her parliamentary seat, and where she was greeted by well-wishers, among them suffragists who had initially regarded her with suspicion. Paying tribute, Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of the suffrage campaigner Emmeline Pankhurst, noted how she was ignored “by all the men, including by those that she knew personally, because they wanted to squeeze out all women.” She added, “However, she persevered with humor and dignity, with courage and resilience.” Ms. Pankhurst also drew a lesson for the present. “Is it acceptable that systemic structural barriers continue to block women from becoming members of Parliament and that they are being targeted by particularly vile social media abuse?” she asked. Admirers at the unveiling of her statue in Plymouth included Frances Phipps, who runs a first-aid training company. “In this city, she is an inspiration to people, a local hero,” she said. Yet historians differ on how many allowances to make for Lady Astor’s support for appeasement and for other episodes, such as her decision in 1936 to invite Hitler’s ally Joachim von Ribbentrop to a dinner party. “She made some anti-Semitic statements, she was occasionally anti-Catholic, there were the accusations of appeasement and sympathies with Hitler,” said Dr. Turner, who added that some of these views were far more widely accepted then. “She was judged much more harshly than men,” she concluded.  Professor Gottlieb notes Lady Astor’s role as the hostess of what became known as the “Cliveden set” — seen as a political hub of appeasement — and her association with American isolationists like Joseph Kennedy and Charles Lindbergh. “She is a complicated figure,” said Professor Gottlieb, “and it is really important for this centenary to celebrate the achievement rather than the person.”']","The American-born Lady Astor was the first woman to take a seat in the British Parliament. A century later, her legacy is still being debated."
A Jungle Airstrip Stirs Suspicions About China’s Plans for Cambodia,2019-12-22,By Hannah Beech and Adam Dean,"['DARA SAKOR, Cambodia — The airstrip stretches like a scar through what was once unspoiled Cambodian jungle. When completed next year on a remote stretch of shoreline, Dara Sakor International Airport will boast the longest runway in Cambodia, complete with the kind of tight turning bay favored by fighter jet pilots. Nearby, workers are clearing trees from a national park to make way for a port deep enough to host naval ships. The politically connected Chinese company building the airstrip and port says the facilities are for civilian use. But the scale of the land deal at Dara Sakor — which secures 20 percent of Cambodia’s coastline for 99 years — has raised eyebrows, especially since the portion of the project built so far is already moldering in malarial jungle. The activity at Dara Sakor and other nearby Chinese projects is stirring fears that Beijing plans to turn this small Southeast Asian nation into a de facto military outpost.  Already, a far-flung Chinese construction boom — on disputed islands in the South China Sea, across the Indian Ocean and onward to Beijing’s first military base overseas, in the African Horn nation of Djibouti — has raised alarms about China’s military ambitions at a time when the United States’ presence in the region has waned. Known as the “string of pearls,” Beijing’s defense strategy would benefit from a jewel in Cambodia. “Why would the Chinese show up in the middle of a jungle to build a runway?” said Sophal Ear, a political scientist at Occidental College in Los Angeles. “This will allow China to project its air power through the region, and it changes the whole game.” As China extends its might overseas, it is bumping up against a regional security umbrella shaped by the United States decades ago. Cambodia, a recipient of Western largess after American bombs devastated its countryside during the Vietnam War, was supposed to be firmly ensconced in the democratic political orbit. But to win his place as Asia’s longest-serving leader, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia has turned his back on free elections and rule of law. He excoriates the United States while warmly embracing China, which is now Cambodia’s largest investor and trading partner. Down the coast from Dara Sakor, American military officials say, China has reached a deal for exclusive rights to expand an existing Cambodian naval base, even as Beijing denies military intentions in the country. “We are concerned that the runway and port facilities at Dara Sakor are being constructed on a scale that would be useful for military purposes and which greatly exceed current and projected infrastructure needs for commercial activity,” Lt. Col. Dave Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said by email. “Any steps by the Cambodian government to invite a foreign military presence,” Colonel Eastburn added, “would disturb peace and stability in Southeast Asia.” An American intelligence report published this year raised the possibility that “Cambodia’s slide toward autocracy,” as Mr. Hun Sen tightens his 34-year grip on power, “could lead to a Chinese military presence in the country.” This month, the United States Treasury Department accused a senior general linked to Dara Sakor of corruption and imposed sanctions on him. Mr. Hun Sen denies that he is letting China’s military set up in Cambodia. Instead, his government claims that Dara Sakor’s runway and port will transform this remote rainforest into a global logistics hub that will “make miracles possible,” as Dara Sakor’s promotional literature puts it. “There will be no Chinese military in Cambodia, none at all, and to say that is a fabrication,” said Pay Siphan, a government spokesman. “Maybe the white people want to hold Cambodia back by stopping us from developing our economy.” In July, armed men in military uniforms arrived at the wooden house of Thim Lim, a fisherman who lives in Cambodia’s largest national park. Leave, they demanded. Mr. Thim Lim said he was told by officials from the Ministry of Land Management that his home would be demolished next year to make way for a “military port built by the Chinese.” Other villagers who attended the meeting confirmed his account. Land officials wouldn’t comment. “China is so big that it can do what it wants to do,” Mr. Thim Lim said.  Mr. Thim Lim’s land is part of the Dara Sakor concession leased more than a decade ago to Union Development Group, an obscure Chinese company with no international footprint apart from its 110,000-acre Cambodian acquisition. The deal was questionable from its inception. With no open bidding process, Union Development was handed a 99-year lease on a concession triple the size of what Cambodia’s land law allows. The company was exempted from any lease payments for a decade. On Dec. 9, Gen. Kun Kim, a former military chief of staff, and his family became targets of United States Treasury sanctions for profiting from relationships with a “China state-owned entity” and for having used “soldiers to intimidate, demolish and clear out land.” While the Chinese firm was not named, rights groups and local residents said it was Union Development. Presiding over the signing of the Dara Sakor deal in 2008 was Zhang Gaoli, once among China’s top leaders. The company’s promotional materials call the development “the largest seashore investment project not only in Southeast Asia but in the world.” Even with generous lease terms, the one part of Dara Sakor that has been built, a resort complex, is languishing. On a recent day, the golf course was empty and the casino deserted. The marina restaurant attracted one Chinese family, which had brought seafood in a plastic bag to avoid paying resort prices. Instead of retreating from a faltering venture, Union Development has doubled down. The new construction at Dara Sakor includes a 10,500-foot runway and a deep-sea port able to handle 10,000-ton vessels. Who controls the venture remains opaque. For years, Union Development claimed Dara Sakor was entirely private. Yet Gen. Chhum Socheat, Cambodia’s deputy defense minister, told The New York Times that the nation’s civil aviation authority was running the airport project, meaning that it could not possibly be linked to the Chinese military. Sin Chansereyvutha, a spokesman for the State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, however, said that “we don’t have an agreement” for Dara Sakor airport. In May, Union Development handed Mr. Hun Sen, the prime minister, a check for $1 million for the Cambodian Red Cross, which his wife runs. The company’s headquarters in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, are decorated with pictures of Gen. Tea Banh, Cambodia’s defense minister, striding across Dara Sakor’s golf course. Union Development Group’s main office is next to the defense minister’s home. Less than 50 miles from Dara Sakor, another nearly empty Chinese-built development rises from another national park. The Sealong Bay International Beach Resort has sea views and Chinese chefs. But it’s the project’s neighbor that has been attracting the most attention: Ream Naval Base, Cambodia’s largest. “All these projects thrive off ambiguity because you’re never really sure what’s going on,” said Devin Thorne, co-author of “Harbored Ambitions,” a study by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington research group, on China’s maritime strategy in the Indo-Pacific. “You’ll have five Chinese port proposals; two of them fall through and then suddenly there’s one more next door. It’s really hard to keep track of.” In July, The Wall Street Journal reported on a secret draft agreement to give China exclusive access to part of Ream Naval Base for 30 years. Speculation about Ream intensified this year when the United States, which had acceded to a Cambodian request to refurbish U.S.-funded training and boat maintenance facilities on the base, was notified that the Cambodians no longer wanted the Americans’ help. “The withdrawal of the request six months later was surprising and raises questions about the Cambodian government’s plans for the base,” said Colonel Eastburn, the Pentagon spokesman. General Chhum Socheat, the deputy defense minister, denied that Cambodia had asked the Americans for money for Ream. “We are frankly fed up,” he told The Times. “Do we have to ask the United States to develop our sovereignty? Do we have to beg the United States to do this project, that one?” But in a May 8 letter to the Cambodian Defense Ministry, the American defense attaché in Phnom Penh noted that Cambodia had “requested U.S. assistance to conduct repairs and minor renovations to U.S.-provided facilities on the base.” In a response a month later, a Cambodian defense official replied that “the repairs and renovations of the facilities on the base are no longer necessary.” In a subsequent letter, Joseph Felter, then the American deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, warned General Tea Banh, the defense minister, of suspicions “that this sudden change of policy could indicate larger plans for changes at Ream Naval Base, particularly ones that involve hosting Chinese military assets.” The defense minister did not answer the letter. Mr. Hun Sen and his deputies accuse the United States of trying to foment a revolution against his government. In July, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill seeking to impose sanctions on individuals who have undermined democracy in Cambodia. Associates of Mr. Hun Sen, who has crushed his political opponents, could be among them. Two years ago, the Cambodian military suspended joint military exercises with the Americans and began partnering with the Chinese instead. Then, in a further sign of deepening military ties, Mr. Hun Sen announced in July that he had spent $240 million on Chinese weaponry. “If the U.S. Embassy, they don’t like us, they can pack up and leave,” Mr. Pay Siphan, the government spokesman, who is a dual Cambodian and American citizen, said in an interview. “They are troublemakers, and we see it when they look down on Cambodia.” “China is looking for our prosperity,” he added. “We are very good friends.” Sun Narin contributed reporting.

Sudan to Investigate Darfur Atrocities Under Ousted Leader,2019-12-22,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Sudan has kick-started investigations into the long, bloody suppression of the Darfur region under the government of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, a move aimed at ending years of impunity and bringing perpetrators to justice amid a fragile political transition. The Sudanese attorney general, Taj al-Sir al-Hibir, said Sunday that the government would look into atrocities committed against civilians in Darfur beginning in 2003, in the first indication that Mr. al-Bashir and some of his allies could face charges related to human rights abuses in Sudan. Mr. al-Bashir ruled Sudan with an iron fist for almost three decades — a tenure marked by human rights abuses, economic decline, and entrenched corruption. He was indicted a decade ago by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity over his government’s actions in the Darfur region from around 2003 to 2008.  His rule came to an end in April after a months-long uprising and just over a week ago, the 75-year-old former leader was found guilty of corruption and illegal possession of foreign currency and sentenced to two years of detention. He faces other charges including some stemming from the crackdown that left scores of anti-government protesters dead this year and his role in the putsch that brought him to power in 1989. Mr. al-Bashir was replaced by a transitional government that is working to put the northeast African nation on a path to a full-fledged democracy and lift it out of decades of diplomatic and economic isolation. The new government is also under pressure to redress the wrongs of the past.  After Mr. al-Bashir was sentenced last week, human rights agencies called on the transitional government to take concrete measures against perpetrators of violence in Darfur. But delivering that justice may prove easier said than done, given that some of Mr. al-Bashir’s most trusted confidants continue to hold prominent positions in government. “The transitional government of Sudan must demonstrate that the ongoing transition will not obscure past crimes and will take into account the demands of all populations in the different regions of the country, including Darfur, for long-lasting peace and justice,” Arnold Tsunga, director of the Africa regional program of the International Commission of Jurists, said in a statement. The Darfur conflict flared when ethnic minority rebels took up arms against Mr. al-Bashir’s government, accusing it of economic and political marginalization. About 300,000 people were killed in the conflict and some 2.7 million were forced from their homes, according to the United Nations. Sudan’s military has said it will not hand over Mr. al-Bashir to The Hague for trial, even as human rights advocates like Amnesty International have called for his extradition. So while human rights activists have endorsed the notion of regional investigations, they have also expressed concerns. “The victims in Darfur have the right to justice, and they will be given that justice if al-Bashir is tried in the I.C.C.,” said Amir Suliman, a Sudanese human rights lawyer and co-founder of the nonprofit African Center for Justice and Peace Studies.  Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok visited the Darfur region in November and promised that his administration would bring peace and help to the victims. Continuing violence and growing food insecurity there are affecting millions of people, the United Nations says. Among Mr. al-Bashir’s confidants who remain in power is Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, also known as Hemeti. He is a member of a prominent council tasked with the transition to democracy.  He has been accused of leading a prominent paramilitary force that left a trail of human rights abuse allegations in Darfur. He is also accused of the violent crackdown that left dozens of demonstrators dead in June. A report released this month by the Paris-based organization International Federation for Human Rights in conjunction with the African Center for Justice said Darfuri refugees in eastern Chad still suffered physical and psychological consequences from the war. They feel “forgotten and abandoned,” Mr. Suliman said. The victims, he said, are looking to both regional and international governments for justice and humanitarian aid. “We are closely watching to see where this investigation will go,” he said.']","About 300,000 people were killed in the conflict and some 2.7 million were forced from their homes during the war, according to the United Nations."
Afghan President Leads in Disputed Vote as Opposition Protests,2019-12-22,By Mujib Mashal and Fatima Faizi,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan was on course to win a second five-year term, the country’s election commission announced Sunday, based on long-delayed preliminary results of the September vote, which has faced protests and accusations of fraud. In a statement, the election commission said Mr. Ghani was leading with 50.64 percent of the votes over his main challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, with 39.5. Although the results were not final and the outcome could still take months to finalize after another layer of vetting, Mr. Abdullah warned that his team would not accept the results until its concerns are answered about more than 15 percent of votes, which he alleges were counted without transparency. The announcement moves a messy political crisis — which has bogged down the country for nearly three months amid a raging war and peace negotiations with the Taliban — toward a potentially dangerous showdown. Mr. Ghani, flanked by his running mates and surrounded by hundreds of supporters, celebrated in the presidential palace. He lamented the long delay and asked other candidates to abide by the election commission’s decision. “We pledge to create an administration that serves the people, answers to the people, and is inclusive of all of Afghanistan,” he said. “The delay in the election process created concerns for the people. The people bear the cost for any national process that is delayed.” Hours later, Mr. Abdullah addressed hundreds of his supporters at his palace, just down the road from Mr. Ghani’s, and said he did not accept the results. Weeks before the announcement, Mr. Abdullah’s supporters blocked nearly a dozen election offices across the country, with protesters holding sit-ins and preventing election workers from carrying out a vote audit. Regional leaders allied with Mr. Abdullah have threatened to forcibly take over provincial governments.  “With all our might, we will defend the votes of the people,” Mr. Abdullah said. “Based on the clean votes of the people, we are the winners.”  Mr. Abdullah once again accused the election commission of counting fraudulent votes in favor of Mr. Ghani. He said his team will take their concerns about the 300,000 questionable votes to the Election Complaints Commission, a last stop in the vetting process before a final winner is declared. “The damage of fraud and suicide bombing is the same to the people of Afghanistan,” he said.  This is the third time Mr. Abdullah has disputed election results after running for president.  A similar dispute between Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani in 2014 went to a messy stalemate that was resolved through a power-sharing agreement brokered by John Kerry, then secretary of state. That arrangement made Mr. Ghani president and Mr. Abdullah the chief executive. This time around, with American diplomacy focused on negotiating an end to the war with the Taliban, American officials and other Western allies have made clear they will not step in to mediate. The dispute is playing out as the United States continues negotiations with the Taliban to seek an end to the long war. In the fall, just as the two sides seemed on verge of a deal that would open way for Taliban negotiations with Afghans over power sharing, the election seemed unlikely. But when president Trump called off the talks with the Taliban, the Afghan the vote went ahead. A political crisis, or a bruising runoff if the vote goes to that, could weaken the Afghan government’s hand in any negotiations with the Taliban. An extended political crisis could also undermine military efforts against militants seeking to demonstrate that the government cannot protect its citizens. The announcement of preliminary results came after weeks of tense discussions to find a compromise between the grievances of Mr. Abdullah’s supporters and the position of the election commission. Among the roughly 300,000 votes Mr. Abdullah disputes are 100,000 ballots registered in the system either before or after voting hours — in some cases by weeks or months. The election commission attributes the irregularities to human error in setting the time and date of devices that recorded the votes.  Last week, as expectations grew that the election commission would announce initial results, Mr. Abdullah made a concession by calling on his supporters to allow the audit of the seven provinces they were blocking. He described it as a good will gesture to get the commission to reconsider its decision on the nearly 300,000 questionable votes. But the election commission did not budge. The election commission, particularly its chief, Hawa Alam Nuristani, has been under tremendous pressure to announce the results. During a recent argument in a commission meeting, she broke down and wept, according to three officials. Last week, nearly six hours of televised debate with candidate representatives turned into heated quarrels and ended with no resolution.  At one point, Ms. Nuristani got into an argument with the representative of an opposition candidate and walked out. “I am independent,” she said, thumping her chest as she left the room. “I have held the elections. I will announce the results.”  She returned to her seat later. Her usual calm restored, she took to the podium and explained that it was not the criticism that had angered her, but repeated — and often sexist — insults. Her outburst was also a telling indicator of the stress the election’s uncertain outcome had placed on the country. Her predecessor and most of the previous election commissioners are in prison on charges related to the unlawful mishandling the parliamentary vote last year. “I am not a traitor,” she declared, saying that she had led the process according to the law. “I am committed to my people. I don’t want to do something that takes me to prison. I want to go work honestly and go home.” This year’s campaign was marked by feuding and recrimination. The turnout was a historic low as about a third of the country’s polling centers did not open because they could not be secured or were in Taliban-controlled areas. The country’s election commission first said nearly 2.7 million people had voted in the nation of 35 million. But a month later, with little explanation, it revised the turnout to 1.8 million. The tickets of both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah were fined for using government resources and allowing government officials at rallies. Both sides claimed victory just as vote counting was beginning. Low turnout meant a relatively small number of votes could have swung the election. The commission decided to recount votes from 8,000 polling stations — nearly a third of 26,000 stations nationwide. But the protests continued. The introduction of hand-held biometric devices, supplied by the German company Dermalog, was intended to help eliminate rampant vote-buying and ballot-stuffing, which had marred past elections. But the devices complicated an already hazy vote-counting process in a country with unreliable communications and electricity. “Trying to get facts straight is a labyrinthine task,” the Afghanistan Analysts Network, a private think tank in Kabul, wrote in a detailed report as the dispute raged in early November. David Zucchino contributed reporting. ']",Long-delayed initial results of the September election show President Ashraf Ghani leading with a slight majority of the vote. 
"Putin’s Russia, Punching Above Its Weight, Keeps Adversaries Off Balance",2019-12-23,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Its economy, already smaller than Italy’s, may be sputtering but, two decades after a virtually unknown former K.G.B. spy took power in the Kremlin on Dec. 31, 1999, Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, have just had what could be their best year yet. The United States, an implacable foe during the Cold War but now presided over by a president determined to “get along with Russia,” is convulsed and distracted by impeachment; Britain, the other main pillar of a trans-Atlantic alliance that Mr. Putin has worked for years to undermine, is also turning inward and just voted for a government that vows to exit the European Union by the end of January. The Middle East, where American and British influence once reigned supreme, has increasingly tilted toward Moscow as it turned the tide of war in Syria, provided Turkey, a member of NATO, with advanced missile systems, and signed contracts worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia, America’s closest ally in the Arab world. Russia has also drawn close to Egypt, another longtime American ally, become a key player in Libya’s civil war, and moved toward what looks more and more like an alliance with China. It has been barely five years since President Barack Obama’s dismissive 2014 judgment of Russia as a “regional power” capable only of threatening its neighbors “not out of strength but out of weakness.” Its successes raise a mystifying question: How has a country like Russia, huge in size — it has 11 time zones — but puny when measured by economic and other important metrics, become such a potent force? “When the Soviet Union collapsed, everyone was asking the same question,” recalled Nina Khrushcheva, granddaughter of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and a Russia expert at the New School in New York: “How is it that such a rotten system punched so far above its weight?” The West, Ms. Khrushcheva said, has repeatedly misread a country whose ambitions are as immense as its territory — it stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea — and that is often untethered from what looks like reality. Mr. Putin, she said, “is at once a technocrat and a religious zealot, an exhibitionist and a master of secrets. You expect one thing, linearly, and suddenly it’s entirely something else, smoke and mirrors.” Under Mr. Putin, Vladislav Surkov, a longtime Kremlin adviser, wrote in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a Moscow newspaper, earlier this year, Russia “is playing with the West’s minds.” Also its own. As a reporter based in Moscow two decades ago when Russia’s first democratically elected president, Boris N. Yeltsin, handed power to Mr. Putin, I traveled to St. Petersburg, the new president’s hometown, to try to figure out what chance — if any — Mr. Putin had of ruling, never mind reversing, the bleak scene he had been handed. Russia was a mess, its economy still blighted by a post-Soviet collapse worse than the Great Depression in the United States, its military so feeble that it had lost a war in tiny Chechnya, its population so disillusioned with Mr. Yeltsin’s promises of a new capitalist dawn that it had elected a parliament filled with communists, cranks and crypto-fascists. A conversation with Mr. Putin’s former high-school biology teacher, however, quickly made clear that, as a popular Russian saying goes, “hope dies last.” She remembered Mr. Putin as not only a diligent student but also an exceptional basketball player because “he was very tall.” That the diminutive new president had grown in her memory to become a giant gave me my first glimpse of what, over the 20 years since, has been a defining feature of Mr. Putin’s rule: his ability to present himself and his country as standing far taller than objective facts would seem to justify. It is not all just legerdemain. “Maybe he’s holding small cards, but he seems unafraid to play them,” said Michael McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Moscow and now a scholar at Stanford. “That’s what makes Putin so scary.”  Mr. Putin acknowledged as much in an interview with the film director Oliver Stone. “The question is not about having much power,” he said. “It’s about using the power you have in the right way.” Mr. Putin has harnessed Russian patriotism, which he described in his recent year-end news conference as “the only possible ideology in modern, democratic society,” to achieve some real results, notably curbing the disorder of the Yeltsin era, along with the freedoms. He crushed a rebellion in Chechnya, which he visited just hours after taking office in a show of can-do bravado, modernized the armed forces and reined in — driving into exile, jailing or simply terrifying — the oligarchs who, under Mr. Yeltsin, had done so much to discredit capitalism and democracy. He has nurtured a new clique of obedient oligarchs loyal to the Kremlin. All the same, said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political scientist who worked for more than a decade as a Kremlin adviser, Russia under Mr. Putin still reminds him of a sci-fi movie exoskeleton: “Inside is sitting a small, weak and perhaps frightened person, but from the outside it looks terrifying.” Russia’s economy is dwarfed by that of America’s, which is more than 10 times bigger in dollar terms; it is too small to make even a list of the top 10, and it grew by around just 1 percent this year. Nor does Russia pack much cultural punch beyond its borders, despite excelling in classical music, ballet and many other arts. South Korea, thanks to K-pop and its movies, has more reach.  Yet Russia has become a lodestar for autocrats and aspiring autocrats around the world, a pioneer of the media and other tools — known in Russia as “political technologies” — that these leaders now deploy, with or without Moscow’s help, to disrupt a world order once dominated by the United States. These include the propagation of fake or at least highly misleading news; the masking of simple facts with complicated conspiracy theories; and denunciations of political rivals as traitors or, in a term President Trump borrowed from Stalin, “enemies of the people.” Whatever its problems, Mr. Surkov, the Kremlin adviser, said, Russia has created “the ideology of the future” by dispensing with the “illusion of choice” offered by the West and rooting itself in the will of a single leader capable of swiftly making the choices without constraint. China, too, has advocated autocracy as the way to get results fast, but even Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, can’t match the lightning speed with which Mr. Putin ordered and executed the seizure of Crimea. The decision to grab the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine was made at a single all-night Kremlin meeting in February 2014 and then carried out just four days later with the dispatch of a few score Russian special forces officers to seize a handful of government buildings in Simferopol, the Crimean capital. The temptations of authoritarianism à la Russe have found fertile ground in countries that long saw themselves as bastions of Western values like Hungary and Poland, and that had long histories of hostility toward Moscow. They have seduced voters elsewhere in Europe, too, and also in parts of the United States. Mr. Pavlovsky, the former Kremlin adviser, said he was stunned during a recent trip to Western Europe to have people tell him “how lucky we are in Russia to have such a brilliant and strong president.” “There is almost a consensus that Putin is a great man, a resurrection of de Gaulle,” he said. “Putin thinks this himself. It is not just an illusion, because it works.” Not all Russians are convinced, particularly the young in Moscow and St. Petersburg, who staged protests over the summer to declare that Mr. Putin’s time is up.  But the security forces quickly put an end to that, using often brutal force, and Mr. Putin’s approval rating nationwide, which had dipped slightly, is now back up to around 70 percent, according to an opinion poll published in November by the Levada Center.  This is down from the period of nationalist euphoria that followed the annexation of Crimea  but is still remarkably high in a country with stagnant growth and, for many, shrinking prospects. Heartened by the shifting winds in Russia’s direction, and his own, in an  interview with The Financial Times, he pronounced dead the West’s governing creed since the end of World War II. The ideology of liberal democracy, he said, “has outlived its purpose.” Russian mind games have been particularly successful in the United States, which Mr. Putin and his officials regularly accuse of paranoid Russophobia but whose fixation on Russia has only multiplied the force of its influence. Moscow’s efforts to sow division through Facebook and other social media platforms were low-budget and often primitive, but they have had a disproportionate effect on the American political process. The result is a state of fretful and anything-goes uncertainty, a condition summed up by Peter Pomerantsev, a Soviet-born British author, in the title of his 2014 book about Mr. Putin’s Russia: “Nothing is True and Everything is Possible.” In Russia, Ms. Khrushcheva said, “it’s not what is on the surface, it’s doublespeak, triple-think. That’s why we are so good at art.” When Mr. Putin first took charge after Mr. Yeltsin’s surprise resignation on the eve of the new millennium, he declared his commitment to a very different direction for Russia than the one he has since taken.  Bid farewell by Mr. Yeltsin on the steps of the Kremlin with a melancholy request that he “take care of Russia,” Mr. Putin appeared on television a few hours later to deliver his first New Year Eve’s address to the nation, vowing to “protect freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of the mass media, ownership rights, these fundamental elements of a civilized society.” He delivered much the same message a year and a half later in a historic speech, the first by a Russian leader, in the Reichstag in Berlin, sketching a vision of Russia as inextricably bound to Europe and its values. By 2002, however, he was already growing weary of Russia being viewed as a supplicant junior partner. “Russia was never as strong as it wants to be, and never as weak as it is thought to be,” he warned.  Bitterly disillusioned with the West on security issues, in 2007 Mr. Putin delivered a speech in Munich bristling with resentment and anger at American unilateralism and disregard for Russian opposition to the expansion of NATO. “They bring us to the abyss of one conflict after another,” he said, creating such insecurity that “nobody feels safe.” But the real turning point, said Mr. Pavlovsky, who was then working in the Kremlin, came a year later with the meltdown of  global financial systems. “For Putin this was a decisive threshold,” he said. “Before this he orientated himself toward America. Yes, he disliked in the extreme what the Americans were doing around the world, but all the same he saw America as the strongest economy that runs the world economic system. Suddenly it turned out: no, they are not running anything.” This, Mr. Pavlovsky said, “was the moment of truth,” when “all the old norms vanished.” Since then, he said, Russia has set about creating its own norms. “Reality is not a children’s matinee or the handing out of mandarin oranges,” he said. “In other words, things simply don’t look like you thought they do, like you wanted them to, like you expected them to.”']","Its economy is sputtering and its young people are frustrated, but with America and Europe in tumult, Russia and its leader of two decades are on a roll."
A Test for Foreign Teachers in Indonesia: Are You Gay?,2019-12-23,By Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — Agree or disagree, the exam asked: “I would feel uncomfortable knowing my daughter’s or son’s teacher was homosexual.” Or this, true or false: “The gender composition of an orgy would be irrelevant to my decision to participate.” In recent weeks, foreign teachers at some private schools in Indonesia have been required to answer these questions and many more like them in what has been billed as a psychological exam. The goal is to determine teachers’ sexual orientation and attitude toward gay rights under a 2015 government regulation that prohibits international schools from hiring foreign teachers who have “an indication of abnormal sexual behavior or orientation.” “For foreign teachers, if the psychologist declares that a candidate has a deviant sexual orientation, certainly the school will not hire that person,” said Waadarrahman, an official with the Ministry of Education and Culture. Like many Indonesians, she uses one name. The test comes as lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people face growing hostility across Indonesia, which was once seen as among the most tolerant countries in the Islamic world. Officially secular, Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population.  In September, Parliament came close to passing an overhaul of the criminal code that would have effectively outlawed gay and lesbian relations. A similar proposal is expected to come up in the new year. In Bekasi Regency, which adjoins the capital city, Jakarta, the Child Protection Agency said this month that it had used police records to identify 4,000 people who suffer from the “disease” of being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Promoting theories debunked in the West, the agency’s commissioner, Mohamad Rojak, told reporters that “the majority of sexual disorientation” was caused by “carefree lifestyles” and urged the people on his list to overcome their condition by getting “therapy.” The crackdown on L.G.B.T. people in Indonesian workplaces extends beyond schools. The office of Indonesia’s attorney general, which is responsible for enforcing laws against discrimination, last month said on its website that job applicants must not have “sexual orientation disorders” or “behavioral deviations.” “We just want the normal ones,” a spokesman for the attorney general’s office, Mukri, told reporters. “We don’t want the odd ones.” Homosexuality is currently not illegal in Indonesia except in the autonomous province of Aceh, where gays and lesbians can be caned under Shariah, the Islamic legal code. But the country’s new vice president, Ma’ruf Amin, formerly a leading Islamic cleric, has long supported criminalization and harsh punishment of gays and lesbians. The teacher-testing requirement was adopted after a contentious 2014 case in which a Canadian educator and six Indonesians were accused of sexually abusing young students at the prestigious Jakarta International School. All seven were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms on the basis of preposterous evidence, including that the Canadian, Neil Bantleman, used magical powers to seduce the children and render the crime scenes invisible. He was granted clemency in June and freed after serving five years. Officials say one purpose of the testing regulation was to prevent foreign pedophiles from being hired as teachers. But the psychological exam questions reviewed by The New York Times focus instead on sexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuality. Ms. Waadarrahman, the education ministry official, said the regulation applies to 168 schools, including the renamed Jakarta Intercultural School, that offer an international curriculum. Many of the schools attract wealthy Indonesians who want their children to have access to an international education with Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate programs. The Jakarta Intercultural School’s headmaster, Tarek Razik, declined to comment on the regulation or how the school handles the psychological screening of its teachers. The recent wave of testing has alarmed some foreign teachers who are concerned that schools or government officials are seeking to remove teachers who may be gay or lesbian. But teachers who were critical of the test declined to speak out publicly for fear of losing their jobs. Under the regulation, the schools are required to have a psychologist certify that each teacher does not have a behavior disorder or an “abnormal sexual orientation.” Enforcement of the regulation, however, is haphazard. Each school is left to hire a psychologist to conduct the teacher certification process, which is required both before a teacher is hired and every six years when a school’s accreditation is renewed. There is no standardized exam. The testing procedure is left to individual schools and some versions of the exam are more intrusive than others.  One school that administered the test last month was the Mentari Intercultural School in Jakarta. The exam included many behavioral questions, at least 38 of which dealt with sexual orientation and attitudes toward gay rights, according to pages of the test provided to The New York Times. While the intention of the regulation might have been to root out predators, many of the questions covered attitudes toward gay rights. For example, agree or disagree: • “A sexual education curriculum should include all sexual orientations.” • “Celebrations such as gay pride day are ridiculous because they assume an individual’s sexual orientation should constitute a source of pride.” • “Teachers should try to reduce their student’s prejudice toward homosexuality.” Many questions appeared to be derived from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, which is designed to assess personality traits and psychopathology. Other questions aimed to show where each teacher fit on the Kinsey Scale of sexual orientation. Many of the questions were personal. These were asked of men: • “I wouldn’t want to die without having experimented sexually with both men and women.” • “I can be sexually attracted to anyone in the right circumstances.” • “I am only attracted to men.” Mentari school officials did not respond to questions about the test. A psychologist in the city of Bandung, Ifa H. Misbach, said she declined a school’s request to prepare such an exam because it would be unethical for members of her profession to engage in discriminatory practices. “It is weird for me, in my humble opinion,” she said in an interview. “Psychologists cannot discriminate on the basis of sexuality.” She noted that attitudes toward homosexuality are very conservative in Indonesia, where being gay is widely seen as a choice, not a characteristic determined by birth. “It is different from American culture,” she said. “Every day they have to hide from a society that judges them badly.” Discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation in hiring is “against Indonesia’s constitution, and against Indonesia’s obligations under international human rights law,” said Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International Indonesia. The advocacy director for the Support Group and Resource Center on Sexuality Studies, Riska Carolina, said gays and lesbians face increasing government obstacles in many areas of society, including barriers to scholarships or high-profile positions in sports programs. “The pattern is clear,” she said. “If there are groups that are considered different, they get excluded instead of getting taken care of.” Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","Under a government regulation, teachers at some international schools face intrusive questions aimed at identifying those with “abnormal” sexual orientations.

"In France, Holiday Skating Rinks Are an Unlikely Climate Battleground",2019-12-22,By Mélissa Godin,"['ST.-MALO, France — On a recent morning, toddlers and teenagers laughed and shouted as they skated around a rink of shiny ice just outside the walls of St.-Malo, a city on the northern coast of Brittany where winters generally hover above freezing.  “Because our region has neither ice nor snow, it’s so magical for the children to get to skate like this,” said Corinne Doli, 65, who snapped photographs of her grandchildren as they glided around on the ice. But for others, as issues like climate change loom larger than ever in local and national politics, Christmas cheer is competing with growing concern about the environmental cost of holiday rinks. Though St.-Malo kept its rink, other French cities, including Bordeaux and Rennes, canceled theirs, citing concerns about the size of the carbon footprint needed to maintain them.  Even in St.-Malo, environmentalists contested the plans after the city announced in October that a rink would be installed.  “In an era where ice is melting all over the world, from Antarctica to the Arctic, with glaciers retreating because of human activities, it is quite ironic that we would use a lot of energy to recreate a small ice surface,” said Gerard Le Bars, a member of the local group of the Europe Ecology-Greens political party. The holiday skating rink may seem an unlikely environmental battleground. But in France, debates have coalesced around them in part because of ambiguity over their “Frenchness” — with some seeing them as an unwanted import. Though France’s first indoor rink opened in 1876, the proliferation of Christmas rinks is a recent phenomenon. Even fans of the attraction in St.-Malo, such as Melanie Laguerre, 43, who was watching her children skate, noted that it “reminds us of what we’ve seen in American movies.” If the holiday rinks are not really a French tradition, environmentalists argue, are they worth the high cost in energy needed to run them? That question echoes other debates in France about how the adoption of a homogeneous global culture can aggravate climate change.  On Nov. 29, for instance, there were some protests against the emergence of “Black Friday” sales — an American phenomenon — because of the negative environmental impact and the glorification of commercialism.  For residents of St.-Malo, the debate over the skating rink reflects a visible menace. Built on a jagged peninsula, the coastal city is threatened by rising sea levels and sandbags line parts of the shore. “St.-Malo could become an island with rising sea levels,” said Evelyne Ollivier, a local representative of the center-left political party Place Publique. “Because of this, we think it is irresponsible to create a skating rink in St.-Malo that emits carbon into the air.”  According to an expert quoted by RTBF, a Belgian public broadcaster, running an outdoor rink for a month creates  a carbon footprint equivalent to running about 200 refrigerators for a year. Environmental considerations are gaining traction in France.  Green and allied parties won 12 seats in the country during elections for the European Parliament in May. In a recent poll in the newspaper Le Figaro, 72 percent of French people said they had become more aware of green issues over the past few months, and roughly half reported having adopted more environmentally friendly habits.  As concerns about climate change rise, politicians at every level in France have jostled to align themselves with environmental causes.  But some say opposition to Christmas skating rinks is just political opportunism. Morgan Hector, organizer of the St.-Malo rink, said the attraction had welcomed some 20,000 visitors last year. “I think they have a right to express themselves on a subject that affects the larger public,” Mr. Hector said of the rink’s critics. But, he added, “These people are doing politics.” The origins of the holiday rink tradition were irrelevant, he said. “Is it an American tradition? I don’t know,” he said. “Is it a French tradition? I don’t know that, either.” Many in France are skeptical of small-scale environmental policies that target their traditions and ways of life — the “Yellow Vest” movement erupted last year when a proposed oil tax was perceived as disproportionately hurting the poor. In St.-Malo, Damien Chalmet, 34, was skating with his 5-year-old son.  “I think before canceling the skating rink, we should deal with cars in cities” and gasoline-powered buses, he said. Skating rinks, he added, are part of tradition and “the magic of Christmas.” Ms. Doli, the grandmother, said she felt much the same.  “It’s such a short time frame that the rink is open and it brings such joy to the children,” she said. “It seems a shame to get rid of it.” But Christine Bourquard, the local representative of the Europe Ecology-Greens party, challenged the logic behind installing the rink.  “Creating a skating rink in places with -20 temperatures makes sense,” she said. “But here in St.-Malo, skating rinks not only require a lot of energy but also do not correspond with local culture. So we’re creating something ‘cultural’ that is artificial.”  Other cities have already opted to replace skating rinks, with environmental concerns a prime factor. In Rennes, about 45 miles away, the authorities chose to install a carousel, deeming that more representative of the city’s culture. On the first night of the Christmas market in Rennes, families gathered under umbrellas to ride the carousel and watch the lighting of the Christmas tree. “I don’t see why we can’t find other activities that also bring joy but do not have a negative impact on the environment,” Noémie Connan, 22, said. Others agreed. “It’s great that cities are aware of that and are responding to these issues,” said Antoine Bidet, 21, referring to the ecological concerns as he strolled through the square.  He pointed to the carousel, adding, “We haven’t lost the charm.”']","The attractions have prompted environmental concerns, and some cities have canceled them, citing the size of the carbon footprint needed to maintain the sites."
"Breaking Ranks, a Rival Takes on Israel’s Netanyahu From Within",2019-12-22,By Isabel Kershner,"['OR YEHUDA, Israel — With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel politically weakened and steeped in legal troubles, a rival from within his conservative Likud party has emerged to challenge his grip on the party leadership. After two inconclusive elections ended with Mr. Netanyahu unable to form a government, Gideon Saar, a seasoned if staid party veteran, is running against him in a primary leadership contest on Thursday.  Mr. Saar argues that only a leadership change can save the party, and the country, from doom in the unprecedented third election set for March. “We see that we are going down in poll after poll,” Mr. Saar told supporters at his primary campaign launch last week in a wedding hall in Or Yehuda, a Tel Aviv suburb and Likud stronghold. “If we do not bring about a change, we are very close to getting a left-wing government, a government that will endanger everything we hold dear.” Elections in April and September ended in virtual ties with neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his chief rival, Benny Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White party, able to form a majority coalition. But polls show support for Mr. Netanyahu softening after he was indicted last month on bribery and other corruption charges, accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls for lavish gifts and positive news coverage. Mr. Gantz has not ruled out joining a coalition government with Likud but has said he would not serve in a government with a prime minister under indictment.  Mr. Saar, 53, is widely considered one of the next generation of Likud leaders, in line to take over after the departure of Mr. Netanyahu, 70, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. Mr. Saar has served as education and interior minister and tacks slightly to the right of Mr. Netanyahu, assailing him for not taking bolder action to assert Israeli claims on the occupied West Bank. But his chances of replacing Mr. Netanyahu now are considered low. He inspires little of the emotion and adoration many of the party faithful reserve for the charismatic, media-savvy Mr. Netanyahu, the maestro of political theater who brought Likud to power four times and has led the party for the past 14 years, and a total of 20 years in all. Despite the three criminal cases against him, Mr. Netanyahu still commands solid support within the party. Likud has had only four leaders since its foundation and rise to power in the 1970s. Likudniks have long prided themselves on their fierce loyalty to their leader, and have never unseated an incumbent before. Many buy into Mr. Netanyahu’s argument that he is the victim of a witch hunt by a left-wing elite that dominates the news media and has pressured the law enforcement authorities to pursue criminal investigations against him. Still, cracks are appearing in Likud’s united front. While several other would-be Netanyahu successors are waiting for him to exit the stage before making their move, the Saar camp has the endorsement of a handful of lawmakers and a growing following of local party leaders, committee heads and mayors. They joined hundreds of the party’s rank and file at the campaign launch, sitting under gaudy chandeliers at tables laden with sticky Hanukkah doughnuts. Classic Likud election jingles blared from the sound system and a group of activists tried to whip up the enthusiasm with chants of “Gideon, king of Israel” — a spin on a cheer frequently employed by supporters of Mr. Netanyahu, universally known as Bibi, who sing “Bibi, king of Israel,” to the tune of a popular folk song about King David. “Bibi did a great job so far but it won’t work this time,” said Reuven Peleg, 67, a businessman. “People want an authentic leader with roots in Likud and a clear ideology. Saar is the cleanest man I know.” Mr. Saar’s half-hour speech avoided any personal attacks on Mr. Netanyahu or any mention of his legal imbroglio. “It’s not relevant,” said Michal Peled, 43, a lawyer who attended the launch. “We came for something else.” Mr. Saar has tried to draw policy distinctions with Mr. Netanyahu. He derides the two-state solution, the internationally accepted idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, for instance, as a “slogan” and an “illusion.” Mr. Netanyahu grudgingly endorsed the idea of Palestinian statehood a decade ago, albeit with caveats, but has since retreated. And while Mr. Netanyahu has expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank and pledged to annex parts of it if re-elected, Mr. Saar says the prime minister has not been aggressive enough in pressing Israeli control there. Mr. Saar has made campaign stops at an unauthorized Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank that Mr. Netanyahu has pledged, but failed, to evacuate as well as particularly contentious settlement projects in and around Jerusalem that have also long been on hold because of intense international pressure. “Saar has elected to manipulate the 3 most problematic, potentially volatile issues to embarrass Netanyahu and garner support,” Daniel Seidemann, a veteran anti-settlement advocate, wrote on Thursday on Twitter. Mr. Saar, a lawyer by training, began his political career with a stint as cabinet secretary for Mr. Netanyahu during his first term in office in the late 1990s. As a minister, Mr. Saar raised teachers’ salaries, championed a tough policy toward unauthorized African immigrants and asylum seekers, and redrew municipal boundaries in remote areas to increase the tax revenues of poorer towns. His dour image was softened a bit by his decision in 2014 to take a time out from politics.  In a second marriage with a popular Israeli journalist and news anchor, Geula Even-Saar, he said he wanted to be home to see his infant son David take his first steps, though many analysts attributed the hiatus to tensions with Mr. Netanyahu, whose habit has been to cut down potential rivals. He announced his comeback in 2017, saying he had returned “to strengthen the Likud.” Mr. Saar won the No. 2 spot on the party list in 2008 and 2012, but slipped a few places down in February’s contest. Mr. Netanyahu last fought a leadership challenge against Danny Danon in 2014 and won 75 percent of the vote. Mr. Danon is now Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations. In an odd twist, Mr. Saar has had a run-in with a professed clairvoyant who belittled his chances on television and hinted at fodder for a negative campaign against him. The clairvoyant has now been threatened with a suit by Mr. Saar’s lawyers. Even if Mr. Saar loses, political analysts said that if he wins as much as 30 or 40 percent of the vote, he will be well positioned as a front-runner in the post-Netanyahu era. Mr. Netanyahu has been leaving nothing to chance, crisscrossing the country on a whirlwind campaign tour and holding multiple meetings each night at homes and venues packed with loyalists. He has accused Mr. Saar in the past of conspiring to oust him and some expect a dirty fight. Mr. Saar has requested cameras at primary polling stations and his camp has complained that thousands of supporters’ names had been struck from the voter rolls. Likud, which has up to 120,000 members, said many of them had not paid their dues. The night of Mr. Saar’s campaign launch in Or Yehuda, Mr. Netanyahu appeared in three towns in central Israel and recorded a Facebook Live video. “We will win big,” Mr. Netanyahu vowed, exhorting Likudniks not to believe the election polls that currently give a slight advantage to Likud’s main rival, the centrist Blue and White party and its allied center-left bloc. Across the road from Mr. Saar’s kickoff at the wedding hall, a ragtag bunch of about a dozen Netanyahu supporters were yelling “Bibi! Bibi!” stomping on a Saar campaign T-shirt and branding his supporters as “traitors.”']","With Israel’s prime minister under indictment, Gideon Saar is challenging him for the Likud party leadership. His chances may be slim, but he has cracked Likud’s united front."
"Notre-Dame Will Not Host Christmas Mass, a First in More Than 200 Years",2019-12-23,By Aurelien Breeden,"['Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris will not hold Christmas services this week for the first time in over two centuries, as workers continue to shore up the fragile building after a devastating fire.  The 850-year-old cathedral has been closed to the public since a blaze tore through the structure in April, destroying a latticework of ancient timbers in its roof, sending the spire crashing down and spreading tons of toxic dust around Paris.  Records show that Christmas Masses have been celebrated at Notre-Dame every year since at least 1803, after the cathedral was handed back to the Roman Catholic Church following the French Revolution, according to André Finot, a spokesman for the cathedral.  Mr. Finot said that the cathedral’s rector would instead hold this year’s Christmas service at the Église St.-Germain l’Auxerrois, a church near the Louvre where Notre-Dame’s religious services have been relocated since the fire.  “It’s very hard for everyone, it’s yet another blow,” Mr. Finot said by telephone on Monday.  President Emmanuel Macron of France vowed after the fire that Notre-Dame would be rebuilt in five years, a tight deadline that the authorities are sticking to so far.  Jean-Louis Georgelin, an army general nominated by Mr. Macron to lead the task force in charge of reconstruction, promised this month that a religious service would be held inside Notre-Dame on April 16, 2024, exactly five years after the fire, to “celebrate the work that will have been done.” Recovery efforts continue at the cathedral, which was added in October to the 2020 World Monuments Watch, a biennial list of cultural heritage sites that are in urgent need of conservation. The authorities caution that Notre-Dame is in an extremely precarious state and in need of constant monitoring to ensure parts of it do not collapse. The vault is still punctured by gaping holes, and the flying buttresses are propped up by giant wooden blocks.  But the most urgent threat to Notre-Dame is thousands of scaffolding tubes — remnants of renovation work from before the fire — that were welded together by the blaze, creating a mass of twisted metal of roughly 250 tons that is weighing down on the structure. Workers are currently erecting a 200-foot crane that will loom above the cathedral to help finalize the operations needed to stabilize that welded scaffolding.  New scaffolding is also being assembled. Workers will then use that perch to carefully cut the welded tubes and remove them one by one. Those operations are scheduled to start in February.  “The workers are very motivated,” said Mr. Finot, the cathedral spokesman. “Everyone is working relentlessly. They are really putting their heart into it.” The exact cause of the fire is not yet known. Investigators are focusing on the possibility of a short circuit in the electrified bells of the spire, or in the elevators that had been set up on the old scaffolding. They are also considering cigarette butts, which were found on the scaffolding, apparently left by workers.']","The Paris cathedral, which suffered a devastating fire this year, is still closed to the public as reconstruction efforts slowly get underway."
West African Countries Take a Step Away From Colonial-Era Currency,2019-12-22,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — A bloc of West African states took a step away from a French-backed regional currency that dates back to the colonial era, making a significant symbolic break from the past.  The president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara, speaking at a joint news conference with the visiting president of France, Emmanuel Macron, said on Saturday that the bloc was changing the name of the C.F.A. franc, used in eight West African countries, and renaming it the Eco.  C.F.A. stood for the French Colonies of Africa when the then-colonial power introduced the currency in 1945, though it was changed after independence to the Financial Community of Africa. It is seen by many as a relic of “Françafrique,” the unofficial system under which France exerted influence over its former colonies in sub-Saharan Africa long after independence. “This is a historic day for West Africa,” Mr. Ouattara said in the Ivorian capital, Abidjan.   Most of the criticism of the C.F.A. has centered around the requirement that the countries that use it are required to keep 50 percent of their foreign currency reserves in the French treasury. Under the agreement between France and the eight countries, this requirement will be scrapped when it becomes the Eco, as will the stipulation that a French representative sit on the currency union’s board.  Like its predecessor, the Eco will be pegged to the euro, which advocates of the C.F.A. said gave it stability. Abolishing the C.F.A. franc has long been a demand of activists across the region. Opponents have demonstrated against the currency, which is seen as undermining African countries’ sovereignty, in Senegal, Cameroon, Togo and even France itself. “It’s a question of dignity. We have to leave,” said Hady Ba, a Senegalese philosopher who has written about the C.F.A. He added, though, that the region did not have many “responsible governments” and so he was skeptical that this change would truly be in West African countries’ economic interests. An Eco had already been in the works — but for a different, and larger, configuration of West African states. Fifteen West African countries were due to introduce a new currency called the Eco in 2020, but Mr. Ouattara’s announcement will almost certainly kill that project, according to Ndongo Samba Sylla, the author of “The Last Colonial Currency: The Franc C.F.A. Story.” He said that in effect, the Ivorian president and the rest of the C.F.A. franc countries had “hijacked” the original Eco plan and, by keeping their currency pegged to the euro, had chosen to keep their French ties rather than establishing new ones with their West African neighbors. Mr. Macron has made several visits to African countries during his tenure, frequently speaking out against the crimes of colonialism, and on Saturday he described it as a “grave mistake” on the part of the French Republic. The change from the C.F.A. to the Eco will likely improve his image on the African continent. Today, there are two C.F.A. francs, one used in the eight West African countries and the other used in six Central African nations. Only the West African states will use the Eco. Abolishing the requirement for countries’ foreign reserves to be kept in the French treasury and the departure of the French representative from the currency union’s board were “superficial” changes that had no impact on countries’ control of their own money, Mr. Sylla said. “As we’re still pegged to the euro, we’ll have to have conservative monetary policy,” he said, adding that as he saw it, France still wielded significant power in the region through both the currency and its extensive military presence there.']",A bloc of eight countries will rename their French-backed currency and France will scrap a contentious requirement for reserve deposits.
What Should Europe Do About Viktor Orban and ‘Illiberal Democracy’?,2019-12-23,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Donald Tusk grew up inside Poland’s Solidarity movement, the workers’ revolt that combined with intellectuals to bring down the Communist regime in the face of a Soviet threat of invasion and then martial law. “Solidarity” has been a key part of Mr. Tusk’s ideology and his life. The workers’ rebellion, which began at the shipyard in his hometown, Gdansk, gave him, as a bored young man who was something of a hooligan, real meaning. Solidarity remains, he said in a recent interview, “my favorite word.” But it also symbolizes his greatest failure as president of the European Council, the grouping of the European Union’s member states, a job he has just left after a five-year term. Despite Mr. Tusk’s passionate pleas, sometimes awkward jokes and Twitter commentary, the European Union signally failed to show the solidarity he demanded on the biggest issue of the last five years — migration.  The crisis fed identity politics and populism in countries like Germany, Hungary, Italy and Mr. Tusk’s Poland, and helped set Britain on its path out of the European Union — another painful failure for Mr. Tusk, who had been fervently against Brexit.  “You can’t force solidarity,’’ Mr. Tusk, 62, said rather sadly, reflecting on his tenure and the state of Europe. “Enforced solidarity is an oxymoron.’’  But he said that was precisely what some of his European partners wanted to do. ‘‘This is why some countries were really angry,’’ Mr. Tusk said.  Some of these same countries, especially in Central Europe, are happy to accept European solidarity when it means agricultural and regional aid funds from Brussels. But the problems of migrants, borders and Islamophobia were all stoked domestically, with Brussels as a handy scapegoat. The conflict was particularly complicated, even emotionally so, with Mr. Tusk’s old friend and anti-Communist colleague, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban. And he is now even more Mr. Tusk’s problem.  Mr. Tusk has just begun a new job in Brussels as head of a center-right party grouping called the European People’s Party. Mr. Orban and his Fidesz party are prominent members, and Mr. Tusk’s predecessor did very little to rein in Mr. Orban, because the party needed his votes in the European Parliament. So what will Mr. Tusk do? Mr. Tusk is struggling to answer, because he has seen the transformation of Mr. Orban from an idealistic anti-Communist to a populist authoritarian, dabbling in Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and proud of creating an “illiberal democracy.’’ “I have a problem with Viktor Orban, but also a private one, a personal one,’’ Mr. Tusk said. “Because we have known each other for so many years and our friendship started when he was one of the most talented and promising liberal democrats in our part of Europe,” who stood up to the Communist authorities in 1989. “When I was president of the European Council he was my partner, and paradoxically, also because of our old friendship, we were personally very loyal to each other,’’ Mr. Tusk said. Then he hesitated, sighed, then said, “This is why it is something painful for me, because I like him as a person.’’ Mr. Orban is smart, Mr. Tusk agreed. “You know this is why I think he is cynical, because he is too intelligent not to understand what is the problem. And of course cynicism is nothing new in politics, but the practical consequences of his cynicism in Hungary are,’’ he stopped again, then said: “I think it went too far. At least it’s my opinion.’’ That opinion is shared by many, but Mr. Orban, by using his mandate to alter the Hungarian Constitution to his benefit, remains a powerful force inside the European Union and for populist, identitarian and anti-Brussels politics generally. His challenge to the rule of law is even more profound than that of the government of Poland. A request for comment from Mr. Orban was not answered. Once the highly praised prime minister of Poland, who resigned in 2014 to run the European Council, Mr. Tusk and his party lost the 2015 election to the populist Law and Justice party and its effective leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, now his archrival. As part of Mr. Kaczynski’s campaign against the European-minded heirs of Solidarity, he has even accused Mr. Tusk of being responsible for the 2010 plane crash in Russia that killed his twin brother, Lech Kaczynski, then Poland’s president. “Yeah, yeah, I’m a murderer, a thief,’’ Mr. Tusk responds, laughing. “I will survive anyway, I am quite experienced here, so this is nothing new for me.’’ But the intensity of the attacks represents something new, he said, a reflection of a broader problem with democratic debate he sees in Europe, the United States and Britain, over Brexit.  “It’s this shameless use of state-organized lies as a permanent tool and permanent method,’’ he said. Ten years ago, he said, “it would be something disqualifying for politicians,’’ but no longer. Now it cuts to the heart of the European Union’s idea of liberal democracy, shared values and the rule of law. And this is what is so troubling about the current trends in Central Europe, especially in Poland and in Hungary. “For me the red line is if someone is able and is ready to accept our fundamental set of values,’’ Mr. Tusk said. “We can describe this set with the simple term ‘liberal democracy.’ ”  That, he said, included a commitment to “freedom of speech, political pluralism, respect for the individual, tolerance, openness” — everything that used to be clear, and now is under threat. Still, he admits, the problem of Mr. Orban is even harder, because many in Europe, including Mr. Tusk, think he was correct in his strong defense of Europe’s borders against uncontrolled immigration, inspired in part by the controversial decision of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to open her country’s borders. Mr. Orban argued that Europe could not preserve the borderless internal Schengen area unless it defended Schengen’s own borders. He then reinforced Hungary’s with guards and barbed wire, herding migrants who tried to cross illegally into holding areas and refusing to take any Brussels-imposed quota of asylum-seekers, all to much publicity. “From the very beginning, I was absolutely sure that in some part of his approach he was right,’’ Mr. Tusk said. While despising Mr. Orban’s rhetoric, he said, he saw that “the conflict between Orban and Merkel was something really very substantive.’’ ‘‘At the end of the day,’’ he said, ‘‘not only the European People’s Party but the whole European family understood that if you want to have an asylum policy you have to be able to control the external borders.’’ What damaged Ms. Merkel was the sense of chaos and loss of control. But Mr. Orban understood, Mr. Tusk said, that “the first condition is order, absolutely.” And that brought Mr. Tusk, as a liberal democrat, to what he describes as his nightmare. “The biggest fear today, not only in Europe, is that people think that liberalism is a synonym for vulnerability and disorder and chaos and weakness,’’ he said.  “Liberal democracy must be also strong and decisive and sometimes even ruthless in protecting, you know, their own people, borders, territories, etc.,’’ he added. ‘‘If people start to believe that there is no possibility to combine freedom and a liberal set of values with safety and security and order, then we have no chance to survive.’’  Then, the field will be open to even more dictatorial populist politicians, he said. As for what he will do about Mr. Orban, Mr. Tusk refused to answer, citing a coming report from former party notables, including his predecessor as Council president, Herman Van Rompuy. Mr. Tusk said he will then make a formal recommendation to the larger party in February. But the politics remain awkward, Mr. Tusk admitted. “I can recommend some solutions,’’ he said, adding: “Of course, it’s a problem also because of this migration debate. Because almost no one in the E.P.P. wants to punish Orban because of this very context.’’']","Donald Tusk is leaving his job as European Council president, but he still faces the problem presented by his old friend, transformed by power and cynicism."
Syrian Offensive Sends Tens of Thousands Fleeing,2019-12-23,By Vivian Yee and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — As many as 100,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in northwestern Syria as the government of President Bashar al-Assad and his patron, Russia, have intensified a military offensive there in recent days, aid groups said.  Trapped between the violence and a closed Turkish border, the civilians are huddling in makeshift settlements that, in many cases, lack toilets or clean water. There is no foreseeable end to the suffering for the roughly three million residents of Idlib Province, which has been slipping out of the Syrian rebels’ grip, airstrike by airstrike, skirmish by skirmish, bringing Mr. Assad increasingly close to controlling the entire country again after more than eight years of civil war.  To the north, Turkey has sealed its border, keeping displaced civilians out. Other international powers have long since stopped efforts to intervene against the government’s advances, even as they call for political change in Damascus. The renewed violence comes as the government pushes farther into Idlib, nibbling at the last patch of territory held by the Syrian opposition — in this case, rebels led by a group linked to Al Qaeda and known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Syrian Army has been pushing toward the town of Maarat al Noaman in what appears to be an effort to capture a strategic highway to Aleppo, a major city in the northwest. The past few days have brought a spike in urgency and desperation for civilians in Idlib, many of whom landed there from other parts of Syria after the government retook their home areas from the rebels. Drivers and cars were scarce as people hurried to find a way out of Maarat al Noaman, which Russian and Syrian government warplanes have been bombarding relentlessly during the latest assault. Now they are homeless, sleeping under strung-up blankets, on sidewalks and in the open, amid olive trees, in near-freezing temperatures. Zein Samer, a photographer from Maarat al Noaman, said on Sunday that he had left with nothing, not even clothing. With his family’s house and shops destroyed, he had almost nothing left. “Everything is gone,” he said. “Simply vanished.” Before leaving, he visited his brother’s grave a final time. His brother died during a previous government assault on Idlib. “At that moment, I wished a rocket would fall on me and kill me,” he said. Since the military offensive in Idlib started in the spring, at least 5,262 civilians have died, including 246 children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group. About 400,000 residents were displaced in the spring, most of them moving toward the Turkish border, and aid groups warned that the number could soar if the current campaign continues. “I don’t want to think about what’s coming next,” said Mona Khayti, a social worker who arrived in Idlib more than a year ago after her home in Douma, a Damascus suburb, was destroyed by a government offensive last year. “Our turn is coming again, and I might be displaced again. The same scenes are being repeated here in Idlib, but uglier.” Humanitarian workers said conditions for the displaced were already untenable and would probably get worse as more people arrived, in northern Idlib near the Turkish border, looking for shelter.  Whether people are sleeping in informal camps or in the open, as thousands are reportedly doing, the settlements are overcrowded, and hunger is rampant. Medical organizations have reported that 11 percent of children who come to local clinics are acutely malnourished, and food has become so expensive that nursing mothers give their infants herbal tea because they can no longer feed them, the International Rescue Committee said. Residents and local aid workers in Idlib described chaotic scenes as people fled, with some elderly people refusing to leave their homes. “It’s really stressful and sad,” said Abdulatif Mardati, who works with a local Islamic charity. “These people don’t even know where to go, what direction to go. A lot of people fled with no place to stay.” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said on Monday that more than 80,000 people had fled the bombing in recent days and moved toward the Turkish border. If more people are displaced, he warned, Europe would probably see another wave of refugees — a reminder that Mr. Erdogan is refusing to accept more from Syria. He has repeatedly threatened to relax restrictions on migrants in Turkey who have so far been prevented from trying to cross to Europe. Though the border is shut, diplomats say Turkey will not be able to keep all those fleeing from crossing into its territory. “If the atrocity against the people of Idlib doesn’t end, this number will increase,” Mr. Erdogan said at an academic award ceremony. “Turkey will not be able to carry the load of migration alone. The negative of the pressure we would be exposed to will be an issue that will be felt by European countries, primarily Greece.” While a humanitarian emergency looms in Idlib, a vital channel for delivering aid to Syrian civilians has come under threat. On Friday, Russia and China vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have allowed aid to continue flowing from Iraq and Turkey to millions of Syrian civilians for another year, as it has done for the past five years. “To Russia and China, who have chosen to make a political statement by opposing this resolution, you have blood on your hands,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. But Russia’s ambassador, who had proposed an alternate resolution that would have extended the aid deliveries for six months instead of a year, said the humanitarian situation in Syria had improved. Unless a solution is found, the legal authorization for the aid channel will expire on Jan. 10. Rehana Zawar, the International Rescue Committee’s northwest Syria director, said four million Syrian civilians relied on the aid they received via Turkey and Iraq. “The Russian and Chinese vetoes of Resolution 2449 have put the humanitarian response in Syria in jeopardy at a critical time,” she said. “The Council must urgently resume negotiations on this matter.”']","Trapped between a fierce assault and a closed Turkish border, desperate civilians are huddling in makeshift settlements, bewildered as they seek safety."
"U.K. Security Service Can Let Informants Commit Crimes, Court Rules",2019-12-21,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A British court has upheld a government policy that allows informants of the British domestic intelligence service to commit crimes when it is deemed to be in the interest of national security, in a case that judges said exposed a tension between the rule of law and public safety. Under the policy, known as the Third Direction, officers of the Security Service, better known as MI5, can allow their nonstaff informants to engage in criminal activities when operating on cases of terrorism or organized crime, among others.  Much about the policy remains shrouded in secrecy: The MI5 has operated under the guidelines since the early 1990s, and the government only admitted the existence of the directive last year — even so, officials have not acknowledged any case where it has been applied. Four nongovernmental organizations in Britain mounted the legal challenge claiming that the policy was unlawful.  But by a slim 3-to-2 majority, judges of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the body that hears complaints about Britain’s intelligence services, dismissed the case on Friday, ruling the policy lawful and arguing that MI5 officers could not function without informants who could commit crimes, often while infiltrating criminal organizations.  “This case raises one of the most profound issues which can face a democratic society governed by the rule of law,” the judges in the majority wrote in the decision. They also ruled that the Third Direction policy did not grant legal immunity to informants, referred to by MI5 as agents or “covert human intelligence sources.”  “The sincere hope of those involved in handling an agent will be precisely to prevent an atrocity (or the commission of any offense) taking place,” the judges wrote. The four Britain-based rights groups behind the challenge — Privacy International, Reprieve, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, and the Pat Finucane Centre — said in a statement that they would appeal.  Privacy International’s legal officer, Ilia Siatitsa, said that the ruling amounted to legal immunity, as the informants would be acting with the blessing of MI5, which is under no obligation to inform prosecutors about crimes. “If no prosecution authority is made aware when such a case occurs, then de facto the informant has been given carte blanche to act as they like,” Ms. Siatitsa said in an interview.  A communications officer for the Home Office, which oversees MI5, said in an emailed statement on Saturday that the use of covert agents was essential to keep the country safe. “We are pleased that the tribunal found in the government’s favor on all counts and recognized that participating in crime can be a necessary feature of this vital work,” the statement read. The Home Office declined to comment on the number of authorizations that had been given or to detail the crimes that MI5 informants had been allowed to commit. Several European countries have suffered terrorist attacks in recent years, and the authorities have responded by toughening antiterrorism laws, increasing the budgets of their intelligence services, or making permanent the emergency measures that were put in place in the immediate aftermath of an attack. In countries such as Britain and France, governments have argued that increased security is crucial to avert attacks and to reassure public opinion, while human rights organizations have warned that additional measures can erode civil liberties. On Friday, judges made a direct connection between the Third Direction policy and the terrorism threat. “The events of recent years, for example in Manchester and London in 2017, serve vividly to underline the need for such intelligence gathering and other activities in order to protect the public from serious terrorist threats,” they wrote, referring to an attack at a concert in Manchester in May that year and to two others in the British capital — one in March and another in June. Last month, a 28-year-old man who had been convicted of terrorism killed two people in a knife attack in central London. It remains unclear which criminal activities can be authorized under the Third Direction, and to what extent; parts of the hearings were held behind closed doors, with lawyers for the complainants and reporters excluded. The court also issued a secret version of the ruling, in addition to the public one, according to The Guardian. Under MI5 guidelines, criminal activity “may sometimes be necessary and proportionate” to collect intelligence “that can be used to save life or disrupt more serious criminality.”  Intelligence services conducted the Third Direction policy without oversight until 2012, when David Cameron, then the prime minister, asked a retired judge to oversee the guidelines. Mr. Cameron acted shortly before he publicly acknowledged “shocking levels of collusion” by British security forces in the 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, a Belfast lawyer who defended members of the Irish Republican Army, during the so-called Troubles in Northern Ireland. Unionist paramilitaries shot Mr. Finucane as he was eating at home with his family. In the United States, a similar entanglement stained the record of the F.B.I. over its relationship with the Boston crime boss James (Whitey) Bulger. It was revealed in the 1990s that agents had used him as an informant for decades, while turning a blind eye to his offenses, including murder. He was ultimately caught and convicted, and was killed last year by fellow prison inmates.  Ms. Siatitsa, of Privacy International, acknowledged that intelligence services might have to allow operatives to commit crimes, but she said that the lack of oversight was ominous. “We in no way would like to stand in the way of the intelligence services’ job, which is to protect all of us,” she added. “But we live in a democracy, and nobody is above the law, not even the intelligence services.”']","The service, known as MI5, argued that sources sometimes had to be allowed to break the law so that officers could prevent more serious offenses. Critics say the policy offers de facto impunity."
Modi Defends Indian Citizenship Law Amid Violent Protests,2019-12-22,By Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India delivered on Sunday a strident defense of a contentious citizenship law that has fueled deadly protests, accusing opposition politicians of “spreading lies” and demonstrators of trying to destroy the country through vandalism and bloodshed. During an often combative speech in New Delhi, Mr. Modi signaled that he would not scrap the law, which favors every major South Asian faith other than Islam.  Critics argue that the law is glaring evidence that the government plans to turn India into a Hindu-centric state and marginalize the country’s 200 million minority Muslims. Mr. Modi, in his speech, dismissed the notion that the law was discriminatory.  “Respect the Parliament!” Mr. Modi said to thousands of supporters. “Respect the Constitution! Respect the people elected by the people! I challenge the ones who are spreading lies. If there is a smell of discrimination in anything I have done, then put me in front of the country.” Over the past two weeks, hundreds of thousands of Indians have taken to the streets in opposition of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which the Indian Parliament approved this month. The protests have drawn people of all faiths, concerned that the law undermines India’s foundation as a secular nation. Around two dozen people have been killed in the increasingly violent protests, and hundreds have been arrested.  The demonstrations are the most significant challenge to Mr. Modi’s leadership since his Bharatiya Janata Party rose to power in 2014. The authorities have been criticized for detaining demonstrators — including children — without legal recourse, shutting down internet and phone services, and firing live ammunition into crowds. [Read: ‘America loves India,’ Trump declares at rally with Modi.] Under the government of Mr. Modi, Muslims and others have been fearful about the rise of Hindu nationalism. Muslims have been lynched by Hindu mobs. The government stripped the country’s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, of its autonomy. It instituted a citizenship test in Assam, which it plans to roll out nationally. To critics, Mr. Modi is pushing an authoritarian agenda that threatens to erode the country’s secular foundation, shrink space for religious minorities and move the country closer to a Hindu nation. Long a dream of Hindu nationalists, the Citizenship Amendment Act establishes a religious test for migrants who want to become citizens. Muslim Indians worry that the government could use it to render many of them stateless. In his speech, Mr. Modi argued that the law was meant only to extend citizenship to religious minorities fleeing persecution in three Muslim-majority countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. He said that it would not be used against Indian citizens, pointing to development projects as a sign that the government extends public services without regard for religion. “If we haven’t asked your religion for previous policies, why would we ask your religion for this policy?” Mr. Modi said. “We never asked their religion. We only saw the poverty of the poor and gave them a home.” “I want to clarify once again that the C.A.A. is not going to take away anybody’s citizenship,” he added, referring to the law. “It is about giving citizenship to those facing discrimination.” But many protesters worry that the law would be used in tandem with a citizenship check to discriminate against Muslims.  The check began this year in the northeastern state of Assam, which borders Bangladesh and has a high migrant population. The state’s 33 million residents had to prove, with documentary evidence, that their families were Indian citizens. Approximately two million people — many of them Muslims — were left off the state’s citizenship rolls after that exercise.  The new citizenship law would most likely protect Hindus and people of other religions who failed such a test. Muslims, though, would be excluded. The Indian home minister, Amit Shah, has vowed in speeches to expand the checks used in Assam to other states and then use the citizenship law to purge India of “infiltrators” and “termites.” The authorities have already started building detention centers for those who cannot prove their roots. Indian Muslims, who were relatively quiet as Hindu nationalism reached new heights under Mr. Modi’s government, have finally erupted in anger. They have been joined by Indians concerned about the threat to the secular state, with protests spreading across the country.  Over the weekend, the demonstrations took another deadly turn. Residents across Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state and a stronghold of Mr. Modi’s party, said that the police broke into the homes of Muslims, took away hundreds of young men, vandalized property and beat people with sticks in the streets. Curfews and internet blackouts were widespread in the state, and the government instructed universities to track students’ social media posts. “The police came in the night, destroyed cars parked on the roadside, and broke gates to our homes,” said Mohammad Rashid, who lives in the city of Kanpur, where at least two people have died. “We are being treated like animals.” The police maintained until recently that no bullets have been fired at demonstrators, but videos posted on social media have challenged that claim. In one video, a police officer wearing a safety jacket and a helmet fires what looks like a revolver in a street where protesters had gathered. Moments later, a person shouts in the background, “Remove the cameras! Let them shoot!” On Sunday, Mr. Modi sought to quell consternation over the protests, characterizing them as fueled by his political enemies and “urban Naxalites” intent on destroying the government at any cost.  He beseeched the crowd to resist their “evil game.” He accused protesters of attacking school buses, targeting the police (whom he called “martyrs”) and spreading rumors about the fate of Indian Muslims. He made no mention of protesters who had been killed or injured. He denied that detention centers existed. The law “has nothing to do with Muslims who are made out of the soil of India, whose ancestors are the sons of Mother India,” he said, adding: “No Indian Muslims are being sent to detention camps.”  Evoking Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian independence fighter who championed nonviolent protest, Mr. Modi suggested that standing against the law “with stones” was a betrayal to India and part of a “conspiracy to malign the country around the world.” “They have an illicit intention of destroying the country,” he said of the demonstrators. “When you see bricks and sticks in the hands of the protesters, I feel pain, as does the rest of India.” Sameer Yasir contributed reporting.']",Prime Minister Narendra Modi stridently backed a law establishing a religious test for migrants that has led to deadly protests.
Istanbul’s New Mayor Outlines Gross Mismanagement Under Erdogan’s Allies,2019-12-23,By Carlotta Gall,"['  ISTANBUL — The new mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, has spent the last six months since his election combing over his city’s books to get a handle on how it had been run under his predecessor, an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Monday, the mayor issued his verdict: a level of mismanagement and overspending that surpassed all expectations. Things were so bad that the mayor even used a news conference to declare battle against one of Mr. Erdogan’s favorite projects, a $100 billion plan to cut a new shipping lane parallel to the Bosporus, announcing that the city was withdrawing from a protocol signed by his predecessor for what has been called Canal Istanbul. The declaration was the mayor’s first real challenge to Mr. Erdogan and the powerful vested interests that have supported him since he took control of Turkey’s largest and wealthiest city, long the power base for the president and his governing party. Mr. Imamoglu won a stunning upset to become mayor in June after the president’s party contested his apparent victory in an earlier election in March, forcing a rerun.  He took office promising to get the city’s books in order after mounting accusations by the opposition that the municipal finances had been used to the benefit of the president as well as his party, cronies and family.  In doing so, Mr. Imamoglu has quickly emerged as a strong national challenger to the president, whose popularity has waned as the economy slowed after a long stretch of unbroken growth.  Much of that growth was fueled by grandiose construction projects favored by Mr. Erdogan’s administration, the foundations of which the markets, economists and the president’s critics have questioned.  Increasingly, it seems, the bill on the spending binge is coming due.  Istanbul and its subsidiaries were in debt to the tune of 14 billion lira, roughly $2 billion, when he took over in June, Mr. Imamoglu said on Monday. The municipality’s subsidiary companies were paralyzed by tax debts and effectively bankrupt, he added. The outgoing mayor, an official appointed by Mr. Erdogan, had even received, and spent, a highly unusual advance of funds from the Treasury, leaving the incoming administration unable to pay municipal salaries, he said. “After a week there was not a single penny in our budget to pay personnel,” he said. At a recent budget meeting that was televised on the municipal channel, Mr. Imamoglu went into more detail, showing how spending had outpaced revenue over the last five years. Payment obligations, most of them foreign currency loans, had soared to more than 60 billion lira, or $10 billion, he said. “Financial discipline has gotten out of control from 2013-2014,” Mr. Imamoglu said at the meeting. “The past five years are a complete disaster in terms of financial management.” The discoveries by the mayor and his team have cast a harsh light on how Istanbul has been run under Mr. Erdogan, who has dominated the city’s affairs for the better part of 25 years, first as mayor in the 1990s and later as prime minister and president. Mr. Erdogan gained enormous popularity by providing public services from trash collection to mass transit. But he also oversaw enormous urban sprawl that critics say has irreparably ruined the fabled city. Those projects also made the president’s immediate circle of family and political allies fantastically rich through a system of kickbacks and cronyism, his opponents charge. Mr. Imamoglu, who is a potential presidential candidate for the opposition Republican People’s Party and is mindful of not alienating Erdogan supporters, has been cautious in revealing too much dirt about the previous mayoral administration or about the president himself. But Tarik Balyali, a member of the municipal assembly from the same opposition party, has been more outspoken.  As soon as the new mayor took office, Mr. Balyali, who serves on the inspection committee, went looking for answers in the municipality’s database. In particular he wanted to find an internal report on Istanbul’s spending on foundations and charitable organizations linked to Mr. Erdogan’s family, which governing party officials had denied existed. The report had been deleted from the database, but software engineers were able to retrieve it within a day, he said. “In the digital age nothing is secret,” he said. The municipality’s debt had increased fivefold in the last five years, Mr. Balyali said. Much of the increased spending occurred in the run-up to two election campaigns and was probably diverted to pay for the governing party’s election machine, he said.  Citing one example, he said that 185 million lira, or $31 million, had gone to a municipal gardening company two months before the 2018 presidential election.  “Clearly there was a need for flowers,” Mr. Balyali quipped.  “It was to finance the election campaign, propaganda, meetings and posters,” he added. “They had won elections in Istanbul for 20 years,” he said of Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party. “They thought they could do anything.” There was frequent overpricing of public contracts, Mr. Balyali said, adding, “Something that cost 10 lira was going for 100.” He described a contract in which the municipality agreed to pay more than the normal rate for 65,000 units of drinking water. “Where is that money going except into someone’s pockets,” Mr. Balyali said.  The true ownership of companies that won municipal contracts was often obscured behind a front person, sometimes the real owner’s neighbor or employee, he said. The really big money was in real estate and infrastructure development, and the members of the incoming administration found evidence of what they had suspected for years. Among the biggest prizes were an extension to Istanbul’s new airport, a high-speed rail link to the capital, Ankara, and Istanbul’s road and metro tunnels, each worth billions of dollars. Leaks of intercepted phone conversations published online in 2014 showed company bosses discussing the billions of dollars they were expecting in public contracts overseen by Mr. Erdogan and his transportation minister at the time, Binali Yildirim. In 2017, Istanbul awarded five contracts to build parts of the subway system. In total they were worth almost 1.2 billion lira, or $202 million, above what the municipality had estimated, Cigdem Toker, an investigative journalist, reported in a recent book.  The contracts were given to a handful of companies known to be close to Mr. Erdogan under a new regulation that effectively allowed for a closed process. Mr. Imamoglu said he was abandoning such practices, and has already saved money by canceling several expensive new projects that he said were unnecessary.  Among those are a solid waste plant, parking lots and a multibillion dollar tunnel along the European shore of the Bosporus, Mr. Balyali said. Yet Mr. Imamoglu’s hands are tied for many projects in which contracts are signed and work already begun, including several of the subway deals. For almost decade, Tayfun Kahraman headed the Istanbul Chamber of Urban Planners, a professional association, and he brought more than 100 court cases against the Istanbul municipality and its partners for projects that contravened the city’s building regulations. In September he joined the new mayor’s team.  The municipality was halting what it could, he said, including two road tunnel projects, and was considering using one for mass transit instead. As for the overpriced subway contracts, the city had no choice but to keep going, he said. Mr. Imamoglu announced that he had secured new financing in Europe and that work was restarting on three subway lines. The big battle on the horizon is Canal Istanbul, the proposed new shipping lane, Mr. Kahraman said. Mr. Erdogan has declared his determination to go ahead with the plan to respond to growing sea traffic from the Black Sea to the Marmara Sea. Mr. Kahraman criticized the plan on every level: social, environmental and financial.  He said he doubted that Mr. Erdogan could raise the billions needed to build the canal. But even if he could, Mr. Kahraman said, the projected costs of the canal would be enough to be used instead to make a third of Istanbul’s existing housing stock earthquake safe. He said municipal planning, which has been scrapped, showed extensive real-estate development along the route of the canal, suggesting to him that the project was predominantly a moneymaking endeavor. “You cannot bring Istanbul on this risky journey,” Mr. Imamoglu warned at the news briefing, “and a few people cannot bring things to this pass.”']",The declaration by the mayor was his first real challenge to the president and the powerful vested interests around him. 
Saudi Death Sentences in Khashoggi Killing Fail to Dispel Questions,2019-12-23,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia sentenced five men to death and three to prison terms over the killing of the Saudi dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, a ruling widely dismissed as punishing low-level agents while protecting their leaders.  The sentences, announced by a government spokesman on Monday, reflected the Saudi argument that the killing was not ordered by the royal court, but was instead a last-minute decision by agents on the ground — a narrative that contradicts ample indications that the agents arrived in Istanbul last year with an intent to kill and the tools to do so. While subject to appeal, the verdicts also raised the possibility that Saudi Arabia could behead the men who carried out the killing while shielding those who ordered it. The kingdom has denied any involvement by its crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and his top aides, who foreign analysts say were probably behind the killing. A United Nations expert who investigated the killing dismissed the verdicts as “a mockery.” The death of Mr. Khashoggi, 59, a veteran Saudi journalist who fled the kingdom and wrote columns for The Washington Post, caused international outrage and battered the image of Prince Mohammed as a young ruler working to open up his kingdom’s economy and society. It also caused widespread anger in Washington among diplomats, lawmakers and intelligence officials who saw the killing as an inexcusable act by a longtime American partner. But President Trump has defended Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed throughout, lauding them as key allies of the United States and loyal buyers of American weapons. The sentences appeared unlikely to change those views. The White House did not comment on the sentences on Monday.  Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said they were part of a Saudi effort to distance the Saudi leadership from the killing. “The suggestion that this was a rogue operation or a snap decision is contradicted by the evidence and common sense,” Mr. Schiff said in a statement. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island echoed an earlier assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency that Prince Mohammed had likely ordered the killing. “It is inconceivable that such activities would be conducted without the direction or blessing of the crown prince given that he effectively controls all levers of power in Saudi Arabia,” Mr. Reed said in a statement. The kingdom’s handling of the case has raised further concerns. Turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of impeding the investigation, and a United Nations investigator said the kingdom’s actions could amount to obstruction of justice. The trial, held in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, was shrouded in secrecy. The kingdom did not reveal the suspects’ names, and foreign diplomats who attended sessions of the trial were sworn to silence. Adam Coogle, who researches Saudi Arabia for Human Rights Watch, said that the opaque trial and the kingdom’s overall treatment of the case showed the need for an independent investigation. “Saudi Arabia’s absolution of its senior leadership of any culpability in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi raises serious concerns over the fairness of the criminal proceedings,” he said. “Saudi Arabia’s handling of the murder, from complete denial to hanging the murder on lower-level operatives in a trial that lacked transparency, demonstrates the need for an independent criminal inquiry.” Mr. Khashoggi, who lived in Virginia, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to obtain paperwork he needed to marry his Turkish fiancée. Inside, he was confronted by Saudi agents, who killed him and dismembered his body. His remains have yet to be found. On Monday, a spokesman for the kingdom’s public prosecutor told reporters in Riyadh that no evidence had been found that the killing had been planned ahead of time. Instead, he said, agents had been sent to Istanbul to “negotiate” with Mr. Khashoggi and decided to kill him after that effort failed. But investigations by the Turkish authorities and a United Nations expert found vast evidence of premeditation, such as the arrival of 15 Saudi agents in Istanbul in the hours before Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. They included a body double who sought to leave a false trail of surveillance video indicating that Mr. Khashoggi was still alive, and a forensic doctor who the Turks say arrived with a bone saw that was used to dismember Mr. Khashoggi’s body. Recordings captured by Turkish intelligence inside the consulate before, during and after the killing, and shared with the United Nations investigator, revealed the agents discussing how to fit Mr. Khashoggi’s body into suitcases. When Mr. Khashoggi reached the consulate, one of the agents referred to him as the “sacrificial animal.” After his death, no effort was made to resuscitate him.  The United Nations investigator also reported a vast effort by Saudi officials to cover up the killing, including by forensically cleansing the crime scene before allowing Turkish investigators access to it. On Twitter, Fahrettin Altun, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, wrote that the leaders who had ordered the operation had been “granted immunity.” “To claim that a handful of intelligence operatives committed this murder is to mock the world’s intelligence — to say the least,” he wrote. Although no evidence has been made public that directly implicates Prince Mohammed in the killing, an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency found that he had probably ordered the operation, which employed two private jets, two diplomatic facilities and the team of agents. Prince Mohammed has said that he played no role in the killing but that he bore some responsibility for it because it happened on his watch. An investigation by Agnès Callamard, the special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions for the United Nations human rights agency, concluded that there was “credible evidence, warranting further investigation, of high-level Saudi officials’ individual liability, including the crown prince’s.” On Monday, Ms. Callamard criticized the verdicts, saying on Twitter that the prosecutor had ignored evidence of premeditation and did not treat the killing as sanctioned by the state, which required holding top officials accountable.  “Bottom line: the hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death,” she wrote. “The masterminds not only walk free. They have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial. That is the antithesis of justice. It is a mockery.” The Saudi public prosecutor’s office said Monday that it had examined 31 suspects and arrested 21 of them. Of those, 11 were put on trial. Five men were sentenced to death for their direct involvement in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Three others were given a total of 24 years in prison for covering up the crime and violating other laws. On Twitter, one of Mr. Khashoggi’s adult children, Salah Khashoggi, who lives in Saudi Arabia, praised the Saudi judges as fair. “We confirm our faith in the Saudi judiciary at all levels and in its giving us justice and ensuring fairness,” he wrote. Months after the killing, he and Mr. Khashoggi’s other children received tens of thousands of dollars and millions in real estate from the government to compensate for their father’s murder. Turkish officials have identified the men they believe were inside the consulate when Mr. Khashoggi was killed, but it was unclear if they were the same men sentenced on Monday because the Saudis did not release their names. The kingdom did, however, identify three suspects who were not sentenced.  Ahmed Asseri, the deputy head of Saudi intelligence, who Saudi officials initially said had overseen the operation, was released without charge. Mohammed al-Otaibi, the Saudi consul in Istanbul who gave reporters a tour of the consulate days after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, was also released.  And Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Prince Mohammed, was not put on trial because the prosecutor’s office said there was a lack of evidence against him. The exonerations of Mr. al-Otaibi and Mr. al-Qahtani are likely to rankle the United States, which imposed sanctions on them for their roles in the killing. On Monday, Saudi Twitter accounts published what appeared to be coordinated posts voicing the Saudi people’s trust in Mr. Asseri and Mr. al-Qahtani. The sentences announced Monday were preliminary and are subject to appeal. Death sentences in Saudi Arabia are usually carried out by beheading in public squares.

"As Rail Strike Upends Holiday Plans in France, a Fight Over Blame",2019-12-23,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['PARIS — There was just one day left before Christmas Eve, and the mood inside the Gare de Lyon train station in Paris on Monday was tense.  Travelers, many with shopping bags laden with gifts, were waiting for trains that might never come. Striking rail workers suddenly marched into the station, chanting noisily, followed a few minutes later by scores of police officers in riot gear. “Usually, 15 of us get together for Christmas, but this year it’s just going to be my wife and me,” said Florian Cercea, 28, whose train had been delayed by several hours. “Christmas comes only once a year, and it’s very important for my family.” He added: “It’s going to be a sad Christmas. It means, even if we have presents, we can’t give them to the children. I guess we’ll give them next year after the strike is over.” Exactly when the strike — over the government’s push to overhaul the nation’s generous pension system — might end remains up in the air. Despite President Emmanuel Macron’s call for a “truce"" during the holidays, the three-week general strike that has crippled transportation in France and already hurt its economy has now upended people’s plans. In the final countdown to Christmas, the work stoppage was jeopardizing traditional family gatherings and meals of roasted capon for travelers in the Gare de Lyon and elsewhere across France. “Because of the strike, I might end up with no holiday or meal,” said Michel Esmingeot, 65, who had walked five miles to the station only to find that his train was delayed by several hours. “I’m not even sure there is a train. I’ll sleep in the train station if I have to and try again tomorrow. I don’t want to end up alone on Christmas.” Late last week, government officials and labor union leaders failed to reach an agreement to end one of the biggest general strikes in decades. Since Dec. 5, it has shut down most of Paris’s public transportation network, forcing thousands to squeeze into the few running trains, or to commute by bike and scooter or on foot. Transportation workers have taken the lead against the government’s plans to eliminate special retirement plans and create a universal points-based system, as part of an effort to encourage the French to work longer.  After meeting with the government last week, Philippe Martinez, the head of the General Confederation of Labor, one of the largest unions opposed to the changes, gave no indication of backing down and demanded the withdrawal of the government’s plans. “We haven’t changed course,” Mr. Martinez said. Union leaders have scheduled a national day of strike on Jan. 9. But some labor officials said it was necessary to keep up the pressure during the holidays. On Monday, hundreds of strikers protested near the Gare de Lyon, and some set off smoke bombs inside the metro station and clashed with the riot police. Despite the inconvenience, the majority of the French population remained behind the strikers, though the level of support has dipped a couple of percentage points. According to a poll published Sunday in Le Journal du Dimanche, 51 percent backed the strike and 34 percent were opposed, with the rest expressing no opinion. In a continuing battle over public opinion, both the government and the unions have tried to capitalize on the public’s frustrations over the holiday disruptions. Over the weekend, the national railway company and the unions pointed fingers at each other when rail officials announced the cancellation of a service allowing children to travel alone on certain trains. Company officials said that a lack of personnel because of the strike had given them no choice. Union officials said that workers accompanying the children were contractors who were not on strike, and accused company officials of “using children and their families to try to discredit” the strikers. The Christmas plans of at least 5,000 children were at stake. The railroad company eventually announced that it had secured 14 TGV trains to transport the children from Paris to Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux and other cities. Mr. Macron, who was in Ivory Coast over the weekend as part of a visit to West Africa, tried to take credit. “Solutions were found in response to our demands, in particular for the young children traveling alone,” Mr. Macron said at a news conference in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s economic capital. Mr. Macron said the Constitution allowed the unions to strike. “But I believe that there are moments in the life of a nation when it’s also good to know how to call a truce to respect families and the lives of families,” he said, adding that respect was due those who “were separated and want to get together during the holidays.” On Monday, only two of five TGV trains were operating, with regional express trains also having limited service. At the Gare de Lyon train station, many travelers were unsure whether they would make it to their final destinations. “It’s already a miracle that I was able to come here this morning,” said Samir Abdou-Eid, 68, who had managed to squeeze into a crowded commuter train from a suburb to the station, but arrived to find that his morning train to Montargis, about two hours southeast of Paris, had been canceled. He was not sure whether there was another train for him. “I’ll sleep tonight in the station if I have to,” said Mr. Abdou-Eid, a bag filled with chocolates and a cuddly toy rabbit and bear for his grandchildren at his feet. “I want to spend Christmas with them.”  Asked about the strikers, Mr. Abdou-Eid held his nose and said, “No comment.” Others expressed support for the strikers even though their holidays had been severely affected. The strike had wreaked havoc with Eric and Yolaine Ramond’s plans to travel six days earlier, forcing them to adjust twice.  On Monday, they were finally able to take a TGV from their home in Valenciennes, in the north of France, to Paris, where they were hoping to catch a train south for a family gathering. “We’re just a week late,” Mr. Ramond, 58, said, adding, however, that he fully supported the transportation strikers. “The government is trying to rob them of something,” he said, referring to a special pension plan enjoyed by some transportation workers. “So they have to show that they’re not sheep. Of course, it’s inconveniencing us, but I support their right to strike.” “It’s the only way for them to be heard,"" Ms. Ramond, 57, said, though she added that she had been “frustrated” by the six-day delay. “I was fine,"" her husband said. “As long as we get there, it’s fine — but not after the holidays.”']","With no Christmas truce in the long strike, many travelers can’t get to family gatherings, and the government and unions are pointing fingers at each other."
New Russian Method to Silence Dissent: Military Service in the Arctic,2019-12-24,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — After trying a number of methods to silence the dissident Aleksei A. Navalny and his supporters, the Russian authorities tried something new this week: They seized one of his key allies, put him into compulsory military service and sent him to the Arctic. Ruslan Shaveddinov, 23, a project manager in Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained on Monday at his apartment in Moscow. His cellphone’s SIM card was disabled, Mr. Navalny said, so he couldn’t tell his colleagues or lawyer what was happening. Mr. Navalny’s allies quickly raised the alarm that night, after it appeared that Mr. Shaveddinov had gone missing and they found the door to his apartment smashed in.  The organization’s lawyers and activists — many of them familiar with harassment by the authorities — braced to find Mr. Shaveddinov at a police station, and even filed a missing-person report. But on Tuesday they learned that he was 3,500 miles away, in Novaya Zemlya, a desolate, scantly populated group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, where he will serve at an air defense base.  Mr. Navalny, the most prominent Kremlin critic in a country where open political dissent is rare and often dangerous, blamed the man atop the Kremlin hierarchy, President Vladimir V. Putin. “Looks like Mr. Putin himself drafted the plan to isolate our Ruslan,” Mr. Navalny wrote on Twitter. “I am impressed by the scale of the means and efforts used: His SIM card was disabled; the F.S.B. broke the door,” he added, referring to Russia’s powerful security agency. “Within a day he was taken on several airplanes to Novaya Zemlya.”  The archipelago, with two main islands, is an area of severe climate, where even in August temperatures rarely climb above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. About a quarter of its territory is permanently covered by ice. During Soviet times, it was the primary nuclear weapons testing site for the army. The most powerful nuclear weapon ever created, known as the Czar bomb, was tested there in 1961.  Military service is mandatory in Russia for male citizens, who are drafted for one year, some time after turning 18 and before turning 28. The conscripts are often sent to remote areas away from home, where they are subjected to brutal hazing and bullying by more senior soldiers.  In October, Ramil Shamsutdinov, a Russian conscript, killed eight fellow servicemen at a military base in eastern Siberia. After the shooting, Mr. Shamsutdinov told his lawyer that the conditions in his military unit were similar to ones found in prison and that officers deprived him of sleep for days and forced him to clean toilets, URA.ru, a Russian news website, reported. Scared of the army’s reputation, many young Russians try to use all means available to avoid being drafted. Mr. Shaveddinov appealed the military commission’s decision to draft him in court, arguing that he had not been properly examined by doctors. After a district court in Moscow ruled against him in November, he filed an appeal in the city court. On Monday, the day Mr. Shaveddinov was detained, Moscow city court upheld the lower court’s decision.  “Military service has turned into a mechanism of imprisonment,” Mr. Navalny wrote on Twitter after Mr. Shaveddinov’s induction. “Just a way to deprive people of freedom.”  Over the years, the Russian authorities have tried a number of methods to silence Mr. Navalny and his allies. They have been jailed, fined and attacked on the streets by strangers, and their homes and offices have been searched. In October, the country’s Justice Ministry classified the Anti-Corruption Foundation as a “foreign agent,” a label often used to stigmatize anti-Kremlin groups in Russia.

Japan Wants to Dump Nuclear Plant’s Tainted Water. Fishermen Fear the Worst.,2019-12-23,By Motoko Rich and Makiko Inoue,"['IWAKI, Japan — The overpowering earthquake and tsunami that ripped through northern Japan in March 2011 took so much from Tatsuo Niitsuma, a commercial fisherman in this coastal city in Fukushima Prefecture. The tsunami pulverized his fishing boat. It demolished his home. Most devastating of all, it took the life of his daughter. Now, nearly nine years after the disaster, Mr. Niitsuma, 77, is at risk of losing his entire livelihood, too, as the government considers releasing tainted water from a nuclear power plant destroyed by the tsunami’s waves. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet and the Tokyo Electric Power Company — the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, where a triple meltdown led to the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl — must decide what to do with more than one million tons of contaminated water stored in about 1,000 giant tanks on the plant site. On Monday, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry proposed gradually releasing the water into the ocean or allowing it to evaporate, saying a controlled discharge into the sea would “stably dilute and disperse” it. The ministry ruled out alternatives like continuing to store it in tanks or injecting it deep into the ground. Mr. Abe’s cabinet will make the final decision. The water becomes contaminated as it is pumped through the reactors to cool melted fuel that is still too hot and radioactive to remove. For years, the power company, known as Tepco, said that treatment of the water — which involves sending it through a powerful filtration system to remove most radioactive material — was making it safe to release.  But it is actually more radioactive than the authorities have previously publicized. Officials say that it will be treated again, and that it will then be safe for release. Regardless of government assurances, if the water is discharged into the sea, it will most likely destroy the livelihoods of hundreds of fishermen like Mr. Niitsuma. Consumers are already worried about the safety of Fukushima seafood, and dumping the water would compound the fears. It would “kill the industry and take away the life of the boats,” he said. “The fish won’t sell.” With Fukushima preparing to host baseball games during the Summer Olympics next year, and the plant running out of land on which to build storage tanks, the debate has taken on a sense of urgency. Until last year, Tepco indicated that with the vast majority of the water, all but one type of radioactive material — tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that experts say poses a relatively low risk to human health — had been removed to levels deemed safe for discharge under Japanese government standards. But last summer, the power company acknowledged that only about a fifth of the stored water had been effectively treated. Last month, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry briefed reporters and diplomats about the water stored in Fukushima. More than three-quarters of it, the ministry said, still contains radioactive material other than tritium — and at higher levels than the government considers safe for human health. The authorities say that in the early years of processing the deluge of water flowing through the reactors, Tepco did not change filters in the decontamination system frequently enough. The company said it would re-treat the water to filter out the bulk of the nuclear particles, making it safe to release into the ocean. Some experts and local residents say it is difficult to trust such assurances. “The government and Tepco were hiding the fact that the water was still contaminated,” said Kazuyoshi Satoh, a member of the city assembly in Iwaki. “Because next year is the Tokyo Olympics, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to present the image that everything is ‘under control,’” said Mr. Satoh, referring to a speech by the Japanese leader to the International Olympic Committee when Tokyo was bidding to host the 2020 Games.  The power company acknowledged that it had not made it easy for the public to get information. The water treatment data “has not been presented in a manner that is easy to understand,” said Ryounosuke Takanori, a Tepco spokesman. “As long as the water was stored in the tanks, we thought it didn’t matter whether the water” exceeded safety standards for discharge, said Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager in the Fukushima Daiichi decontamination and decommissioning office.  Mr. Niitsuma, for whom fishing is not just a livelihood but also a balm against grief over the loss of his daughter, said he thought both Tepco and the government needed to come clean. “I want them to see the reality squarely and disclose information fully,” said Mr. Niitsuma, who goes out alone on his two-ton boat at dawn three times a week. His wife, Yoko, waits on the pier. On a recent morning, she helped drag the nets out of the boat and dump squirming octopus, flounder and a few red gurnard into buckets that the couple loaded onto a small flatbed truck to drive to a warehouse where wholesalers bid on the fish. Mrs. Niitsuma said she didn’t believe the government was looking out for Fukushima’s fishing families. “They are talking about discharging the water,” she said. “That itself means they are not thinking about us.” The question of whether the water could be decontaminated to safe levels is a matter of degree, scientists say. If the water is processed so that the only radioactive materials that remain are low levels of tritium, said Kazuya Idemitsu, a professor of nuclear engineering at Kyushu University, releasing it into the ocean would be “the best solution in terms of cost and safety.” Mr. Idemitsu added that functioning nuclear plants around the world release diluted water containing tritium into the ocean. Some scientists said they would need proof before believing that the Fukushima water was treated to safe levels. “I want to see the numbers after they’ve removed these additional radionuclides,” said Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist in marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “Then, and only then, can I make a judgment on the quality of the rationale for releasing it or the consequences of releasing it.” Government officials argue that the water is not so much a scientific problem as a perceptual one. “If the water is discharged into the ocean, the price of seafood products may drop, or consumers won’t want to buy them at all,” said Shuji Okuda, director for decommissioning and contaminated water management at the economy and trade ministry. “So even though there is no scientific evidence that the water is dangerous, we are worried about the effects.” More than 20 countries still have import restrictions on Japanese seafood and other agricultural products that were imposed after the 2011 disaster. Earlier this year, the European Union lifted its ban on some products. In Fukushima, the fishing industry brings only about 15 percent of its pre-disaster catch levels to market. Every haul is sampled and screened in labs run by Fukushima’s prefectural government and the fisheries cooperative.  According to the co-op, the central government currently prohibits the sale of only one species, a rare type of skate. Tadaaki Sawada, the co-op’s division chief, said that if the water was discharged, buyers would be unlikely to believe government safety assurances. “Most people can live without fully understanding the details of radioactivity,” Mr. Sawada said. “They can just say ‘because I don’t understand fully, I won’t buy Fukushima fish.’” In the prefecture, where thousands of residents never returned after evacuating, those who have come back harbor lingering doubts. “In the corner of my mind, I wonder if it is safe or not,” Keiko Nagayama, 65, said as she browsed at a seafood freezer in Naraha, a hamlet in the original 12-mile exclusion zone around the Fukushima plant.  A government evacuation order was lifted in 2015. Although flounder and Pacific saury from Iwaki were on sale, Ms. Nagayama chose flounder from Hokkaido, in far northern Japan. Yukiei Matsumoto, Naraha’s mayor, declined to offer an opinion on the idea of water disposal from the nuclear plant. “Nuclear policy is central government policy,” Mr. Matsumoto said. “The contaminated water is their business.” Naraha is one of several Fukushima towns where the central government has spent heavily to draw people back to their communities. Just 3,877 people — a little over half of the original population — have returned. Tokyo has devoted large sums to subsidize a new school, a strip mall and a new arena that cost 4 billion yen, or about $37 million. On a recent afternoon, a smattering of people worked out in the gym, while just one man used the 25-meter swimming pool in the arena complex.  Yukari Nakamura, 33, a local artist, had been hired to paint murals on the walls and windows. Her husband, Yuuki, and two young children were the only family in a spacious playroom. Ms. Nakamura said a Fukushima label on fish gave her pause. “My heart aches to reject the seafood, and I feel such pain not being able to recommend it,” she said, tearing up. “I don’t want to hurt the fishermen who caught it, but it is so complicated.”']","The water from the Fukushima disaster is more radioactive than the authorities have previously publicized, raising doubts about government assurances that it will be made safe."
"General Who Was Algeria’s De Facto Ruler Dies, Leaving a Power Vacuum",2019-12-23,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Algeria’s de facto ruler, Gen. Ahmed Gaïd Salah, who this year managed the ouster of one president and the ascent of another amid deep civil unrest, died on Monday, according to the state news agency and Algerian press reports. General Gaïd Salah’s unexpected death at 79 — his official age, though he was most likely older — less than two weeks after the army’s favored candidate was elected president, creates a power vacuum in the vast North African nation, a major oil and gas producer. A survivor from the generation that led Algeria to independence from France in the early 1960s, General Gaïd Salah was the man who increasingly blocked the demands of the popular protest movement that has rocked the country’s politics since last February.  As chief of staff, General Gaïd Salah orchestrated a hardening crackdown on the movement, imposed a presidential election that the protesters rejected, and demanded, in regular if stiff televised speeches to other army officers, that the demonstrators back off. The movement has rejected the newly elected president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, as a mere figurehead, put in place to carry out the general’s wishes.  Algerian news media said that General Gaïd Salah died of a heart attack Monday morning in an Algiers military hospital. Earlier this year, he appeared to be bidding for the protest movement’s allegiance, forcing out in April the longtime president he had steadfastly backed, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, by having him declared unfit for office. He was also behind the arrests of numerous businessmen associated with Mr. Bouteflika, as well as several of his prime ministers, and Saïd Bouteflika, the former president’s powerful brother. “Gaïd Salah was essentially known because of Bouteflika,” said Benjamin Stora, a leading historian of Algeria. “He owed his career to Bouteflika. He supported him until the end, and he was the last to say he had to go.” But the protest movement, known as the Hirak, demanded more: the departure of General Gaïd Salah himself, and everyone associated with the military-political elite, which Algerians call the System, that has ruled the country since independence in 1962. This the general refused. It is unclear how much of a free hand Mr. Tebboune, the new president, will have in running the country, with the military leaders in General Gaïd Salah’s circle still in the background. The “red line” the president cannot cross, according to Mr. Stora, is “the army’s role in the economy,” including the generous funding it receives, making it the top arms buyer in Africa. General Gaïd Salah began his military career as a teenager in the national liberation army fighting the French. He later trained at a Soviet military academy and rose through the ranks of the Algerian army, becoming head of ground forces in Algeria’s bloody 1990s civil war with the Islamists. He had formed a strong alliance with Mr. Bouteflika in the early 2000s, ever since the Algerian president saved him from a forced early retirement. As Mr. Bouteflika’s vice-minister of defense, he helped his benefactor dismantle the country’s powerful internal security services. For years, General Gaïd Salah dutifully stood in the shadows, ready to back Mr. Bouteflika but never stealing the limelight. And the government showered cash on him and his army from the country’s oil earnings. “The death of General Gaïd Salah is a harsh blow to the System, which will be somewhat destabilized,” Nacer Djabi, a leading sociologist, said Monday in Algiers. “Obviously, his personality counted for a great deal in the way the situation was unfolding.” “This was a man who had been able to break with the Bouteflika system, relying at first on the Hirak, and who also did a lot in the fight against corruption,” Mr. Djabi said. “For Algerians, he did some things that were scarcely believable, including the arrest of a number of important figures, but we’re just going to have to wait to see what the real impact will be.” “But this death signals the disappearance of a whole political and military generation,” he added. Others were more measured. “Since there is now an elected president, I don’t think the general’s death will have a huge impact on the way the situation unfolds,” said Mohamed Hennad, a political scientist in Algiers. “And I don’t think the executive’s strategy will change that much.” Still, it was the general’s name that the crowds shouted, with anger and derision, for months in Algiers, insisting that he leave the country’s governance to civilians. Whether that will now happen is an open question. Hadjer Guenanfa contributed reporting from Algiers.']","Gen.

Santa Hats and Tear Gas: Hong Kong Protests Flare Again,2019-12-24,"By Austin Ramzy, Ezra Cheung and Lam Yik Fei","['HONG KONG —\xa0Christmas Eve, ordinarily a night of revelry in Hong Kong, was filled with tear gas and pepper spray as riot police officers clashed with pro-democracy protesters who gathered at malls and shopping districts.  Two dozen people were injured, including one protester who fell over a railing and at least one floor in a shopping mall while trying to evade arrest, and another who fell from the roof of a restaurant that was being raided by the police. The police said the man at the mall was being treated for injuries at a hospital and had been arrested on charges of assaulting an officer. Officials did not comment on the other man’s status, but witnesses said he was conscious at the time of his fall. The protests, which began in June over a since-withdrawn proposal that would allow extraditions to mainland China, have entered a period of relative calm. But occasional flare-ups continue.  On Tuesday, thousands of protesters flooded the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district and clashed with the police, who fired pepper spray and tear gas. The police said some protesters had built barricades, vandalized stores and set fire to the entrance of a subway station. One clash took place outside one of Hong Kong’s most expensive hotels, the Peninsula. For six months, protesters have staged regular demonstrations, sometimes violent, over concerns that China’s central government is increasing its control over the semiautonomous territory. They have called for expanded elections, amnesty for arrested demonstrators and an investigation into the police’s use of force. “I have especially come out to stand with our young protesters,” said Alan Ming, 61, a retired factory owner. “I have never felt more upset on a Christmas Eve. I feel heavy-hearted.” In the Mong Kok neighborhood, a man was assaulted after getting into a dispute with protesters. Christmas Eve in Hong Kong is usually a good night for businesses, but many of the people who crowded through shopping districts were not there to shop. Protesters vandalized a bank in the Mong Kok district. Riot police officers dispersed crowds, clashing with protesters. Flash mobs turned up at numerous malls. Volunteer medics treated a protester in Tsim Sha Tsui who was injured in a clash. Protesters set a fire in the middle of a street in Mong Kok. The scene on the waterfront in Tsim Sha Tsui.

Nigeria Releases Leading Critic on Bail After a Campaign an Ocean Away,2019-12-25,By Ruth Maclean,"['A Nigerian publisher and former presidential candidate was released on bail on Tuesday after a monthslong imprisonment that heightened fears of deteriorating protections for free expression in Africa’s most populous nation. Omoyele Sowore, the founder of the website Sahara Reporters, had been held for most of the past five months by Nigeria’s equivalent of the Secret Service, the Department for State Services. Two earlier court orders to release Mr. Sowore on bail had been ignored by the authorities. At a court appearance on Dec. 6, Mr. Sowore, then temporarily free, was wrestled to the floor of a courtroom and taken into custody, an incident that stirred outrage when it was circulated on social media.  Mr. Sowore still faces trial on charges of treason, money laundering and “cyberstalking” — the last for allegedly insulting the president, Muhammadu Buhari, on television. His bail conditions stipulate that he may not leave the Nigerian capital, Abuja, or speak to the press, but that did not stop him from giving a short statement after his release. Six members of the United States Congress had appealed to the Nigerian attorney general on behalf of Mr. Sowore, who lives in New Jersey with his wife and children but whose work focuses on exposing corruption and government malfeasance in Nigeria. His wife, Opeyemi Sowore, said that she was grateful for his release, but that her family was still praying for the “holiday miracle” of his return home to Haworth, N.J., where the family’s neighbors have campaigned for the Nigerian authorities to free him. “My No. 1 concern is for his safety,” Ms. Sowore said. “We remain resolute on Yele being cleared of all baseless charges,” she added, using the short form of Omoyele Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey said that he was gratified to hear of Mr. Sowore’s release, but that he and Representative Josh Gottheimer, also of New Jersey, would watch Mr. Sowore’s case closely. “I expect the government of Nigeria to ensure his continued safety and security now that he is out of custody,” Senator Menendez said.  Mr. Gottheimer added: “We will not stop working until Yele comes home.”  Mr. Sowore was once seen as supportive of Mr. Buhari, but he came to be one of the administration’s fiercest critics. In February, Mr. Buhari was elected to a second term in an election in which Mr. Sowore ran unsuccessfully against him. Mr. Sowore was arrested on Aug. 3, on one of his frequent trips to his native country, when he was about to lead a protest against the government with the social media tagline #RevolutionNow. His critics accuse him of trying to overthrow the Nigerian government rather than, as his supporters claim, merely pointing out government corruption and wrongdoing.']","Omoyele Sowore, a publisher and ex-presidential candidate, was released after months in detention.

Climate Change Strikes at the Heart of German Identity: The Woods,2019-12-24,By Melissa Eddy,"['SCHIERKE, Germany — Several retirees, a few millennials, a local couple and a technology specialist who saved overtime hours to take a day off from work gathered around a pile of birch twigs sprouting leaves on one end and a tangle of fine roots at the other.  One by one, they grabbed a bundle of the seedlings and picked their way through snow-clad fallen branches, searching for holes that had been dug into the black earth on the edge of the Harz National Park in the heart of Germany.  “You want to cover them well, and don’t leave any air pockets beneath the roots,” cautioned Olaf Eggert, the ranger responsible for this stretch of woods, as he held a seedling aloft, his forefingers scissored about halfway up the stem to demonstrate how deep in the earth the young trees must be buried to ensure their survival until spring. More than 444,000 acres of forest in Germany are distressed or have died in recent years, according to government data. Across the country, Germans are worried about the survival of their forests, a natural treasure that is considered part of their identity and a source of their wealth.  So people are heading into the woods to do what they can do to help save them. Rangers in the Harz National Park said they had repeatedly sought volunteers to help plant new trees since the park was established in 1990. But this year they barely needed to advertise.  “We have a lot of inquiries from people who have a need to do something to help the forest,” said Mr. Eggert, the ranger. Jörg Berthold, one of the volunteers, moved farther up the hill from the dozen others taking part in the day’s reforestation effort. “In times like this, you have to help it out,” said Mr. Berthold, who said he had responded to an ad posted on the national park’s website for help rejuvenating the forest. “It’s become the big popular public sport around here — planting trees.” In the last weeks of the autumn planting season, school classes, employees from a nearby Volkswagen plant and members of sports clubs showed up, at times outnumbering the number of seedlings available. A woman who gave her name only as Jezz, an entrepreneur from the nearby town of Wernigerode, said she was helping the local woods instead of traveling around the world this year. “We are planting trees instead of flying on planes,” she said.  In the 1980s, fears that German forests were dying from acid rain — when the word “Waldsterben,” or “forest death,” was coined — led to widespread protests and galvanized the popularity of the nascent Greens party. Although laws to curb toxic emissions eventually led to a decrease in pollutants and a revival of the woods, that period left its mark on the trees that survived. More recently, rising temperatures caused by climate change are threatening German forests. Severe drought in 2018 followed by another exceptionally dry summer this year left trees across Germany vulnerable to bark beetles that lay their eggs just beneath the bark, which has killed trees and left large swaths of normally lush, green hillsides a sickly brown. Adding to the stress is a lack of diversity in the species of trees in German forests, where primeval woods were cleared hundreds of years ago and replaced with faster-growing pines that have proved less resilient to rising temperatures. Some forest rangers are trying to change that by allowing previously cultivated woodlands to return to their natural state. “Most German forests are under extreme conditions and therefore likely experience stress,” said Allan Buras, who monitors forest health as a member of the Bavarian Climate Research Network. “This is also what we are seeing on the ground. We are finding increased mortality rates among the trees. It is pretty alarming.”  The woods hold a special place in the German psyche and national identity, reaching back to the Germanic tribes who worshiped the basswoods and oaks covering the central European lands they ruled. The German Romantics of the 19th century revived the image of the forest as mythical place, one that could pose a danger as in “Little Red Riding Hood” or offer protection as in “Snow White.”  Later, industrialization and the need for timber led Germans to view their forests as a source of wealth that could be managed and harvested on a mass scale. In response, conservationism was born, with the introduction of reforestation efforts and the imposition of harsh prison sentences and even the death penalty for anyone caught setting forest fires.  Germans are credited with starting the tradition of Christmas trees in the 16th century, and to this day many cities select the finest firs from local parks and forests to cut down and decorate for the holiday. But in Wernigerode this year, residents rallied around a 49-foot-tall fir tree that had been slated to be felled for this year’s Christmas market in the medieval town center. They argued that it made no sense to sacrifice a healthy tree for the holidays, and the city authorities instead found a smaller tree to use. Rangers estimate that 80,000 tree shoots have been placed in the ground around Schierke this year. Deeper into the park, nature is being left to repair itself after centuries in which Germans cultivated and harvested forests for timber. The decision to entrust nature to heal itself has resulted in large swaths of bare, lifeless tree trunks in areas once thick with lush, deep green pines. This has pitted preservationists against foresters who worry that failing to clear the dead trees will cause insect infestations to spread more rapidly. At the same time, scientists are working to figure out which tree varieties will be more resistant to the rising temperatures that have stressed even native beeches. German foresters believe that their country could play a key role in determining how to transform woodlands to withstand climate change. Reforestation efforts are among the initiatives in a nearly $889 million package approved by the German government this year to help save the forests. Lobbying groups say the investment is desperately needed, and private foresters agree. Cornelius Meyer-Stork is among the many private foresters who own nearly half of all woodland in Germany. He welcomed the government’s support, pointing out that farmers in the European Union receive about $288 in subsidies for every 2.5 acres they work and are eligible for more if they meet certain requirements. By contrast, he said, “we foresters receive nothing.”  In previous years, he opened his forest to allow people to cut down young pines as Christmas trees if they were crowding others. He also groomed the paths to set up basic infrastructure and earn certification for his land as a sustainable forest for rest and relaxation.  But after bark beetles ravaged a hillside once covered with pines, Mr. Meyer-Stork was forced to raze the land and sell the damaged wood to make paper or particle board for half of the usual price. Now, a picnic table he built in a shady grove stands amid a tangle of stumps and branches.  “It used to be surrounded by tall pines,” he said. “Now I guess I’ll have to move it.”']","Forests are a source of inspiration, respite and wealth in Germany. Now, people are fighting to save them from drought and illness. "
‘We’d Prefer the Food’: Zimbabwe Fears a Famine Is in Its Future,2019-12-25,By Jeffrey Moyo and Rick Gladstone,"['HARARE, Zimbabwe — The people lined up early for a chance to buy subsidized maize meal from the government-run Grain Marketing Board depot in Harare, at prices they could afford. After three hours, a guard emerged to announce that the depot’s supply was rotten so there would be none for sale that day. The crowd of 150 reacted with disbelief and anger.  “Life is hard, all things are expensive, there are no price controls and inflation just keeps getting worse,” said Benjamini Dunha, 57, a plumber who makes 700 Zimbabwe dollars a month — about $38 at official exchange rates. Less than a year ago, his salary was worth much closer to $700.  Another shopper, Nyasha Domboka, 52, spoke cynically about a truckful of maize meal, also known as mealie meal, that he had just seen in the depot parking lot. “How can mealie-meal packed just recently be said to have gone bad all of a sudden?” he asked. A combination of government dysfunction, an economic meltdown, droughts and a calamitous cyclone this past March have hurtled Zimbabwe toward a hunger disaster that has become the most severe in southern Africa and among the most alarming in the world. While food is not necessarily scarce yet, it is becoming unaffordable for all but the privileged few.  “I cannot stress enough the urgency of the situation in Zimbabwe,” Hilal Elver, an independent United Nations human rights expert on food security, said after a 10-day visit in November. Sixty percent of the country’s 14 million people, Ms. Elver said, are “food-insecure, living in a household that is unable to obtain enough food to meet basic needs.” Hunger in Africa is a pervasive problem, but in Zimbabwe, once known as the continent’s breadbasket, it has been compounded by dysfunction that has left the country in its most serious economic crisis in a decade. The annual inflation rate, which the International Monetary Fund has called the world’s highest, is 300 percent.  Maize meal, a staple of the Zimbabwean diet, doubled in price in November to 101 Zimbabwe dollars per 10-kilogram sack. Now it costs 117. In early December, a two-liter bottle of cooking oil cost 59 Zimbabwe dollars. Now it costs more than 72. “The money here is valueless now,” said Mr. Dunha, who has eight children. All they can afford to eat, he said, are vegetables and sadza, a thick porridge of boiled maize meal. Gerald Bourke, a spokesman for the southern Africa operations of the World Food Program, the anti-hunger agency of the United Nations, said that until recently 60 percent of its assistance to Zimbabweans was in the form of cash, but that the recipients no longer wanted the money.  “Inflation is a rampant problem and people said, ‘We’d prefer the food,’” Mr. Bourke said. So by January, he said, the agency intends to switch to a “fully in-kind food program” for the first time in Zimbabwe, distributing monthly rations of grain, oil and nutritional supplements for children younger than 5. The agency also will double the number of recipients to four million. “This is certainly the worst we are seeing in southern Africa,” Mr. Bourke said during a mid-December field visit to Harare, the capital. While cases of acute hunger have not been uncommon in rural Zimbabwe, “it’s seen in the cities now,” he said. “Hungry people in the countryside are moving to the cities” in search of food.  The finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, said on Friday that the government would spend 180 million Zimbabwe dollars a month on subsidies as part of an effort to keep the price of maize meal stable.  But for many Zimbabweans, there is fear that the inflation problem portends a return to the days more than a decade ago when a trip to buy groceries required wheelbarrows of cash. Even now, purchases of anything beyond maize meal is considered a luxury.  “We used to buy favorite foods such as ice cream, cheese, bacon, sausages and ham, and prepare good breakfasts for our families, “ said Moreblessing Nyambara, a 35-year-old Harare schoolteacher. “These things are a vision of the past now.” Many historians attribute Zimbabwe’s predicament to the legacy of Robert Mugabe, the father of independence in 1980. An icon of African anti-colonialism, Mr. Mugabe became a despot and presided over the decline of what had been one of Africa’s most prosperous lands. He was ousted in 2017, and died in September at age 95. Any hopes that Mr. Mugabe’s former ally and successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, could revive Zimbabwe’s economy have almost completely faded.  This past June Mr. Mnangagwa scrapped a policy known as dollarization, in which the United States dollar and other foreign currencies were used as legal tender. That policy was introduced in 2009 and helped end an era of hyperinflation, which had rendered the Zimbabwe dollar less valuable than the paper it was printed on. But a newly introduced version of the Zimbabwe dollar has plunged in value, drastically raising the prices of goods priced in the currency.  Foreigners are reluctant to invest in Zimbabwe despite Mr. Mnangagwa’s proclamation that the country is “open for business.” Export sales and remittances from the Zimbabwean diaspora, important sources of United States dollars needed to import food and fuel, have fallen.  Mr. Mnangagwa has rejected calls to restore dollarization.  “No progressive nation can progress without its own currency,” he told members of the governing ZANU-PF party at their annual conference in mid-December. “We will not revert back.”  Still, for now, the inflation problem remains less severe than what prevailed more than a decade ago.  At that time, prices were doubling every day, reaching a point where a single sheet of two-ply toilet paper cost nearly as much as a 500-Zimbabwe-dollar bill, then the smallest in circulation. That comparison spawned grim jokes about a better use for the currency.  Four million Zimbabweans are now not that far away from famine, according to a scale commonly used internationally to classify the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition. In the scale’s five phases, Phase 1 is minimal and Phase 5 is famine. Mr. Bourke, the program spokesman, said the hungriest Zimbabweans were now in either Phase 3 or Phase 4. With Zimbabwe’s last maize harvest down by half compared with the year before because of drought, he said, the aid will continue until at least through the end of April, when the next harvest is due. But he was not optimistic. “The weather forecasters are basically saying we’re looking at a very dry growing season,” Mr. Bourke said. Ursula Mueller, the deputy emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations, who visited Zimbabwe in June, said the country’s travails were partly tied to a broader climate crisis in southern Africa that has rippled through all facets of life. Drought begets less food, which in turn begets declines in health and education and increases in crime and other “negative coping mechanisms,” she said.  “This is not just a food crisis. It is a wider more complicated situation,” she said in a telephone interview on Friday. “People have to make choices: Do I seek H.I.V. treatment or food?” Ms. Mueller also said a United Nations humanitarian budget for Zimbabwe had received only half the nearly $468 million requested, forcing her office to dip into other emergency funding. Humanitarian aid by the United Nations is financed almost entirely by voluntary contributions. Beyond immediate assistance, Ms. Mueller said that more investments were needed to address the root causes of problems in Zimbabwe and other countries that have the potential for more self-sufficiency.  “We need to move out of this cycle of dependency,” she said. Otherwise, “humanitarians find themselves in protracted situations for years.” Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Rick Gladstone from New York.']","Government dysfunction, an economic meltdown, drought and a calamitous flood have plunged Zimbabwe into a hunger crisis.

"As Protests Flare in India, Modi Plays a New Position: Defense",2019-12-24,"By Jeffrey Gettleman, Hari Kumar and Saumya Khandelwal","['VARANASI, India — Nidhi Tiwari is an upper-caste Hindu. She voted for India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, in the last election. She lives in Mr. Modi’s constituency, Varanasi, a holy Hindu city. She was, up until last week, one of the millions of bricks in his base.  But Ms. Tiwari, a university student, has turned against Mr. Modi, joining the growing protests sweeping this country after he pushed through a contentious citizenship law that more and more Indians see as anti-Muslim and a blow to India’s foundation of tolerance and secularism.  “I used to see Modi as a strong leader, as the person India had been waiting so long to get,” Ms. Tiwari said. “Now, I see him as a monster.” Until this outpouring of anger, Mr. Modi seemed unstoppable. Riding a populist wave, he was pushing ahead with plans to bring India closer to becoming a Hindu homeland, a divisive dream harbored by his political party whose roots lie deep in a Hindu-centric worldview that poses an existential threat to India’s large Muslim minority.  Now some of his support is beginning to crack, even in strongholds like Varanasi. For the first time, Indians are standing up to Mr. Modi in a widespread and forceful way. How this plays out in the next few weeks could have a seismic impact on India.  The protests are jumping from city to city. They are drawing in an increasingly broad cohort of Indian society, including former Modi fans and many non-Muslims.  If they succeed in slowing him down or changing his course, it could be a lasting victory for the secular version of India that the founders envisioned as a multicultural nation encompassing a dizzying diversity of languages, religions and geographic identities. If the protests fizzle, Mr. Modi’s vision of a Hindu nation could draw closer.  “This is undeniably the biggest pushback Modi has faced from civil society since coming to power in 2014,” said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  Varanasi, a city of temples along the banks of the Ganges River that Mr. Modi repeatedly returns to for spiritual strength — and for votes — reflects his challenge. He still has a lot of support, but parts of the city have erupted beneath him.  Muslims, students, left-leaning professionals, and lower- and upper-caste Hindus have poured into the narrow, brick-walled lanes yelling, “Down with Modi!”  The police have responded by beating people up, kicking in doors, shutting down the internet, arresting scores, and in one incident charging into a crowd and setting off a stampede that crushed a 9-year-old boy who was out riding his red bicycle.  As the protests have swelled across the country, hundreds of thousands have joined. Thousands have been arrested and more than 20 killed.  The demonstrations are still mostly confined to the new citizenship law that fast-tracks Indian citizenship for migrants from neighboring countries who are Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Sikh, Parsee or Jain — all of South Asia’s major religions bar one: Islam. But the broader context is an India whose star is not quite as shiny as it was a few years ago. Grumbles are growing about the weakening economy, which the protests are not helping. Mr. Modi had promised to create millions of new jobs; he has not. Across northern India’s industrial heartland, people are feeling the pinch.  Varanasi may be a sacred city, where countless bodies are cremated along the banks of the Ganges, but it is also a modern city where countless saris are made in factories. “I’m hearing it all over town: People are fed up with this regime,” said Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, an electronics engineering professor and the head of an important temple. “Why did he push this? Was this really the need of the time?’’  Even at this divisive and turbulent moment, much of India is solidly behind Mr. Modi. He has deeper and broader support than any Indian figure has generated in decades, which has enabled him to pursue an agenda that alienates minorities and frightens progressives.  His government and its allies have been changing place names to Hindu from Muslim, rubbing out historic Muslim figures from textbooks and celebrating lynch mobs who murdered Muslims.  After Mr. Modi’s overwhelming re-election in May, the Hindu nationalist campaign reached a fever pitch. His government stripped statehood from Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, and then passed the new citizenship law. Mr. Modi’s popularity cannot be chalked up only to the fact that Hindu nationalist ideology plays well in a country that is 80 percent Hindu. The Modi administration has also done a better job than previous governments in pushing big anti-poverty initiatives, such as building 100 million toilets to help stop open defecation and the spread of deadly disease.  His Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies control nearly two-thirds of the lower house of Parliament. These past weeks, opposition politicians have shown once again how fractured they are, by not capitalizing on the protests.  There has been nothing close to a coordinated strategy, and as students and intellectuals are dragged away by riot police officers, many opposition leaders have been cheering on the protesters — from Twitter.  Politically, analysts say, Mr. Modi is safe. But these protests pose a threat to his ideological agenda. “Modi is not a normal politician who measures his success only by votes,” said Kanchan Chandra, a political scientist at New York University. “He sees himself as the architect of a new India, built on a foundation of technological, cultural, economic and military prowess, and backed by an ideology of Hindu nationalism.”  The effects are already being felt. Mr. Modi’s party lost state elections in Jharkhand this week. And he and party leaders have shelved plans to plow ahead with a national citizenship review.  The process could have forced all Indians to produce documentary proof that they were citizens, a difficult task in a developing country where countless people do not have such records. The widespread suspicion was that the administration was pushing this review, in combination with the citizenship law, to disenfranchise Muslims, though Mr. Modi has vehemently denied that.  It has been a long time since Mr. Modi, 69, has had to play defense. He began his career from humble roots — first wandering solo through the Himalayas as a young preacher, then becoming a ground-level party operative, then chief minister, then prime minister.  He knows, intimately, the perils of Hindu-Muslim tensions. In 2002, when he was chief minister of Gujarat State, he was accused of allowing more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, to be slaughtered in communal violence. He was never charged, though suspicions remained. Mr. Modi radiates intensity, but lately he seems a little less self-assured.  At a huge outdoor rally on Sunday afternoon, in the winter chill and in front of a crowd roaring, “Modi Modi Modi!” he looked tight, distracted, distant, even a bit angry.  He lashed out at what he called a “conspiracy” by opposition politicians and expressed little sorrow, or even acknowledgment, for those killed. He gave the impression that he thrived on the controversy, thundering, “The more they hate me, the more the love of this country’s public rains on me.”  At the same time, Mr. Modi has been trying to act as if, somehow, everything is normal. He went to a meeting on the Ganges River one day and spoke at an investment conference on another. Within his administration he has expressed confidence that the storm will soon pass. He believes that the discontent is simply naysayers upset about how fast he is moving with policies that previous Indian politicians struggled to carry out. Though protests have erupted in virtually every Indian state, the violence has been the most intense — and the most people have been killed — in the states controlled by Mr. Modi’s political party, such as Uttar Pradesh.  Witnesses say that police forces under the command of Yogi Adityanath, the state’s chief minister, a Hindu monk and a Modi acolyte, have systematically swept through Muslim neighborhoods, breaking into houses, hauling off Muslim men and destroying Muslim families’ property.  Mr. Adityanath’s police have also been widely accused of firing live ammunition into crowds. In Varanasi, which is in Uttar Pradesh, the Muslim quarter feels under occupation. Life goes on — children fly kites from rooftops, people fry balls of dough in piping hot skillets, half of the markets are open — but it all happens under a thick tension coiled with violence.  Police officers in riot gear and helmets prowl the lanes, some carrying submachine guns. The residents glare at them. “What would I tell Mr. Modi?"" said Vakil Ahmed, whose son was the one trampled last week. “I’d ask: ‘Why are you doing these atrocities to us?’” The crowds at the protests usually run in the thousands, and for them to expand they would have to draw in other groups. The Dalits and members of other lower castes, for example, have been complaining for years about discrimination under Mr. Modi.  Many protesters have been young progressives like Ms. Tiwari, a 20-year-old political science student whose family are longtime Modi supporters. She believes Mr. Modi’s recent moves are threatening India’s “soul.”  “Every day I argue with my dad,” she said. And even though her father will not give her logical arguments, she says, he still supports Mr. Modi.

"Pope Francis, in Christmas Speech, Urges Nations to Tend to Refugees",2019-12-25,By Anna Momigliano and Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — As Christians around the world celebrated Christmas, Pope Francis called on Wednesday for a softening of “stony and self-centered hearts,” once again directing the world’s attention to the plight of migrants and people living in areas plagued by conflict, social and political upheaval, injustice, or natural disasters. Addressing thousands of people gathered in St. Peter’s Square, the pope spoke of the millions of people who have fled their homes for “places where they might have hope for a dignified life,” only to find themselves “before walls of indifference.” Making his annual Christmas speech, Francis lamented the miseries of several trouble spots, urging the rest of the world to take responsibility for healing those places and to embrace the refugees who leave them. It has been one of the most powerful and consistent messages of his papacy, at a time when many nations have shown little interest in resolving foreign conflicts or taking in migrants and have often blamed newcomers for economic and social ills. Delivering his “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and to the World”) benediction from a balcony in the facade of St. Peter’s Basilica, the pope asked Jesus to “bless the efforts of those who spare no effort to promote justice and reconciliation and to overcome the various crises and the many forms of poverty that offend the dignity of each person.” Speaking of “the many children suffering from war and conflicts in the Middle East” and a Holy Land that still awaits “a time of peace, security and prosperity,” he urged “governments and the international community to find solutions to allow the peoples of that region to live together in peace and security, and put an end to their sufferings.” In the Americas, “where a number of nations are experiencing a time of social and political upheaval,” Francis called for comfort for “the beloved Venezuelan people, long tried by their political and social tensions.” Francis also called for “concrete solutions for an enduring peace” in Ukraine, and cited all those in Africa “who are persecuted for their religious faith, especially missionaries and members of the faithful who have been kidnapped,” as well as “victims of attacks by extremist groups, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Nigeria.” It is such suffering, he said, that has pushed millions of people to leave their homelands to find better lives. “It is injustice that makes them cross deserts and seas that become cemeteries,” he said, and “injustice that forces them to endure unspeakable forms of abuse, enslavement of every kind and torture in inhumane detention camps.” Francis spoke after military marching bands had played the Vatican and the Italian national hymns. “Brothers and sisters, Merry Christmas,” he began, to cheers. Warm applause greeted his address, and the pope then blessed the thousands in the square, and the thousands more who packed the broad avenue that leads to the basilica. “Hurray for the pope,” rose a cheer from the square. All people are called on “to give hope to the world,” Francis said, before wishing everyone “a good Christmas lunch.” Earlier Wednesday, Francis was one of three religious leaders who appealed directly to the leaders of South Sudan to end the violence there and form a transitional power-sharing government. Peace talks between the government and rebels stalled this week. The brief message — signed by Francis; Archbishop Justin Welby, the leader of the Anglican Church; and the Rev. John Chalmers, the former moderator of the Church of Scotland — said the leaders were praying for “a renewed commitment to the path of reconciliation and fraternity.” Peace in the mostly Christian country, the leaders said, would “bring to fulfillment our desire to visit your beloved country.” At a Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter’s, Francis spoke of God’s unconditional love. “Christmas reminds us that God continues to love us all, even the worst of us,” Francis said in his homily. Whether he had in mind priests who have sexually abused children was not clear, but his message might not be welcomed by victims and other critics who say the church has been far too forgiving of those priests and the prelates who have protected them.  “God does not love you because you think and act the right way. He loves you, plain and simple,” Francis said. “You may have mistaken ideas, you may have made a complete mess of things, but the Lord continues to love you.” Over the past year, Francis has strengthened the church’s stance in fighting the scourge of sexual abuse, convening a meeting in February of bishops from around the world to address the issue. In May, the Vatican mandated that those suspected of abuse be reported to their superiors. This month, it removed the high level of secrecy applied to such cases, which was often cited as a reason not to cooperate with the secular authorities, and which critics said had helped conceal the problem and let it fester in the church. Anna Momigliano reported from Rome, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Verbania, Italy.']","In his traditional holiday benediction, Francis renewed his call to resolve conflicts and to help those who have fled them.

"As a Spanish City Lights Up for Christmas, So Does a Debate",2019-12-24,By Raphael Minder,"['VIGO, Spain — Before the holiday season, the mayor of this Spanish city bragged that his Christmas lights would outshine New York, which lies across the Atlantic on the same latitude. Holding up his cellphone at a news conference, Vigo’s mayor, Abel Caballero, jokingly predicted that he would soon get a call from his counterpart, Bill de Blasio, telling him that New Yorkers were feeling jealous because they could see that “the lights of Vigo are the best on the planet.”  New York’s mayor did not ring him. But tens of thousands of visitors have since responded to Mr. Caballero’s invitation, generating a Christmas tourism boom that has been a welcome change for Vigo. The city’s claim to fame in other seasons is as an industrial hub and Spain’s largest fishing port. Mr. Caballero, 73, is an exuberant Socialist politician who also likes to call himself “the most popular mayor in Europe.” Still, some have wondered whether the mayor’s almost unparalleled enthusiasm for Christmas lights has gone over the top, giving him a certain notoriety in Spain.  The mayor spent 1 million euros, or about $1.1 million, decorating Vigo with 10 million Christmas lights this year, at a time when environmentalists want mayors like Mr. Caballero to reduce light pollution and the energy consumption required to fuel it. “It seems an absurd contradiction that Spain held a climate change summit  just as Vigo competed with other Spanish cities for who could switch on the most Christmas lights,” said Serafín González Prieto, the president of the Galician Society of Natural History, a regional nongovernmental organization. It enraged environmentalists all the more that Mr. Caballero even spoke about Vigo as an urban environmental example at the United Nations conference in Madrid.  Vigo switched on its Christmas lights on Nov. 23, ahead of the long holiday weekend to celebrate Spain’s Constitution, during which Vigo’s hotels reported full occupancy. Two decades ago, hotels had an occupancy rate of 20 percent on the same Constitution holiday. “People see that I have been transforming Vigo, and not just because I have made sure that we are celebrating Christmas as the big feast that it should always be,” Mr. Caballero said in an interview.  In a coastal city used to powerful Atlantic storms but not snow, the mayor has also deployed a dozen snow-making machines to spray flakes for two minutes every hour. On Sunday, children collected flakes as if they were drops of rain falling on a desert. “We have a Christmas that is bringing joy and has put Vigo on the map, what more could you ask for?” said José Ramón Amado Gabeiras, a welder, as he waved at his 4-year-old daughter each time she passed by on a children’s train ride. Christmas lights aside, Mr. Caballero is known for his publicity stunts, as well as for peppering his speeches with heavily accented English. To connect with Vigo’s youth, the mayor has not hesitated to show off his floss dancing skills in front of hundreds of schoolchildren, or risk falling off his bike while inaugurating a BMX competition.  Mr. Caballero served as Spain’s transport and tourism minister in the 1980s. In June, he started his fourth mandate as mayor, after a landslide election victory in which he won 67 percent of the votes in a city of just under 300,000 residents.  His longevity stands out at a time of political volatility and fragmentation in Spain’s politics. After its fourth election in four years in November, the country is still without a government, despite a tentative deal. Last month, the candidates of the five largest national parties were all men in their 30s or 40s.  ‘‘Caballero is popular, sure, but he is also a populist who has portrayed himself as the only real defender of Vigo and blamed anything that goes wrong on others,’’ said Ignacio López-Chaves, a former conservative city politician in Vigo. “I personally would prefer more focus on reminding people about the real meaning of Christmas rather than just offering lights and fun.” Carlos Príncipe, a Socialist mayor of Vigo in the 1990s, has more recently been one of the most outspoken detractors of Mr. Caballero, having accused him of ignoring more important issues like a lack of social housing and the decline of the city’s shipbuilding activities.  One of Vigo’s famous shipyards, Barreras, has been fighting against closing because of its debts and problems with a cruise ship contract. “These Christmas lights are like the orchestra playing on the Titanic,’’ Mr. Príncipe said. “You get people to dance while Vigo’s economy is sinking.” But Mr. Caballero insisted that his electoral success showed he was helping sustain and modernize his city, notably by investing in escalators and elevators to help residents move up its hilly streets, while at the same time managing to improve the city’s financial management and erase public debt.  The mayor also staunchly defended his environmental record, saying that the city’s electricity consumption had fallen by about one quarter since he switched street lighting to LED, low-consumption bulbs.  “When I became mayor, Vigo still used some sodium vapor lights,” which consumed far more energy, he said. “The only complaint I have heard this Christmas is from people unhappy that I did not put beautiful lights on their own street.” Indeed, environmental concerns did not seem to be much on the minds of holiday revelers who packed streets on Sunday evening, after three days in which severe winter storms brought havoc to the festivities.  Strong winds even forced the temporary dismantling of the Ferris wheel that is one of the main attractions of Vigo’s Christmas display. “Everything here has been well organized and under control, except the weather,” said Florentina Musa, who was running one of the market food stalls, selling a colorful assortment of dried fruit and nuts coated in chocolate. ‘‘However much people love Christmas, you cannot expect them to stroll across a market during a downpour.” The Christmas market was held for the first time in the Alameda, Vigo’s elegant downtown park. However, few of its wooden stalls sold specific Christmas decorations and gifts.  The food on offer was mostly waffles, crepes and hot dogs, as well as local specialties like boiled octopus, rather than the kind of Christmas confectionery that is the hallmark of famous European Christmas markets like those in Strasbourg, Cologne or Budapest. Still, the bright lights seemed more than enough to make most visitors happy. “I have never seen Vigo look so bright and cheerful,” said Javier Alvarez, a Swiss prison official who returns to Vigo every Christmas to spend time with family relatives. “Christmas is all about making people marvel, so I can’t see a better way of doing it than this.”']",The holiday light show in the industrial hub of Vigo is a draw for tourists. But some have begun to wonder: How much is too much?
"Putin’s Russia, Punching Above Its Weight, Keeps Adversaries Off Balance",2019-12-23,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Its economy, already smaller than Italy’s, may be sputtering but, two decades after a virtually unknown former K.G.B. spy took power in the Kremlin on Dec. 31, 1999, Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, have just had what could be their best year yet. The United States, an implacable foe during the Cold War but now presided over by a president determined to “get along with Russia,” is convulsed and distracted by impeachment; Britain, the other main pillar of a trans-Atlantic alliance that Mr. Putin has worked for years to undermine, is also turning inward and just voted for a government that vows to exit the European Union by the end of January. The Middle East, where American and British influence once reigned supreme, has increasingly tilted toward Moscow as it turned the tide of war in Syria, provided Turkey, a member of NATO, with advanced missile systems, and signed contracts worth billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia, America’s closest ally in the Arab world. Russia has also drawn close to Egypt, another longtime American ally, become a key player in Libya’s civil war, and moved toward what looks more and more like an alliance with China. It has been barely five years since President Barack Obama’s dismissive 2014 judgment of Russia as a “regional power” capable only of threatening its neighbors “not out of strength but out of weakness.” Its successes raise a mystifying question: How has a country like Russia, huge in size — it has 11 time zones — but puny when measured by economic and other important metrics, become such a potent force? “When the Soviet Union collapsed, everyone was asking the same question,” recalled Nina Khrushcheva, granddaughter of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and a Russia expert at the New School in New York: “How is it that such a rotten system punched so far above its weight?” The West, Ms. Khrushcheva said, has repeatedly misread a country whose ambitions are as immense as its territory — it stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea — and that is often untethered from what looks like reality. Mr. Putin, she said, “is at once a technocrat and a religious zealot, an exhibitionist and a master of secrets. You expect one thing, linearly, and suddenly it’s entirely something else, smoke and mirrors.” Under Mr. Putin, Vladislav Surkov, a longtime Kremlin adviser, wrote in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a Moscow newspaper, earlier this year, Russia “is playing with the West’s minds.” Also its own. As a reporter based in Moscow two decades ago when Russia’s first democratically elected president, Boris N. Yeltsin, handed power to Mr. Putin, I traveled to St. Petersburg, the new president’s hometown, to try to figure out what chance — if any — Mr. Putin had of ruling, never mind reversing, the bleak scene he had been handed. Russia was a mess, its economy still blighted by a post-Soviet collapse worse than the Great Depression in the United States, its military so feeble that it had lost a war in tiny Chechnya, its population so disillusioned with Mr. Yeltsin’s promises of a new capitalist dawn that it had elected a parliament filled with communists, cranks and crypto-fascists. A conversation with Mr. Putin’s former high-school biology teacher, however, quickly made clear that, as a popular Russian saying goes, “hope dies last.” She remembered Mr. Putin as not only a diligent student but also an exceptional basketball player because “he was very tall.” That the diminutive new president had grown in her memory to become a giant gave me my first glimpse of what, over the 20 years since, has been a defining feature of Mr. Putin’s rule: his ability to present himself and his country as standing far taller than objective facts would seem to justify. It is not all just legerdemain. “Maybe he’s holding small cards, but he seems unafraid to play them,” said Michael McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Moscow and now a scholar at Stanford. “That’s what makes Putin so scary.”  Mr. Putin acknowledged as much in an interview with the film director Oliver Stone. “The question is not about having much power,” he said. “It’s about using the power you have in the right way.” Mr. Putin has harnessed Russian patriotism, which he described in his recent year-end news conference as “the only possible ideology in modern, democratic society,” to achieve some real results, notably curbing the disorder of the Yeltsin era, along with the freedoms. He crushed a rebellion in Chechnya, which he visited just hours after taking office in a show of can-do bravado, modernized the armed forces and reined in — driving into exile, jailing or simply terrifying — the oligarchs who, under Mr. Yeltsin, had done so much to discredit capitalism and democracy. He has nurtured a new clique of obedient oligarchs loyal to the Kremlin. All the same, said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political scientist who worked for more than a decade as a Kremlin adviser, Russia under Mr. Putin still reminds him of a sci-fi movie exoskeleton: “Inside is sitting a small, weak and perhaps frightened person, but from the outside it looks terrifying.” Russia’s economy is dwarfed by that of America’s, which is more than 10 times bigger in dollar terms; it is too small to make even a list of the top 10, and it grew by around just 1 percent this year. Nor does Russia pack much cultural punch beyond its borders, despite excelling in classical music, ballet and many other arts. South Korea, thanks to K-pop and its movies, has more reach.  Yet Russia has become a lodestar for autocrats and aspiring autocrats around the world, a pioneer of the media and other tools — known in Russia as “political technologies” — that these leaders now deploy, with or without Moscow’s help, to disrupt a world order once dominated by the United States. These include the propagation of fake or at least highly misleading news; the masking of simple facts with complicated conspiracy theories; and denunciations of political rivals as traitors or, in a term President Trump borrowed from Stalin, “enemies of the people.” Whatever its problems, Mr. Surkov, the Kremlin adviser, said, Russia has created “the ideology of the future” by dispensing with the “illusion of choice” offered by the West and rooting itself in the will of a single leader capable of swiftly making the choices without constraint. China, too, has advocated autocracy as the way to get results fast, but even Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, can’t match the lightning speed with which Mr. Putin ordered and executed the seizure of Crimea. The decision to grab the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine was made at a single all-night Kremlin meeting in February 2014 and then carried out just four days later with the dispatch of a few score Russian special forces officers to seize a handful of government buildings in Simferopol, the Crimean capital. The temptations of authoritarianism à la Russe have found fertile ground in countries that long saw themselves as bastions of Western values like Hungary and Poland, and that had long histories of hostility toward Moscow. They have seduced voters elsewhere in Europe, too, and also in parts of the United States. Mr. Pavlovsky, the former Kremlin adviser, said he was stunned during a recent trip to Western Europe to have people tell him “how lucky we are in Russia to have such a brilliant and strong president.” “There is almost a consensus that Putin is a great man, a resurrection of de Gaulle,” he said. “Putin thinks this himself. It is not just an illusion, because it works.” Not all Russians are convinced, particularly the young in Moscow and St. Petersburg, who staged protests over the summer to declare that Mr. Putin’s time is up.  But the security forces quickly put an end to that, using often brutal force, and Mr. Putin’s approval rating nationwide, which had dipped slightly, is now back up to around 70 percent, according to an opinion poll published in November by the Levada Center.  This is down from the period of nationalist euphoria that followed the annexation of Crimea  but is still remarkably high in a country with stagnant growth and, for many, shrinking prospects. Heartened by the shifting winds in Russia’s direction, and his own, in an  interview with The Financial Times, he pronounced dead the West’s governing creed since the end of World War II. The ideology of liberal democracy, he said, “has outlived its purpose.” Russian mind games have been particularly successful in the United States, which Mr. Putin and his officials regularly accuse of paranoid Russophobia but whose fixation on Russia has only multiplied the force of its influence. Moscow’s efforts to sow division through Facebook and other social media platforms were low-budget and often primitive, but they have had a disproportionate effect on the American political process. The result is a state of fretful and anything-goes uncertainty, a condition summed up by Peter Pomerantsev, a Soviet-born British author, in the title of his 2014 book about Mr. Putin’s Russia: “Nothing is True and Everything is Possible.” In Russia, Ms. Khrushcheva said, “it’s not what is on the surface, it’s doublespeak, triple-think. That’s why we are so good at art.” When Mr. Putin first took charge after Mr. Yeltsin’s surprise resignation on the eve of the new millennium, he declared his commitment to a very different direction for Russia than the one he has since taken.  Bid farewell by Mr. Yeltsin on the steps of the Kremlin with a melancholy request that he “take care of Russia,” Mr. Putin appeared on television a few hours later to deliver his first New Year Eve’s address to the nation, vowing to “protect freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of the mass media, ownership rights, these fundamental elements of a civilized society.” He delivered much the same message a year and a half later in a historic speech, the first by a Russian leader, in the Reichstag in Berlin, sketching a vision of Russia as inextricably bound to Europe and its values. By 2002, however, he was already growing weary of Russia being viewed as a supplicant junior partner. “Russia was never as strong as it wants to be, and never as weak as it is thought to be,” he warned.  Bitterly disillusioned with the West on security issues, in 2007 Mr. Putin delivered a speech in Munich bristling with resentment and anger at American unilateralism and disregard for Russian opposition to the expansion of NATO. “They bring us to the abyss of one conflict after another,” he said, creating such insecurity that “nobody feels safe.” But the real turning point, said Mr. Pavlovsky, who was then working in the Kremlin, came a year later with the meltdown of  global financial systems. “For Putin this was a decisive threshold,” he said. “Before this he orientated himself toward America. Yes, he disliked in the extreme what the Americans were doing around the world, but all the same he saw America as the strongest economy that runs the world economic system. Suddenly it turned out: no, they are not running anything.” This, Mr. Pavlovsky said, “was the moment of truth,” when “all the old norms vanished.” Since then, he said, Russia has set about creating its own norms. “Reality is not a children’s matinee or the handing out of mandarin oranges,” he said. “In other words, things simply don’t look like you thought they do, like you wanted them to, like you expected them to.”']","Its economy is sputtering and its young people are frustrated, but with America and Europe in tumult, Russia and its leader of two decades are on a roll."
A Test for Foreign Teachers in Indonesia: Are You Gay?,2019-12-23,By Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — Agree or disagree, the exam asked: “I would feel uncomfortable knowing my daughter’s or son’s teacher was homosexual.” Or this, true or false: “The gender composition of an orgy would be irrelevant to my decision to participate.” In recent weeks, foreign teachers at some private schools in Indonesia have been required to answer these questions and many more like them in what has been billed as a psychological exam. The goal is to determine teachers’ sexual orientation and attitude toward gay rights under a 2015 government regulation that prohibits international schools from hiring foreign teachers who have “an indication of abnormal sexual behavior or orientation.” “For foreign teachers, if the psychologist declares that a candidate has a deviant sexual orientation, certainly the school will not hire that person,” said Waadarrahman, an official with the Ministry of Education and Culture. Like many Indonesians, she uses one name. The test comes as lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people face growing hostility across Indonesia, which was once seen as among the most tolerant countries in the Islamic world. Officially secular, Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population.  In September, Parliament came close to passing an overhaul of the criminal code that would have effectively outlawed gay and lesbian relations. A similar proposal is expected to come up in the new year. In Bekasi Regency, which adjoins the capital city, Jakarta, the Child Protection Agency said this month that it had used police records to identify 4,000 people who suffer from the “disease” of being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Promoting theories debunked in the West, the agency’s commissioner, Mohamad Rojak, told reporters that “the majority of sexual disorientation” was caused by “carefree lifestyles” and urged the people on his list to overcome their condition by getting “therapy.” The crackdown on L.G.B.T. people in Indonesian workplaces extends beyond schools. The office of Indonesia’s attorney general, which is responsible for enforcing laws against discrimination, last month said on its website that job applicants must not have “sexual orientation disorders” or “behavioral deviations.” “We just want the normal ones,” a spokesman for the attorney general’s office, Mukri, told reporters. “We don’t want the odd ones.” Homosexuality is currently not illegal in Indonesia except in the autonomous province of Aceh, where gays and lesbians can be caned under Shariah, the Islamic legal code. But the country’s new vice president, Ma’ruf Amin, formerly a leading Islamic cleric, has long supported criminalization and harsh punishment of gays and lesbians. The teacher-testing requirement was adopted after a contentious 2014 case in which a Canadian educator and six Indonesians were accused of sexually abusing young students at the prestigious Jakarta International School. All seven were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms on the basis of preposterous evidence, including that the Canadian, Neil Bantleman, used magical powers to seduce the children and render the crime scenes invisible. He was granted clemency in June and freed after serving five years. Officials say one purpose of the testing regulation was to prevent foreign pedophiles from being hired as teachers. But the psychological exam questions reviewed by The New York Times focus instead on sexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuality. Ms. Waadarrahman, the education ministry official, said the regulation applies to 168 schools, including the renamed Jakarta Intercultural School, that offer an international curriculum. Many of the schools attract wealthy Indonesians who want their children to have access to an international education with Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate programs. The Jakarta Intercultural School’s headmaster, Tarek Razik, declined to comment on the regulation or how the school handles the psychological screening of its teachers. The recent wave of testing has alarmed some foreign teachers who are concerned that schools or government officials are seeking to remove teachers who may be gay or lesbian. But teachers who were critical of the test declined to speak out publicly for fear of losing their jobs. Under the regulation, the schools are required to have a psychologist certify that each teacher does not have a behavior disorder or an “abnormal sexual orientation.” Enforcement of the regulation, however, is haphazard. Each school is left to hire a psychologist to conduct the teacher certification process, which is required both before a teacher is hired and every six years when a school’s accreditation is renewed. There is no standardized exam. The testing procedure is left to individual schools and some versions of the exam are more intrusive than others.  One school that administered the test last month was the Mentari Intercultural School in Jakarta. The exam included many behavioral questions, at least 38 of which dealt with sexual orientation and attitudes toward gay rights, according to pages of the test provided to The New York Times. While the intention of the regulation might have been to root out predators, many of the questions covered attitudes toward gay rights. For example, agree or disagree: • “A sexual education curriculum should include all sexual orientations.” • “Celebrations such as gay pride day are ridiculous because they assume an individual’s sexual orientation should constitute a source of pride.” • “Teachers should try to reduce their student’s prejudice toward homosexuality.” Many questions appeared to be derived from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, which is designed to assess personality traits and psychopathology. Other questions aimed to show where each teacher fit on the Kinsey Scale of sexual orientation. Many of the questions were personal. These were asked of men: • “I wouldn’t want to die without having experimented sexually with both men and women.” • “I can be sexually attracted to anyone in the right circumstances.” • “I am only attracted to men.” Mentari school officials did not respond to questions about the test. A psychologist in the city of Bandung, Ifa H. Misbach, said she declined a school’s request to prepare such an exam because it would be unethical for members of her profession to engage in discriminatory practices. “It is weird for me, in my humble opinion,” she said in an interview. “Psychologists cannot discriminate on the basis of sexuality.” She noted that attitudes toward homosexuality are very conservative in Indonesia, where being gay is widely seen as a choice, not a characteristic determined by birth. “It is different from American culture,” she said. “Every day they have to hide from a society that judges them badly.” Discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation in hiring is “against Indonesia’s constitution, and against Indonesia’s obligations under international human rights law,” said Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International Indonesia. The advocacy director for the Support Group and Resource Center on Sexuality Studies, Riska Carolina, said gays and lesbians face increasing government obstacles in many areas of society, including barriers to scholarships or high-profile positions in sports programs. “The pattern is clear,” she said. “If there are groups that are considered different, they get excluded instead of getting taken care of.” Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","Under a government regulation, teachers at some international schools face intrusive questions aimed at identifying those with “abnormal” sexual orientations.

Traffic Circles Are Everywhere in France. Not Everyone Is Happy.,2019-12-25,By Aurelien Breeden,"['ABBEVILLE, France — Every day, about 65,000 vehicles cruise through the center of Abbeville, passing by its Gothic church, City Hall and rows of red brick houses, with many drivers on their way to the English Channel about a dozen miles away. But they never stop for a red light. None exist in this town of about 25,000 people. Instead, drivers bank, swerve and loop their way through traffic circle after traffic circle.  Their ubiquity in Abbeville is an extreme example of France’s unabashed embrace of the roundabout, found in abundance throughout the country and widely credited for making roads safer and less clogged.  Even in Abbeville, on a recent morning, workers in fluorescent orange vests and hard hats were breaking ground on yet another traffic circle, as cars were backed up by the construction. Roundabouts played a central role in the Yellow Vests protests, when demonstrators occupied hundreds of the nation’s roundabouts, blocking traffic as a way to demonstrate against a despised fuel tax increase in particular and a growing sense of inequality in general. But France’s relationship with them has in some ways soured, their very pervasiveness making them a convenient scapegoat for many of France’s ills, real or perceived.  Pierre Vermeren, a French historian writing in Le Figaro last year, said roundabouts were a “symbol of ugly France” and the “emblem of French malaise.”  There are no official statistics, but estimates of the total number of traffic circles in France range from 20,000 to 50,000. In the United States — about 18 times bigger and five times more populous than France — the figure is closer to 5,000.  [Read: Departing: Two Shopkeepers, Their Cat and Part of Paris’s Soul.] For some, the roundabout, a concept imported from Britain in the 1970s and quickly spread by the firm hand of the French state, embodies the unchecked spending of taxpayer money on pet projects by government officials, especially mayors, who in the 1980s took over road management from the central government.  Many officials “saw the roundabout as a kind of fashionable object,” said Éric Alonzo, a professor at the École d’architecture de la ville & des territoires in suburban Paris who has written a book on traffic circles.  “I heard from technicians who weren’t necessarily recommending that solution,” he said, “but elected officials were saying, ‘I want one.’” For others, roundabouts are a constant reminder of an overreliance on cars and have come to symbolize deeper worries about French cultural identity, as urban sprawl and giant malls suck the life out of city centers, killing traditional bakers and butchers.  “Roundabouts have become the focal point that symbolizes, to the point of caricature, everything else’s flaws,” Mr. Alonzo said.  If there was anyone left in France who didn’t have an opinion about them, that changed last year during the Yellow Vest protests.  “The France of roundabouts” has even become the shorthand way to describe the small cities and towns in peripheral France, where many feel left behind, and where the Yellow Vest protests spontaneously started before migrating to Paris in what became months of often violent protests.  In Abbeville last year, some Yellow Vest protesters first gathered at one of the town’s biggest roundabouts, near a major shopping mall.  It was once the site of a sugar refinery so large that in May 1940, after German bombs set it on fire, 35,000 tons of sugar were transformed into caramel, sending residents rushing into the street with pots and pans to scoop up the precious syrup. Like many of northern France’s former industrial powerhouses, all that remains today of that factory is a single, giant smokestack. On a recent visit, there were no Yellow Vests in sight at the roundabout. Their protests have been tamped down by a combination of government concessions and police repression at protest sites. And the focus of worker anger in France has switched of late to the plans of President Emmanuel Macron to streamline the nation’s convoluted pension system. Whatever anyone thinks of roundabouts as symbols of an ailing France, the residents of Abbeville concede that, in practical terms, they make life on the road easier. Even during the summer, with seaside-bound vacationers from around the region using the city’s streets and bridges over the Somme River, the roundabouts keep cars moving.  “I didn’t wake up one morning and say to myself, ‘What if I removed all the traffic lights?’” said Nicolas Dumont, the mayor of Abbeville. “It’s a very pragmatic policy.” To cut down on the noise, traffic jams and fender benders occurring at one intersection, Mr. Dumont decided in 2010 to turn the troublesome spot into a roundabout. It solved the problems. Ten more traffic circles followed. In October, the city’s only remaining traffic light was sawed down. Mélanie Cathelin, who runs a toy store on one of Abbeville’s main shopping streets, said she now finds traffic lights in other cities jarring, whether in neighboring Amiens or on a recent vacation in Florida. “It’s almost annoying,” Ms. Cathelin said. Roundabouts, she granted, “work pretty well.”  Freddy Roger, a roofer sipping a beer at the Green Harp, a pub next to where the last traffic light once stood, said roundabouts used up “less electricity,” were “prettier” and safer.  “With a traffic light, it’s not just a minor accident,” he added, slamming one hand into the other. “It’s frontal.” For one Abbeville resident, the absence of traffic lights was something of a professional hindrance. Christophe Blotas, a driving instructor, said he has to take his students to another town to teach them how to handle the red, green and amber.  There is no denying, Mr. Alonzo said, that the spread of roundabouts has given France’s roadways an air of visual uniformity, creating traffic features that look similar no matter where you are. To counter that blandness, local authorities sometimes decorate traffic circles, but some of their choices have come under fire as aesthetically questionable, like a giant yellow arm adorned with careening autos, which burned last year after Yellow Vest protesters set fire to the camp they had set up in its shadow.  A roundabout in the eastern town of Pontarlier, where drivers are greeted by an oversized red face purporting to depict André Malraux, the French writer, was last year voted France’s “worst.” But Mr. Alonzo said roundabouts were often unfairly blamed for the policies that produce them, like unrestricted commercial zoning on city outskirts that pulls in lots of traffic and creates a need for access ramps, parking lots — and multiple roundabouts.  “Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water,” Mr. Alonzo said, arguing that roundabouts “have their relevance, but it all depends where and how.”']","Traffic circles are ubiquitous in France, accepted as safer than traditional intersections. But they have also become an emblem of the country’s ailments, from urban sprawl to inequality. "
Christmas Eve Wildfire in Chile Destroys Dozens of Homes,2019-12-25,By Pascale Bonnefoy,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — A wildfire raged through a residential area on the outskirts of the Chilean city of Valparaíso, prompting evacuation orders and destroying more than 200 homes by Wednesday, Chile’s interior minister said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday, was only partly under control by Wednesday, but had begun to shift from populated areas to forested land, the interior minister, Gonzalo Blumel, said. There were no reports of casualties as residents had been evacuated.  The mayor of Valparaíso, Jorge Sharp, told local news outlets early Wednesday that there were indications that the fire had been set on purpose.  “This fire presents characteristics of evident intentionality,” Mr. Sharp told the national television station, citing the fact that fire appeared to start in several places at around the same time.  The fire’s rapid spread was worsened by steady winds and warm, dry weather that came as the country experienced its worst drought on record, according to government officials.  “2019 has been the year with the least rainfall in history, as far as records show, and it has worsened over the past few months, beyond all our expectations,” said Alfredo Moreno, the minister of public works, in a news conference last week.  Wildfires, which are exacerbated by climate change, have caused widespread destruction in Australia, Brazil, the United States and other countries this year. Valparaíso is a port city in central Chile filled with vividly painted homes that line its hillside streets. It has seen large fires in years past, including one that left 12 dead in 2014.  Photos taken in the city on Tuesday showed homes engulfed in flames. The affected area includes some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods, where the rugged topography and narrow, winding roads make access difficult for firefighters.  The roads in some of the affected neighborhoods are unpaved and homes can lack running water. The municipal government sends trucks with water to supply residents a couple of times a week. The housing can be precarious, made of tin, cardboard or wood. In a post on Twitter early on Wednesday, Mr. Sharp, the mayor, said city officials had declared an emergency in the local area to “facilitate debris removal and reconstruction.”  “In addition, we will file a complaint against those who are responsible for the obvious intentionality of this fire,” the mayor wrote. Two shelters were set up for those displaced by the fire, according to a statement from city officials. Chile’s president, Sebastián Piñera, said in a statement posted on his Twitter account that emergency responders were working “tirelessly” to combat the blaze. “We deeply regret the fire that affects so many families in the hills of Valparaíso and especially on Christmas Eve,” he said.']",Firefighters struggled to control the blaze on a hillside in Valparaíso. The city’s mayor said the fire might have been set intentionally.
Mexico Calls Amplified Police Presence at Bolivia Embassy a ‘Siege’,2019-12-24,By Cesar Del Castillo and Julie Turkewitz,"['LA PAZ, Bolivia — Amid a political crisis that has consumed the country for more than two months, the Bolivian police have stepped up their presence around the Mexican Embassy, which has given refuge to allies of the country’s former president, Evo Morales. The Mexican government said that the operation was “clearly meant to intimidate” people at the embassy, and that it represented a “siege” against individuals seeking protection under international law.  Roberto Velasco, a spokesman for Mexico’s foreign ministry, said that about 70 Bolivian police officers were posted in the vicinity of the embassy on Tuesday, more than doubling the typical police presence in the area. He also said the officers had been recording embassy employees and trying to search their vehicles.  The former Bolivian government officials who have sought refuge at the embassy include Mr. Morales’s chief of staff and his former ministers of defense, justice and culture, according to Mr. Velasco. An official in the government of Bolivia’s interim president, Jeanine Añez, said in a statement that the actions were meant to prevent Mr. Morales’s allies from fleeing the country. “We will not allow this,” said Wilson Santamaría, a recently appointed security minister, calling the allies of the former president “fugitives.”  Bolivia has been in a state of turmoil since October, when Mr. Morales claimed that he had won a disputed election. Soon, thousands of Bolivians were protesting in the streets and the military turned against him. He then fled to Mexico. Mr. Morales, a leftist and the nation’s first Indigenous president, was replaced by Ms. Añez, a little-known senator who took office holding aloft a large Bible and promising to “bring back” democracy and tranquillity to Bolivia. Mr. Morales has since left Mexico for Argentina, where the government has granted him asylum. The government of Ms. Añez responded by issuing a warrant for Mr. Morales’s arrest, charging him with sedition and terrorism. Cesar Del Castillo reported from La Paz, Bolivia, and Julie Turkewitz from Medellín, Colombia.']","Several high-ranking officials who served with Evo Morales, the former president, have sought refuge in Mexico’s embassy in La Paz.

"Notre-Dame Will Not Host Christmas Mass, a First in More Than 200 Years",2019-12-23,By Aurelien Breeden,"['Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris will not hold Christmas services this week for the first time in over two centuries, as workers continue to shore up the fragile building after a devastating fire.  The 850-year-old cathedral has been closed to the public since a blaze tore through the structure in April, destroying a latticework of ancient timbers in its roof, sending the spire crashing down and spreading tons of toxic dust around Paris.  Records show that Christmas Masses have been celebrated at Notre-Dame every year since at least 1803, after the cathedral was handed back to the Roman Catholic Church following the French Revolution, according to André Finot, a spokesman for the cathedral.  Mr. Finot said that the cathedral’s rector would instead hold this year’s Christmas service at the Église St.-Germain l’Auxerrois, a church near the Louvre where Notre-Dame’s religious services have been relocated since the fire.  “It’s very hard for everyone, it’s yet another blow,” Mr. Finot said by telephone on Monday.  President Emmanuel Macron of France vowed after the fire that Notre-Dame would be rebuilt in five years, a tight deadline that the authorities are sticking to so far.  Jean-Louis Georgelin, an army general nominated by Mr. Macron to lead the task force in charge of reconstruction, promised this month that a religious service would be held inside Notre-Dame on April 16, 2024, exactly five years after the fire, to “celebrate the work that will have been done.” Recovery efforts continue at the cathedral, which was added in October to the 2020 World Monuments Watch, a biennial list of cultural heritage sites that are in urgent need of conservation. The authorities caution that Notre-Dame is in an extremely precarious state and in need of constant monitoring to ensure parts of it do not collapse. The vault is still punctured by gaping holes, and the flying buttresses are propped up by giant wooden blocks.  But the most urgent threat to Notre-Dame is thousands of scaffolding tubes — remnants of renovation work from before the fire — that were welded together by the blaze, creating a mass of twisted metal of roughly 250 tons that is weighing down on the structure. Workers are currently erecting a 200-foot crane that will loom above the cathedral to help finalize the operations needed to stabilize that welded scaffolding.  New scaffolding is also being assembled. Workers will then use that perch to carefully cut the welded tubes and remove them one by one. Those operations are scheduled to start in February.  “The workers are very motivated,” said Mr. Finot, the cathedral spokesman. “Everyone is working relentlessly. They are really putting their heart into it.” The exact cause of the fire is not yet known. Investigators are focusing on the possibility of a short circuit in the electrified bells of the spire, or in the elevators that had been set up on the old scaffolding. They are also considering cigarette butts, which were found on the scaffolding, apparently left by workers.']","The Paris cathedral, which suffered a devastating fire this year, is still closed to the public as reconstruction efforts slowly get underway."
Speaking Out on Gay Rights and Corruption Costs Ambassador His Job,2019-12-24,By Ruth Maclean,"['The United States recalled its ambassador to Zambia on Monday after he criticized the government for sending a gay couple to prison and accused officials of stealing millions of dollars of public funds. The ambassador, Daniel L. Foote had, described the treatment of the gay couple as “horrifying” — setting off outrage in Zambia, a conservative Christian country. But analysts said that the main reason for his departure was that he had repeatedly declared that ministry officials had misappropriated millions.  In an unusually combative public statement for a member of the diplomatic corps, Mr. Foote had said that the Zambian government “wants foreign diplomats to be compliant, with open pocketbooks and closed mouths\u200b.” Mr. Foote’s comments set off recriminations in Zambia, a copper-producing, landlocked country in southern Africa. Zambia’s president, Edgar Lungu, said he did not want Mr. Foote in the country, even if Zambia risked losing its annual $500 million in American aid. “We don’t want such people in our midst. We want him gone,” President Lungu told the state-owned television channel ZNBC on Sunday.  He later told Sky News: “If that is how you are going to bring your aid, then I’m afraid the West can leave us alone in our poverty. And we’ll continue scrounging and struggling.” The State Department said in a statement that it was dismayed the Zambian government had declared that Mr. Foote’s position as ambassador was “no longer tenable.” The department said that his remarks were “the equivalent of a declaration that the ambassador is persona non grata.”  Mr. Foote is a career diplomat who was appointed ambassador to Zambia by President Trump in November 2017. In his statement, released in early December, Mr. Foote said that the Zambian foreign minister had accused him of interfering in internal affairs for speaking out about the “harsh sentencing of a homosexual couple.”  Despite all of the aid Zambia receives, the ambassador wrote, he had found it very difficult to get an audience with the president. “Both the American taxpayers, and Zambian citizens, deserve a privileged, two-way partnership, not a one-way donation that works out to $200 million per meeting with the head of state,” Mr. Foote wrote. The administration of Mr. Lungu, who was elected in 2015 after his predecessor died in office, has been widely criticized as corrupt. One Zambian analyst recently called it “kleptocratic,” saying that grand corruption had become endemic and that the economy was faltering.  A recent report by the Environmental Investigation Agency, an international organization that investigates environmental crime and abuse, described the president, his daughter and two ministers as central figures in a “cartel” that traffics mukula rosewood trees. It said that the trees were on the verge of commercial extinction. Mr. Foote had spoken out about corruption in Zambia before. “His voice is powerful. He had exposed their hypocrisy and corruption,” said the popular musician Fumba Chama, who has repeatedly criticized government corruption in songs like “Koswe Mumpoto,” which means “Rat in the Pot.” Mr. Chama — whose stage name, Pilato, stands for People In Lyrical Arena Taking Over — has been targeted by the government multiple times. He was last arrested in Livingstone on Saturday while running a workshop on transparency and accountability, charged with unlawful assembly, and released two days later. He said that the furor over the ambassador’s comments on gay rights was just a pretext and that the real issue was his bold condemnation of corrupt officials. “They brought up the L.G.B.T. thing because they knew if they brought it to the fore, the public would side with them. Zambia is a very religious country,” Mr. Chama said. Gay relationships are against the law in many African countries, but gay people confront a broad range of conditions across the continent. The prosecution of the two Zambian men, for what the government called “crimes against the order of nature,” is not unique on the continent. In its statement, the State Department said: “The United States firmly opposes abuses against L.G.B.T.I. persons. Governments have an obligation to ensure that all people can freely enjoy the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms to which they are entitled.” It quoted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying, “We abhor violations of these rights, whenever and wherever they are encountered.” However, some State Department officials have said they have seen a rollback in advocacy for gay rights under President Trump and Mr. Pompeo. Diplomats recently requested permission to fly rainbow flags at the American Embassy and Consulate in Brazil, where the openly anti-gay, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was elected last year, but Washington refused. Mr. Pompeo has installed a new human rights panel to review the State Department’s definition of human rights, which some critics say is a move to curtail advocacy for the rights of L.G.B.T. people.  Conservative American evangelicals have been accused of promoting opposition to gay rights across Africa. In Zambia, evangelical Christianity is a dominant force in society and the political arena. Many Zambians were introduced to North American evangelism in the 1990s through shows like Pat Robertson’s “700 Club.” Edward Wong contributed reporting from Washington.']",Zambia’s president wanted U.S. Ambassador Daniel Foote gone after he criticized the government for corruption and for sending a gay couple to prison. 
Japanese Lawmaker Is Arrested in Casino Bribery Investigation,2019-12-25,By Ben Dooley,"['TOKYO — A member of Japan’s Parliament was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that wanted to build one of the first casinos in Japan, which legalized them just three years ago. Prosecutors arrested the lawmaker, Tsukasa Akimoto, of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, on allegations of accepting about $34,000 in cash and other gifts from the company, which was not identified in documents filed by prosecutors. Mr. Akimoto, who has yet to be formally charged, has denied wrongdoing. Parliament legalized casino gambling in 2016 despite public opposition, and Mr. Akimoto’s arrest could be a blow to the nascent industry. Lawmakers put significant restrictions on casino licensing to address concerns about the potential for money laundering and gambling addiction, and no casinos have yet opened. Documents filed by prosecutors outline a plan by three men associated with the unnamed company to secure Mr. Akimoto’s help with its project — building a casino on the northern island of Hokkaido — in exchange for gifts. All three men have been arrested. NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, reported that the company was 500.com, a Chinese company specializing in online sports betting. The company declined to comment on Wednesday. Mr. Akimoto, 48, is a member of the lower house of Parliament, where he was an advocate of legalizing casinos. Prosecutors say that the bribery occurred in 2017 and 2018, when he was a senior official at the country’s tourism ministry, overseeing efforts to develop the casino industry. Japanese prosecutors raided Mr. Akimoto’s office last week over suspicions that an associate had smuggled cash into the country. Before his arrest, Mr. Akimoto wrote on Twitter, “I have not participated in anything illegal at all.” He quit the Liberal Democratic Party on Wednesday. Also Wednesday, prosecutors searched the office of Takaki Shirasuka, a lawmaker from the same party, as part of the investigation, according to Kyodo News.  When lawmakers legalized casino gambling in 2016, they cited a need to stimulate Japan’s sluggish economy and find new sources of revenue. Some forms of gambling are legal in Japan, including lotteries and betting on certain kinds of races. And the authorities have long turned a blind eye to gambling in Japan’s ubiquitous pachinko parlors.  But the decision to allow blackjack, roulette and other table games into Japan opened up a potentially enormous new market for casino operators around the world. Analysts have said that it could be worth as much as $40 billion and rival Macau, China, as Asia’s gambling capital. The American companies MGM, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts joined competitors from China and Australia in jostling to enter Japan first.  To appease opponents of casino gambling — including Komeito, a Buddhist political party allied with the Liberal Democratic Party — legalization came with caveats. Casinos must be part of “integrated resorts” featuring other attractions, like hotels, shops and conference centers, and only three licenses would be granted, at least initially. NHK reported that Mr. Akimoto had traveled in December 2017 to the Chinese city of Shenzhen, where he met with representatives from 500.com. A few months later, he met with officials from a village in Hokkaido where the company hoped to develop a resort, it said. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, declined to answer questions about the case during a regular news conference on Wednesday, but he said there was no rule preventing officials from associating with industry representatives. He also said the government would “steadily progress” toward the goal of opening casinos. In November, Hokkaido announced that it would not pursue the development of an integrated resort for the time being, citing environmental concerns. That leaves Osaka and Yokohama, among other places, in the running to host the first three resorts. Final bid proposals are expected to be submitted to the government by early 2021.

What Should Europe Do About Viktor Orban and ‘Illiberal Democracy’?,2019-12-23,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Donald Tusk grew up inside Poland’s Solidarity movement, the workers’ revolt that combined with intellectuals to bring down the Communist regime in the face of a Soviet threat of invasion and then martial law. “Solidarity” has been a key part of Mr. Tusk’s ideology and his life. The workers’ rebellion, which began at the shipyard in his hometown, Gdansk, gave him, as a bored young man who was something of a hooligan, real meaning. Solidarity remains, he said in a recent interview, “my favorite word.” But it also symbolizes his greatest failure as president of the European Council, the grouping of the European Union’s member states, a job he has just left after a five-year term. Despite Mr. Tusk’s passionate pleas, sometimes awkward jokes and Twitter commentary, the European Union signally failed to show the solidarity he demanded on the biggest issue of the last five years — migration.  The crisis fed identity politics and populism in countries like Germany, Hungary, Italy and Mr. Tusk’s Poland, and helped set Britain on its path out of the European Union — another painful failure for Mr. Tusk, who had been fervently against Brexit.  “You can’t force solidarity,’’ Mr. Tusk, 62, said rather sadly, reflecting on his tenure and the state of Europe. “Enforced solidarity is an oxymoron.’’  But he said that was precisely what some of his European partners wanted to do. ‘‘This is why some countries were really angry,’’ Mr. Tusk said.  Some of these same countries, especially in Central Europe, are happy to accept European solidarity when it means agricultural and regional aid funds from Brussels. But the problems of migrants, borders and Islamophobia were all stoked domestically, with Brussels as a handy scapegoat. The conflict was particularly complicated, even emotionally so, with Mr. Tusk’s old friend and anti-Communist colleague, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban. And he is now even more Mr. Tusk’s problem.  Mr. Tusk has just begun a new job in Brussels as head of a center-right party grouping called the European People’s Party. Mr. Orban and his Fidesz party are prominent members, and Mr. Tusk’s predecessor did very little to rein in Mr. Orban, because the party needed his votes in the European Parliament. So what will Mr. Tusk do? Mr. Tusk is struggling to answer, because he has seen the transformation of Mr. Orban from an idealistic anti-Communist to a populist authoritarian, dabbling in Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and proud of creating an “illiberal democracy.’’ “I have a problem with Viktor Orban, but also a private one, a personal one,’’ Mr. Tusk said. “Because we have known each other for so many years and our friendship started when he was one of the most talented and promising liberal democrats in our part of Europe,” who stood up to the Communist authorities in 1989. “When I was president of the European Council he was my partner, and paradoxically, also because of our old friendship, we were personally very loyal to each other,’’ Mr. Tusk said. Then he hesitated, sighed, then said, “This is why it is something painful for me, because I like him as a person.’’ Mr. Orban is smart, Mr. Tusk agreed. “You know this is why I think he is cynical, because he is too intelligent not to understand what is the problem. And of course cynicism is nothing new in politics, but the practical consequences of his cynicism in Hungary are,’’ he stopped again, then said: “I think it went too far. At least it’s my opinion.’’ That opinion is shared by many, but Mr. Orban, by using his mandate to alter the Hungarian Constitution to his benefit, remains a powerful force inside the European Union and for populist, identitarian and anti-Brussels politics generally. His challenge to the rule of law is even more profound than that of the government of Poland. A request for comment from Mr. Orban was not answered. Once the highly praised prime minister of Poland, who resigned in 2014 to run the European Council, Mr. Tusk and his party lost the 2015 election to the populist Law and Justice party and its effective leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, now his archrival. As part of Mr. Kaczynski’s campaign against the European-minded heirs of Solidarity, he has even accused Mr. Tusk of being responsible for the 2010 plane crash in Russia that killed his twin brother, Lech Kaczynski, then Poland’s president. “Yeah, yeah, I’m a murderer, a thief,’’ Mr. Tusk responds, laughing. “I will survive anyway, I am quite experienced here, so this is nothing new for me.’’ But the intensity of the attacks represents something new, he said, a reflection of a broader problem with democratic debate he sees in Europe, the United States and Britain, over Brexit.  “It’s this shameless use of state-organized lies as a permanent tool and permanent method,’’ he said. Ten years ago, he said, “it would be something disqualifying for politicians,’’ but no longer. Now it cuts to the heart of the European Union’s idea of liberal democracy, shared values and the rule of law. And this is what is so troubling about the current trends in Central Europe, especially in Poland and in Hungary. “For me the red line is if someone is able and is ready to accept our fundamental set of values,’’ Mr. Tusk said. “We can describe this set with the simple term ‘liberal democracy.’ ”  That, he said, included a commitment to “freedom of speech, political pluralism, respect for the individual, tolerance, openness” — everything that used to be clear, and now is under threat. Still, he admits, the problem of Mr. Orban is even harder, because many in Europe, including Mr. Tusk, think he was correct in his strong defense of Europe’s borders against uncontrolled immigration, inspired in part by the controversial decision of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to open her country’s borders. Mr. Orban argued that Europe could not preserve the borderless internal Schengen area unless it defended Schengen’s own borders. He then reinforced Hungary’s with guards and barbed wire, herding migrants who tried to cross illegally into holding areas and refusing to take any Brussels-imposed quota of asylum-seekers, all to much publicity. “From the very beginning, I was absolutely sure that in some part of his approach he was right,’’ Mr. Tusk said. While despising Mr. Orban’s rhetoric, he said, he saw that “the conflict between Orban and Merkel was something really very substantive.’’ ‘‘At the end of the day,’’ he said, ‘‘not only the European People’s Party but the whole European family understood that if you want to have an asylum policy you have to be able to control the external borders.’’ What damaged Ms. Merkel was the sense of chaos and loss of control. But Mr. Orban understood, Mr. Tusk said, that “the first condition is order, absolutely.” And that brought Mr. Tusk, as a liberal democrat, to what he describes as his nightmare. “The biggest fear today, not only in Europe, is that people think that liberalism is a synonym for vulnerability and disorder and chaos and weakness,’’ he said.  “Liberal democracy must be also strong and decisive and sometimes even ruthless in protecting, you know, their own people, borders, territories, etc.,’’ he added. ‘‘If people start to believe that there is no possibility to combine freedom and a liberal set of values with safety and security and order, then we have no chance to survive.’’  Then, the field will be open to even more dictatorial populist politicians, he said. As for what he will do about Mr. Orban, Mr. Tusk refused to answer, citing a coming report from former party notables, including his predecessor as Council president, Herman Van Rompuy. Mr. Tusk said he will then make a formal recommendation to the larger party in February. But the politics remain awkward, Mr. Tusk admitted. “I can recommend some solutions,’’ he said, adding: “Of course, it’s a problem also because of this migration debate. Because almost no one in the E.P.P. wants to punish Orban because of this very context.’’']","Donald Tusk is leaving his job as European Council president, but he still faces the problem presented by his old friend, transformed by power and cynicism."
Syrian Offensive Sends Tens of Thousands Fleeing,2019-12-23,By Vivian Yee and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — As many as 100,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in northwestern Syria as the government of President Bashar al-Assad and his patron, Russia, have intensified a military offensive there in recent days, aid groups said.  Trapped between the violence and a closed Turkish border, the civilians are huddling in makeshift settlements that, in many cases, lack toilets or clean water. There is no foreseeable end to the suffering for the roughly three million residents of Idlib Province, which has been slipping out of the Syrian rebels’ grip, airstrike by airstrike, skirmish by skirmish, bringing Mr. Assad increasingly close to controlling the entire country again after more than eight years of civil war.  To the north, Turkey has sealed its border, keeping displaced civilians out. Other international powers have long since stopped efforts to intervene against the government’s advances, even as they call for political change in Damascus. The renewed violence comes as the government pushes farther into Idlib, nibbling at the last patch of territory held by the Syrian opposition — in this case, rebels led by a group linked to Al Qaeda and known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Syrian Army has been pushing toward the town of Maarat al Noaman in what appears to be an effort to capture a strategic highway to Aleppo, a major city in the northwest. The past few days have brought a spike in urgency and desperation for civilians in Idlib, many of whom landed there from other parts of Syria after the government retook their home areas from the rebels. Drivers and cars were scarce as people hurried to find a way out of Maarat al Noaman, which Russian and Syrian government warplanes have been bombarding relentlessly during the latest assault. Now they are homeless, sleeping under strung-up blankets, on sidewalks and in the open, amid olive trees, in near-freezing temperatures. Zein Samer, a photographer from Maarat al Noaman, said on Sunday that he had left with nothing, not even clothing. With his family’s house and shops destroyed, he had almost nothing left. “Everything is gone,” he said. “Simply vanished.” Before leaving, he visited his brother’s grave a final time. His brother died during a previous government assault on Idlib. “At that moment, I wished a rocket would fall on me and kill me,” he said. Since the military offensive in Idlib started in the spring, at least 5,262 civilians have died, including 246 children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group. About 400,000 residents were displaced in the spring, most of them moving toward the Turkish border, and aid groups warned that the number could soar if the current campaign continues. “I don’t want to think about what’s coming next,” said Mona Khayti, a social worker who arrived in Idlib more than a year ago after her home in Douma, a Damascus suburb, was destroyed by a government offensive last year. “Our turn is coming again, and I might be displaced again. The same scenes are being repeated here in Idlib, but uglier.” Humanitarian workers said conditions for the displaced were already untenable and would probably get worse as more people arrived, in northern Idlib near the Turkish border, looking for shelter.  Whether people are sleeping in informal camps or in the open, as thousands are reportedly doing, the settlements are overcrowded, and hunger is rampant. Medical organizations have reported that 11 percent of children who come to local clinics are acutely malnourished, and food has become so expensive that nursing mothers give their infants herbal tea because they can no longer feed them, the International Rescue Committee said. Residents and local aid workers in Idlib described chaotic scenes as people fled, with some elderly people refusing to leave their homes. “It’s really stressful and sad,” said Abdulatif Mardati, who works with a local Islamic charity. “These people don’t even know where to go, what direction to go. A lot of people fled with no place to stay.” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said on Monday that more than 80,000 people had fled the bombing in recent days and moved toward the Turkish border. If more people are displaced, he warned, Europe would probably see another wave of refugees — a reminder that Mr. Erdogan is refusing to accept more from Syria. He has repeatedly threatened to relax restrictions on migrants in Turkey who have so far been prevented from trying to cross to Europe. Though the border is shut, diplomats say Turkey will not be able to keep all those fleeing from crossing into its territory. “If the atrocity against the people of Idlib doesn’t end, this number will increase,” Mr. Erdogan said at an academic award ceremony. “Turkey will not be able to carry the load of migration alone. The negative of the pressure we would be exposed to will be an issue that will be felt by European countries, primarily Greece.” While a humanitarian emergency looms in Idlib, a vital channel for delivering aid to Syrian civilians has come under threat. On Friday, Russia and China vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have allowed aid to continue flowing from Iraq and Turkey to millions of Syrian civilians for another year, as it has done for the past five years. “To Russia and China, who have chosen to make a political statement by opposing this resolution, you have blood on your hands,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. But Russia’s ambassador, who had proposed an alternate resolution that would have extended the aid deliveries for six months instead of a year, said the humanitarian situation in Syria had improved. Unless a solution is found, the legal authorization for the aid channel will expire on Jan. 10. Rehana Zawar, the International Rescue Committee’s northwest Syria director, said four million Syrian civilians relied on the aid they received via Turkey and Iraq. “The Russian and Chinese vetoes of Resolution 2449 have put the humanitarian response in Syria in jeopardy at a critical time,” she said. “The Council must urgently resume negotiations on this matter.”']","Trapped between a fierce assault and a closed Turkish border, desperate civilians are huddling in makeshift settlements, bewildered as they seek safety."
Istanbul’s New Mayor Outlines Gross Mismanagement Under Erdogan’s Allies,2019-12-23,By Carlotta Gall,"['  ISTANBUL — The new mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, has spent the last six months since his election combing over his city’s books to get a handle on how it had been run under his predecessor, an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Monday, the mayor issued his verdict: a level of mismanagement and overspending that surpassed all expectations. Things were so bad that the mayor even used a news conference to declare battle against one of Mr. Erdogan’s favorite projects, a $100 billion plan to cut a new shipping lane parallel to the Bosporus, announcing that the city was withdrawing from a protocol signed by his predecessor for what has been called Canal Istanbul. The declaration was the mayor’s first real challenge to Mr. Erdogan and the powerful vested interests that have supported him since he took control of Turkey’s largest and wealthiest city, long the power base for the president and his governing party. Mr. Imamoglu won a stunning upset to become mayor in June after the president’s party contested his apparent victory in an earlier election in March, forcing a rerun.  He took office promising to get the city’s books in order after mounting accusations by the opposition that the municipal finances had been used to the benefit of the president as well as his party, cronies and family.  In doing so, Mr. Imamoglu has quickly emerged as a strong national challenger to the president, whose popularity has waned as the economy slowed after a long stretch of unbroken growth.  Much of that growth was fueled by grandiose construction projects favored by Mr. Erdogan’s administration, the foundations of which the markets, economists and the president’s critics have questioned.  Increasingly, it seems, the bill on the spending binge is coming due.  Istanbul and its subsidiaries were in debt to the tune of 14 billion lira, roughly $2 billion, when he took over in June, Mr. Imamoglu said on Monday. The municipality’s subsidiary companies were paralyzed by tax debts and effectively bankrupt, he added. The outgoing mayor, an official appointed by Mr. Erdogan, had even received, and spent, a highly unusual advance of funds from the Treasury, leaving the incoming administration unable to pay municipal salaries, he said. “After a week there was not a single penny in our budget to pay personnel,” he said. At a recent budget meeting that was televised on the municipal channel, Mr. Imamoglu went into more detail, showing how spending had outpaced revenue over the last five years. Payment obligations, most of them foreign currency loans, had soared to more than 60 billion lira, or $10 billion, he said. “Financial discipline has gotten out of control from 2013-2014,” Mr. Imamoglu said at the meeting. “The past five years are a complete disaster in terms of financial management.” The discoveries by the mayor and his team have cast a harsh light on how Istanbul has been run under Mr. Erdogan, who has dominated the city’s affairs for the better part of 25 years, first as mayor in the 1990s and later as prime minister and president. Mr. Erdogan gained enormous popularity by providing public services from trash collection to mass transit. But he also oversaw enormous urban sprawl that critics say has irreparably ruined the fabled city. Those projects also made the president’s immediate circle of family and political allies fantastically rich through a system of kickbacks and cronyism, his opponents charge. Mr. Imamoglu, who is a potential presidential candidate for the opposition Republican People’s Party and is mindful of not alienating Erdogan supporters, has been cautious in revealing too much dirt about the previous mayoral administration or about the president himself. But Tarik Balyali, a member of the municipal assembly from the same opposition party, has been more outspoken.  As soon as the new mayor took office, Mr. Balyali, who serves on the inspection committee, went looking for answers in the municipality’s database. In particular he wanted to find an internal report on Istanbul’s spending on foundations and charitable organizations linked to Mr. Erdogan’s family, which governing party officials had denied existed. The report had been deleted from the database, but software engineers were able to retrieve it within a day, he said. “In the digital age nothing is secret,” he said. The municipality’s debt had increased fivefold in the last five years, Mr. Balyali said. Much of the increased spending occurred in the run-up to two election campaigns and was probably diverted to pay for the governing party’s election machine, he said.  Citing one example, he said that 185 million lira, or $31 million, had gone to a municipal gardening company two months before the 2018 presidential election.  “Clearly there was a need for flowers,” Mr. Balyali quipped.  “It was to finance the election campaign, propaganda, meetings and posters,” he added. “They had won elections in Istanbul for 20 years,” he said of Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party. “They thought they could do anything.” There was frequent overpricing of public contracts, Mr. Balyali said, adding, “Something that cost 10 lira was going for 100.” He described a contract in which the municipality agreed to pay more than the normal rate for 65,000 units of drinking water. “Where is that money going except into someone’s pockets,” Mr. Balyali said.  The true ownership of companies that won municipal contracts was often obscured behind a front person, sometimes the real owner’s neighbor or employee, he said. The really big money was in real estate and infrastructure development, and the members of the incoming administration found evidence of what they had suspected for years. Among the biggest prizes were an extension to Istanbul’s new airport, a high-speed rail link to the capital, Ankara, and Istanbul’s road and metro tunnels, each worth billions of dollars. Leaks of intercepted phone conversations published online in 2014 showed company bosses discussing the billions of dollars they were expecting in public contracts overseen by Mr. Erdogan and his transportation minister at the time, Binali Yildirim. In 2017, Istanbul awarded five contracts to build parts of the subway system. In total they were worth almost 1.2 billion lira, or $202 million, above what the municipality had estimated, Cigdem Toker, an investigative journalist, reported in a recent book.  The contracts were given to a handful of companies known to be close to Mr. Erdogan under a new regulation that effectively allowed for a closed process. Mr. Imamoglu said he was abandoning such practices, and has already saved money by canceling several expensive new projects that he said were unnecessary.  Among those are a solid waste plant, parking lots and a multibillion dollar tunnel along the European shore of the Bosporus, Mr. Balyali said. Yet Mr. Imamoglu’s hands are tied for many projects in which contracts are signed and work already begun, including several of the subway deals. For almost decade, Tayfun Kahraman headed the Istanbul Chamber of Urban Planners, a professional association, and he brought more than 100 court cases against the Istanbul municipality and its partners for projects that contravened the city’s building regulations. In September he joined the new mayor’s team.  The municipality was halting what it could, he said, including two road tunnel projects, and was considering using one for mass transit instead. As for the overpriced subway contracts, the city had no choice but to keep going, he said. Mr. Imamoglu announced that he had secured new financing in Europe and that work was restarting on three subway lines. The big battle on the horizon is Canal Istanbul, the proposed new shipping lane, Mr. Kahraman said. Mr. Erdogan has declared his determination to go ahead with the plan to respond to growing sea traffic from the Black Sea to the Marmara Sea. Mr. Kahraman criticized the plan on every level: social, environmental and financial.  He said he doubted that Mr. Erdogan could raise the billions needed to build the canal. But even if he could, Mr. Kahraman said, the projected costs of the canal would be enough to be used instead to make a third of Istanbul’s existing housing stock earthquake safe. He said municipal planning, which has been scrapped, showed extensive real-estate development along the route of the canal, suggesting to him that the project was predominantly a moneymaking endeavor. “You cannot bring Istanbul on this risky journey,” Mr. Imamoglu warned at the news briefing, “and a few people cannot bring things to this pass.”']",The declaration by the mayor was his first real challenge to the president and the powerful vested interests around him. 
Queen’s Christmas Message Acknowledges a ‘Bumpy’ Year for U.K.,2019-12-24,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II has had a trying year.  She will admit as much, it seems, in her annual, prerecorded message that will be broadcast on Christmas Day, when she will call 2019 “quite bumpy,” according to excerpts released on Tuesday by Buckingham Palace. Though it was not clear exactly what the queen was referring to, a quick overview of 2019 explains why it might have felt rough at times. In January, her husband, Prince Philip, apologized after he was involved in a car crash that left two women injured, setting off a public debate on older drivers. He agreed to relinquish his driver’s license. In August, the queen was dragged into British politics when Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked her to suspend Parliament, a move that was later ruled unlawful by the country’s Supreme Court.  A few weeks later, her grandson Prince Harry, and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, went public about their emotional struggles in a candid interview filmed during their official tour of Africa.  The couple’s environmental activism was questioned over their use of private jets, and Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William, were unable to shake off headlines of a rumored rift in their relationship.  But the biggest challenge for the royal family came in November, when Prince Andrew, the queen’s second-oldest son, stepped down from his public duties after he gave a catastrophic interview to the BBC about his relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.  “Quite bumpy” sounds less awful than “annus horribilis,” as the queen once called 1992 — the year when the marriages of three of her four children broke down, including that of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and fire damaged Windsor Castle.  But the queen’s description of 2019 makes clear that it has been tougher than 2018, which she characterized in last year’s Christmas broadcast simply as a “busy year.” The bumps of 2019 have continued into the final days of the year. After the queen recorded her message, Prince Philip, 98, was admitted to a London hospital for what Buckingham Palace described as a precautionary measure to treat a pre-existing condition. He left on Tuesday, after spending four nights there.  Though she is not expected to get into specifics in her address, the queen will focus on the importance of reconciliation — a notion that could apply both to her family and to Britain.  The country, which has just emerged from a general election, has been scarred by divisive politics surrounding the Brexit debate, including renewed calls for Scottish independence and concerns about weakened ties to Northern Ireland. The queen is to say that “small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held differences and deep-seated divisions to bring harmony and understanding,” according to a statement from the palace.  “The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of difference,” she is to add.  She is also to refer to the 75th anniversary of D-Day, which was commemorated in June by world leaders, including President Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, in a ceremony that the queen hosted in Portsmouth, a port city in southern England.  As head of state, the British monarch is expected to remain publicly neutral on political matters, and the queen’s addresses tend to be broad, anodyne and even a little opaque.  Her talk this year of reconciliation between wartime “sworn enemies” could be taken as advice to political parties and opponents in the Brexit fight, as well as nations. (Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, suggested this month that he did not usually watch the Christmas address.) “By being willing to put past differences behind us and move forward together, we honor the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost,” the queen is to say.  The BBC is scheduled to broadcast her Christmas address at 3 p.m. local time on Christmas Day.  It was filmed in the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, with the queen sitting at a desk decorated by family photographs, a picture released by the palace shows. Prince Harry, Meghan and their 7-month-old son, Archie, were nowhere to be seen — an absence that is sure to be parsed by the British tabloids, which are always eager to seize on a hint of dissension among the royals.  The couple will also be absent from the royal Christmas at Sandringham House, the queen’s country estate in Norfolk, England, as they are spending the holidays in Canada. They shared their Christmas card on social media on Tuesday.  Michael Wolgelenter contributed reporting.']","Queen Elizabeth II, whose public statements tend to avoid controversy or specifics, is expected to hint at the tumult for the royal family and the nation."
German Boy Missing Since 2017 Found in Child Pornography Raid,2019-12-24,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The German police, suspecting a 44-year-old man in the western city of Recklinghausen of disseminating child pornography, ordered a raid on his apartment. During their search, they opened a closet and found a teenage boy. “It was a 15-year-old who had been missing for a long time,” the police said Friday in a statement. According to posters and information that his mother, Manuela Bock, posted to her Facebook page, he had been gone for 922 days. Ms. Bock had been searching for him since June 2017, when he left a halfway house in Duisburg where he had been living and never returned. She tried to keep his name and image in the public eye, circulating missing persons posters and appearing on a local television show in search of public tips that might lead to his discovery. All that time, she said, she never gave up hope that her son was alive.  “For two and a half years I imagined what it would be like to see him again,” she told the weekly newspaper Bild am Sonntag in an interview published on Sunday. “But it wasn’t as I imagined. It was crazy! You can’t speak, you just want to take your child with you.” According to the authorities, her son had spent the entire time in the apartment of the suspect, whom they identified only as a 44-year-old German man. He was detained on Friday and was being held on suspicion of a severe sexual crime.  The case resembled two kidnappings in Austria more than a decade ago. One was that of Natascha Kampusch, an Austrian girl held in a windowless cellar for eight years before she escaped at age 18 in 2006. In the other case, two years later, it was discovered that Josef Fritzl had held his own daughter captive in his basement, where he raped her repeatedly, fathering seven children. She and her children escaped, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2009. Prosecutors in Bochum said Monday that the man in the German case, identified by the German news media as Lars H., was convicted of possessing child pornography last year and handed a 10-month suspended sentence.  The police said there was no indication the teenager had been bound or suffered any visible abuse. But Ms. Bock said she hardly recognized her son, who told her that he had not been outside since the day he disappeared. “I was shocked,” she said. “He seemed to me like a broken old man.”  He is now in the care of psychologists, who were assessing his condition. It was not clear when he would be allowed to return home. Before his disappearance, he had been in the halfway house because of behavioral issues related to the death of his father. “It is so difficult for me,” his mother told Bild. “We now need to take one step at a time. He needs to work through his experiences of the past two and a half years.” The authorities returned to the raided apartment on Saturday and confiscated cellphones, computer hard drives and other potential evidence. The home was filled with trash and smelled so strongly of urine that they wore protective masks, they said.  Ms. Bock said that when her son was found he was wearing the same clothes as the day he vanished two years ago, and that she wanted to give him some new clothes as he begins a new start. “I want to dress him up,” she said, “to celebrate a little Christmas with him.”']",The police in western Germany went to a man's home in search of child pornography but found a missing 15-year-old. 
"Japan Shrinks by 500,000 People as Births Fall to Lowest Number Since 1874",2019-12-24,By Ben Dooley,"['Japan has 512,000 fewer people this year than last, according to an estimate released on Tuesday by the country’s welfare ministry. That’s a drop of more than the entire population of the city of Atlanta.  The numbers are the latest sign of Japan’s increasing demographic challenges.  Births in the country — which are expected to drop below 900,000 this year — are at their lowest figure since 1874, when the population was about 70 percent smaller than its current 124 million.  The total number of deaths, on the other hand, is increasing. This year, the figure is expected to reach almost 1.4 million, the highest level since the end of World War II, a rise driven by the country’s increasingly elderly population. That gap between births and deaths has put Japan in a demographic squeeze. As the number of births goes down, there are fewer young people entering its work force. That means fewer people to replace retiring workers and support them as they age, a situation that poses a serious threat to Japan’s economic vitality and the security of its social safety net. Japan is not the only country having to cope with a shrinking society. It’s not even the country with the lowest birthrate: That title goes to South Korea. And other countries — including China and the United States — also face declining birthrates, which could spell trouble down the road. But Japan is the world’s grayest nation: Almost 28 percent of its residents are over 65.  Japan has had some time to address the effects of its declining population — the country has been consistently shrinking since 2007. That year, the country’s population dipped by around 18,000 people.  Since then, however, the losses have accelerated, crossing the half-million mark this year for the first time. Across the nation, whole villages are vanishing as young people choose not to have children or move to urban areas in search of better employment opportunities. And there is no end to the decline in sight. The government estimates that the population could shrink by around 16 million people — or nearly 13 percent — over the next 25 years. In response, Japan has made efforts to push up its fertility rate — the average number of births per woman — from its current level of around 1.4 to a target of 1.8, still short of the 2.1 considered necessary to hold the population steady.  The government has moved to encourage births by increasing incentives for parents to have more children and reducing obstacles that might discourage those who want to. But the incentives are proving insufficient as more people in Japan are putting off childbirth — or not having children at all — either to take advantage of economic opportunities or because they worry that economic opportunities do not exist and feel that they cannot afford children. Even for those who do want to be parents, the hurdles remain daunting.  Demand for day care in the country far outstrips supply, making it difficult for working women to juggle careers and children. And working men who want to take advantage of the country’s generous paternity leave can find themselves stigmatized by an entrenched cultural belief that a man’s place is in the office, not in the home. Adding to the government’s worries, marriage is on the decline. The number of marriages dropped by 3,000 year-on-year to 583,000, according to the data released on Tuesday, part of a steep decline over the last decade. As births continue to drop, Japan has tried to promote robots as a supplement for its shrinking work force.  It has also committed to accepting limited numbers of immigrants to handle vital work such as caring for the elderly. This year the country began issuing more than a quarter-million visas to immigrants who will do such work.']","A widening gap between births and deaths has put Japan in a demographic squeeze, with fewer people to replace retiring workers and support them as they age."
3 Family Members Drown in Swimming Pool Accident in Spain,2019-12-25,By Iliana Magra,"['Three members of a family vacationing in southern Spain drowned after becoming trapped in a swimming pool, prompting an investigation into a potential malfunction with a drainage mechanism that may have sucked them underwater, the authorities said on Wednesday. The tragedy unfolded when a 9-year-old girl began having difficulties in the pool. When her father jumped in to rescue her, he then became trapped, too. Another family member, a 16-year-old, then entered the water to help, but all three died, said Jorge Martín, a spokesman for the Civil Guard of Malaga Province, where the accident happened.  The father and daughter were British citizens and the teenager was American, the authorities said. No further details were given about them, though five members of the family were said to have arrived in the town of Mijas on Saturday. Accidents linked to faulty drainage or pumping systems in pools have happened before. In 2002, a 7-year-old girl from McLean, Va., drowned in a spa when she became entrapped by the powerful drag of a portal sucking water into a filtration system, and a man and three children died at a water park in Texas in 2004. The family vacationing in Mijas had apparently been sunbathing at an outdoor swimming pool at the Club La Costa World resort on Tuesday when the accident occurred, Mr. Martín said by telephone. The police are treating the deaths as an accident, Mr. Martín said, though they are still trying to determine what happened. “The question about why the girl, the father and the third member of the family had problems to get out of the swimming pool is being investigated,” he said, adding that officers were also awaiting autopsy results. Mr. Martín said that investigators were looking into whether “there were some problems with the engine of the swimming pool” and whether there was a problem with the suction mechanism of the pool’s drain.  “All at Club La Costa World resort are devastated by the tragedy,” the company that owns the resort, CLC World Resorts and Hotels, said in a statement. Club La Costa World was “assisting the authorities fully,” it said. Late Wednesday, the company said that investigators had already concluded that there was no problem with the pool’s systems, but the authorities said they had yet to reach such a finding. A worker at the resort, responding to other vacationers’ cries for help, jumped into the pool to help the family members but was too late, Mr. Martín said.  Although the worker managed to retrieve the bodies, he also reported difficulties in getting out of the pool, describing the effect as being “like swimming in a wild river,” according to Mr. Martín.

"China’s Seniors, Looking for Love, Head to the Park",2019-12-24,By Sui-Lee Wee,"['BEIJING — Zhao Lin had become accustomed to the single life. But his days and nights were growing lonely, and he decided it was time to find Ms. Right. That’s how the 78-year-old ended up at the park. “I have been looking for more than a year,” said Mr. Zhao, a fixture at one of the dozens of senior singles scenes popping up in public parks around China. So far, he admits, the pickings have been slim.  “It’s usually one conversation and that’s it,” said Mr. Zhao, a widower since 1971, in a lament familiar to frustrated singles no matter their age. “There’s no second time. They’ll let you down and there’s no hope. So what’s the point?”  Three decades of economic growth and social change have transformed attitudes of love and sex among China’s elderly. Increasingly single and assertive, the country’s lonely seniors are on the market.  In Chinese media, the phenomenon has been labeled “twilight love.” Contestants well into their later years now make regular appearances on Chinese dating shows with names like “Peach Blossoms Bloom,” “Exciting Old Friends” and “Holding Hands.” Online chat rooms have emerged for older singles.  But in China, none of those venues holds the same appeal as the local park.  In Beijing, the elderly have picked Changpuhe and the Temple of Heaven. The southwestern municipality of Chongqing has a “matchmaking corner” in Hongyadong Park. In the northern city of Xian, elderly residents gather every Wednesday and Saturday at Revolution Park. “My American colleagues, when they go to China, they are amazed at how many people are socializing in a park,” said Bei Wu, director of global health and aging research at New York University, who has studied China’s elderly for 30 years. “It’s a practical way for a group gathering,” Dr. Wu said. “In the park, you can increase the chance of having successful blind dates.” Demographics is behind it all.  An aging population means more people are outliving their spouses. The number of widows and widowers totals nearly 48 million, according to a study by the government research group Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The group projects that number will rise to 118.4 million by 2050.  And four out of five widows and widowers want to remarry, according to the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, citing a survey by Chinese Academy of Sciences.  Others are choosing to leave their spouses. In Beijing, nearly one-third of divorce cases were filed by people aged 60 to 70, according to the Beijing Evening News.  The growing population of elderly singles has public health implications. H.I.V. infection rates are rising among elderly Chinese because many do not practice safe sex, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Cases among Chinese men aged 60 and older have nearly tripled since 2012, it said. In October, the central government announced separate policy measures for the elderly to strengthen AIDS prevention education. That lack of knowledge is understandable. When China’s elders were young, talking about sex was taboo. People met their prospective spouses through friends or matchmakers. Dating was almost unheard-of.  In China’s parks, that can make for awkward scenes. On a recent Tuesday in Changpuhe, a strip of greenery next to the Forbidden City, elderly men clustered together, scoping out the women and men milling around like wallflowers. Several of them strolled up and down, waiting to make eye contact with women. An elderly man sat next to a woman in a purple jacket for a few minutes. Then, he leaned in to ask: “How old are you?” “Seventy-two,” she answered in a soft voice. Minutes later, they struck up a conversation. Many complained of some unique, only-in-China criteria for finding a mate. Pensions and health insurance can enhance attractiveness, for example, in a country where getting cancer can lead to bankruptcy. The widowed were more desirable than the divorced, said some. Less emotional baggage, they explained. “Looking For A Soulmate,” read a wrinkled brown sheet of paper stuck on a rock under the trees, one of several ads placed around the park. “Male. Born in 1949. Divorced. No responsibilities.” The sign was written by a Mr. Li, whose wish list for a wife was that she be roughly 5 feet tall, weigh between 130 to 150 pounds, be between 50 to 60 years old and have unblemished skin. “No black moles,” it warned.  In return, Mr. Li promised to bequeath his 1,100-square-foot apartment to any woman “willing to accompany me till the end of my life.” Another advertisement placed by a male suitor pledged a life of travel and a commitment to buy property in the southeast coast of China, the United States and Japan.  Guan Yongnian, an 82-year-old divorced man, sees himself as a catch. He is healthy and successful, a calligraphy expert, a writer and a teacher of tai chi, a gentle form of martial arts popular in China.  Mr. Guan said that in the past 30 years, friends have tried to introduce other women to him. He married in his 20s, and has two daughters in their 50s, and a son, who is nearly 60. Mr. Guan’s list of requirements for his future wife: ideally in her 40s — yes, half his age — hygienic, smart, capable and “not unreasonable.” Other pluses: if she could “bring spiritual relief and happiness.” But Mr. Guan’s expectations were low. “Nowadays, many people are not hygienic, dress poorly and are not imbued with sophistication and good breeding,” he sniffed.  He had scanned the crowd for close to an hour and was not planning on making the first move. “I have a problem: When you call me, I don’t call back,” said Mr. Guan, who was dressed in a brown trench coat. “I’m pretty unreasonable. You have to chase me.”  A woman wearing pink lipstick and dressed in a yellow coat lingered in front of Mr. Guan, curious at the sight of him being interviewed. “How old are you now? 50s? 60s?” Mr. Guan asked. “60s,” she giggled. “See?” he said. “I guessed right.” The woman was Han Shuping. She was actually 52. Divorced, she had been coming to Changpuhe for two years. A man flicked her hair before she playfully swatted him away. “Most of the characters here are pretty bad,” Ms. Han said. “The old men would ask you out for a meal, invite you back to their place and try to get you in bed.” Originally from central Henan Province, Ms. Han said she was honest with prospective suitors, telling them she is from the countryside and has no pension. Ms. Han said she wanted to “find someone who I can chat with and then develop feelings for.”  “At this stage, love at first sight is impossible,” she said. She was pessimistic about her prospects. “It is very hard to find someone here,” Ms. Han said. “The genuine ones are few and far between.” Mr. Zhao, the 78-year-old widower, agreed. He bemoaned the directness of some of the women.  “They want a house, car and money,” said Mr. Zhao, who was tall, bespectacled and stylishly dressed in a beige pageboy cap. “They ask you directly to change the names in the property deed. It’s the first thing they say. Isn’t that terrifying?” But he still longed for a mate to ward off his loneliness. “It gets miserable,” he said.  Mr. Zhao talked about “three treasures in this life” — to have someone know when “you’re cold or warm, in pain or in despair.” “If you’ve never experienced these three big treasures, how can you understand what is bliss? What is pain?” Mr. Zhao said. “This is what I’m feeling right now. But I never used to feel like that.” Elsie Chen contributed research.']","Increasingly widowed and divorced, a new generation of graying singles are navigating modern romance in a rapidly changing country."
Saudi Death Sentences in Khashoggi Killing Fail to Dispel Questions,2019-12-23,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia sentenced five men to death and three to prison terms over the killing of the Saudi dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, a ruling widely dismissed as punishing low-level agents while protecting their leaders.  The sentences, announced by a government spokesman on Monday, reflected the Saudi argument that the killing was not ordered by the royal court, but was instead a last-minute decision by agents on the ground — a narrative that contradicts ample indications that the agents arrived in Istanbul last year with an intent to kill and the tools to do so. While subject to appeal, the verdicts also raised the possibility that Saudi Arabia could behead the men who carried out the killing while shielding those who ordered it. The kingdom has denied any involvement by its crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and his top aides, who foreign analysts say were probably behind the killing. A United Nations expert who investigated the killing dismissed the verdicts as “a mockery.” The death of Mr. Khashoggi, 59, a veteran Saudi journalist who fled the kingdom and wrote columns for The Washington Post, caused international outrage and battered the image of Prince Mohammed as a young ruler working to open up his kingdom’s economy and society. It also caused widespread anger in Washington among diplomats, lawmakers and intelligence officials who saw the killing as an inexcusable act by a longtime American partner. But President Trump has defended Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed throughout, lauding them as key allies of the United States and loyal buyers of American weapons. The sentences appeared unlikely to change those views. The White House did not comment on the sentences on Monday.  Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said they were part of a Saudi effort to distance the Saudi leadership from the killing. “The suggestion that this was a rogue operation or a snap decision is contradicted by the evidence and common sense,” Mr. Schiff said in a statement. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island echoed an earlier assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency that Prince Mohammed had likely ordered the killing. “It is inconceivable that such activities would be conducted without the direction or blessing of the crown prince given that he effectively controls all levers of power in Saudi Arabia,” Mr. Reed said in a statement. The kingdom’s handling of the case has raised further concerns. Turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of impeding the investigation, and a United Nations investigator said the kingdom’s actions could amount to obstruction of justice. The trial, held in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, was shrouded in secrecy. The kingdom did not reveal the suspects’ names, and foreign diplomats who attended sessions of the trial were sworn to silence. Adam Coogle, who researches Saudi Arabia for Human Rights Watch, said that the opaque trial and the kingdom’s overall treatment of the case showed the need for an independent investigation. “Saudi Arabia’s absolution of its senior leadership of any culpability in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi raises serious concerns over the fairness of the criminal proceedings,” he said. “Saudi Arabia’s handling of the murder, from complete denial to hanging the murder on lower-level operatives in a trial that lacked transparency, demonstrates the need for an independent criminal inquiry.” Mr. Khashoggi, who lived in Virginia, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to obtain paperwork he needed to marry his Turkish fiancée. Inside, he was confronted by Saudi agents, who killed him and dismembered his body. His remains have yet to be found. On Monday, a spokesman for the kingdom’s public prosecutor told reporters in Riyadh that no evidence had been found that the killing had been planned ahead of time. Instead, he said, agents had been sent to Istanbul to “negotiate” with Mr. Khashoggi and decided to kill him after that effort failed. But investigations by the Turkish authorities and a United Nations expert found vast evidence of premeditation, such as the arrival of 15 Saudi agents in Istanbul in the hours before Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. They included a body double who sought to leave a false trail of surveillance video indicating that Mr. Khashoggi was still alive, and a forensic doctor who the Turks say arrived with a bone saw that was used to dismember Mr. Khashoggi’s body. Recordings captured by Turkish intelligence inside the consulate before, during and after the killing, and shared with the United Nations investigator, revealed the agents discussing how to fit Mr. Khashoggi’s body into suitcases. When Mr. Khashoggi reached the consulate, one of the agents referred to him as the “sacrificial animal.” After his death, no effort was made to resuscitate him.  The United Nations investigator also reported a vast effort by Saudi officials to cover up the killing, including by forensically cleansing the crime scene before allowing Turkish investigators access to it. On Twitter, Fahrettin Altun, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, wrote that the leaders who had ordered the operation had been “granted immunity.” “To claim that a handful of intelligence operatives committed this murder is to mock the world’s intelligence — to say the least,” he wrote. Although no evidence has been made public that directly implicates Prince Mohammed in the killing, an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency found that he had probably ordered the operation, which employed two private jets, two diplomatic facilities and the team of agents. Prince Mohammed has said that he played no role in the killing but that he bore some responsibility for it because it happened on his watch. An investigation by Agnès Callamard, the special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions for the United Nations human rights agency, concluded that there was “credible evidence, warranting further investigation, of high-level Saudi officials’ individual liability, including the crown prince’s.” On Monday, Ms. Callamard criticized the verdicts, saying on Twitter that the prosecutor had ignored evidence of premeditation and did not treat the killing as sanctioned by the state, which required holding top officials accountable.  “Bottom line: the hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death,” she wrote. “The masterminds not only walk free. They have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial. That is the antithesis of justice. It is a mockery.” The Saudi public prosecutor’s office said Monday that it had examined 31 suspects and arrested 21 of them. Of those, 11 were put on trial. Five men were sentenced to death for their direct involvement in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Three others were given a total of 24 years in prison for covering up the crime and violating other laws. On Twitter, one of Mr. Khashoggi’s adult children, Salah Khashoggi, who lives in Saudi Arabia, praised the Saudi judges as fair. “We confirm our faith in the Saudi judiciary at all levels and in its giving us justice and ensuring fairness,” he wrote. Months after the killing, he and Mr. Khashoggi’s other children received tens of thousands of dollars and millions in real estate from the government to compensate for their father’s murder. Turkish officials have identified the men they believe were inside the consulate when Mr. Khashoggi was killed, but it was unclear if they were the same men sentenced on Monday because the Saudis did not release their names. The kingdom did, however, identify three suspects who were not sentenced.  Ahmed Asseri, the deputy head of Saudi intelligence, who Saudi officials initially said had overseen the operation, was released without charge. Mohammed al-Otaibi, the Saudi consul in Istanbul who gave reporters a tour of the consulate days after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, was also released.  And Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Prince Mohammed, was not put on trial because the prosecutor’s office said there was a lack of evidence against him. The exonerations of Mr. al-Otaibi and Mr. al-Qahtani are likely to rankle the United States, which imposed sanctions on them for their roles in the killing. On Monday, Saudi Twitter accounts published what appeared to be coordinated posts voicing the Saudi people’s trust in Mr. Asseri and Mr. al-Qahtani. The sentences announced Monday were preliminary and are subject to appeal. Death sentences in Saudi Arabia are usually carried out by beheading in public squares.

Iraq’s New Election Law Draws Much Criticism and Few Cheers,2019-12-25,By Falih Hassan and Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — The Iraqi Parliament made good on its promise to overhaul the country’s election laws, voting on Tuesday to make sweeping changes in how lawmakers are elected, seemingly in response to demands from protesters to give citizens a greater voice.  The law does away with voting for lists of candidates grouped by party and replaces it with voting for individuals, which would seem to lessen the influence of political parties seen by protesters as corrupt.  But within hours of its passage, criticism began to roll in from legal experts, intellectuals and the Iraqi street suggesting that the law might not work as advertised.  By midnight a banner was flying in Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the protests, saying, “Let them not cheat you: The election law does not represent us.”  Legislators defended the new law, insisting that they were heeding the will of the protesters.  “The political blocs listened to the demands of the demonstrators and carried out a peaceful coup upon themselves by passing the election law,” said Wajih Abbas, a lawmaker from Sadiqoon, the party led by Qais al-Khazali, who is viewed as close to Iran.  The populist political and religious leader Muqtada al-Sadr, whose political bloc is one of Iraq’s largest, tweeted support for the law, describing it as a “first step on the path of reforms.”  Tens of thousands of his followers have been in the streets for months, pushing for many of the changes the new law purports to include. But already, doubts have emerged over how the law will be put into practice. Abbas Kadhim, the director of the Iraq Initiative and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the measure had created something “similar to a congressional system, but Iraq’s system is parliamentary.”  “It is like having a Volkswagen bug and deciding it needs a new engine and you get the best — an engine for a Ferrari — but the two don’t work together,” said Mr. Kadhim, a longtime observer of the Iraqi political system.  The new law would divide Iraq into districts, with a member of Parliament elected from each. It is not clear how many people will be in each district — and there has not been a census in more than 20 years, so no one really knows how many people live in any given area.  Perhaps the bigger issue is that once representatives get to Parliament, according to the Iraqi Constitution, they will have to form political parties in order to choose a prime minister.  What could easily happen, Mr. Kadhim said, is that the parties will send representatives to run as individuals in districts around Iraq, injecting money and other support into the campaigns as needed. The parliamentary blocs will simply regroup once the elections are over.  “Then it will go back to the status quo,” Mr. Kadhim said.  The status quo is exactly what drew demonstrators into the streets in October when they first gathered to protest a lack of jobs and services, and the failure of Parliament to respond to Iraqi citizens.  After the government opened fire on demonstrators, killing more than 100 people in the first five days of protests, the number of people taking to the streets multiplied. They also began to agitate for more far-reaching changes that would rid the system of the political parties that many see as the cause of government corruption.  Many of those parties are also close to Iran or indebted to it for support. For the protesters, reducing Iran’s influence and holding early elections have become a rallying cry. More than 500 people have been killed during the three months of protests, and about 19,000 have been wounded.  Early elections look unlikely, however, because the law is silent on how electoral districts will be formed or who will designate them. Figuring out how that will work could take months or longer, said Tariq Harb, an expert on the Iraqi Constitution and legal system. “The technical complications related to identifying new districts, thousands of them across the country, means there will not be early elections,” Mr. Harb said.   ']","Iraq’s Parliament voted to overhaul the country’s election laws in a bid to reduce the power of political parties. But many protesters, who had called for just such a change, were not impressed.

"As Rail Strike Upends Holiday Plans in France, a Fight Over Blame",2019-12-23,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['PARIS — There was just one day left before Christmas Eve, and the mood inside the Gare de Lyon train station in Paris on Monday was tense.  Travelers, many with shopping bags laden with gifts, were waiting for trains that might never come. Striking rail workers suddenly marched into the station, chanting noisily, followed a few minutes later by scores of police officers in riot gear. “Usually, 15 of us get together for Christmas, but this year it’s just going to be my wife and me,” said Florian Cercea, 28, whose train had been delayed by several hours. “Christmas comes only once a year, and it’s very important for my family.” He added: “It’s going to be a sad Christmas. It means, even if we have presents, we can’t give them to the children. I guess we’ll give them next year after the strike is over.” Exactly when the strike — over the government’s push to overhaul the nation’s generous pension system — might end remains up in the air. Despite President Emmanuel Macron’s call for a “truce"" during the holidays, the three-week general strike that has crippled transportation in France and already hurt its economy has now upended people’s plans. In the final countdown to Christmas, the work stoppage was jeopardizing traditional family gatherings and meals of roasted capon for travelers in the Gare de Lyon and elsewhere across France. “Because of the strike, I might end up with no holiday or meal,” said Michel Esmingeot, 65, who had walked five miles to the station only to find that his train was delayed by several hours. “I’m not even sure there is a train. I’ll sleep in the train station if I have to and try again tomorrow. I don’t want to end up alone on Christmas.” Late last week, government officials and labor union leaders failed to reach an agreement to end one of the biggest general strikes in decades. Since Dec. 5, it has shut down most of Paris’s public transportation network, forcing thousands to squeeze into the few running trains, or to commute by bike and scooter or on foot. Transportation workers have taken the lead against the government’s plans to eliminate special retirement plans and create a universal points-based system, as part of an effort to encourage the French to work longer.  After meeting with the government last week, Philippe Martinez, the head of the General Confederation of Labor, one of the largest unions opposed to the changes, gave no indication of backing down and demanded the withdrawal of the government’s plans. “We haven’t changed course,” Mr. Martinez said. Union leaders have scheduled a national day of strike on Jan. 9. But some labor officials said it was necessary to keep up the pressure during the holidays. On Monday, hundreds of strikers protested near the Gare de Lyon, and some set off smoke bombs inside the metro station and clashed with the riot police. Despite the inconvenience, the majority of the French population remained behind the strikers, though the level of support has dipped a couple of percentage points. According to a poll published Sunday in Le Journal du Dimanche, 51 percent backed the strike and 34 percent were opposed, with the rest expressing no opinion. In a continuing battle over public opinion, both the government and the unions have tried to capitalize on the public’s frustrations over the holiday disruptions. Over the weekend, the national railway company and the unions pointed fingers at each other when rail officials announced the cancellation of a service allowing children to travel alone on certain trains. Company officials said that a lack of personnel because of the strike had given them no choice. Union officials said that workers accompanying the children were contractors who were not on strike, and accused company officials of “using children and their families to try to discredit” the strikers. The Christmas plans of at least 5,000 children were at stake. The railroad company eventually announced that it had secured 14 TGV trains to transport the children from Paris to Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux and other cities. Mr. Macron, who was in Ivory Coast over the weekend as part of a visit to West Africa, tried to take credit. “Solutions were found in response to our demands, in particular for the young children traveling alone,” Mr. Macron said at a news conference in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s economic capital. Mr. Macron said the Constitution allowed the unions to strike. “But I believe that there are moments in the life of a nation when it’s also good to know how to call a truce to respect families and the lives of families,” he said, adding that respect was due those who “were separated and want to get together during the holidays.” On Monday, only two of five TGV trains were operating, with regional express trains also having limited service. At the Gare de Lyon train station, many travelers were unsure whether they would make it to their final destinations. “It’s already a miracle that I was able to come here this morning,” said Samir Abdou-Eid, 68, who had managed to squeeze into a crowded commuter train from a suburb to the station, but arrived to find that his morning train to Montargis, about two hours southeast of Paris, had been canceled. He was not sure whether there was another train for him. “I’ll sleep tonight in the station if I have to,” said Mr. Abdou-Eid, a bag filled with chocolates and a cuddly toy rabbit and bear for his grandchildren at his feet. “I want to spend Christmas with them.”  Asked about the strikers, Mr. Abdou-Eid held his nose and said, “No comment.” Others expressed support for the strikers even though their holidays had been severely affected. The strike had wreaked havoc with Eric and Yolaine Ramond’s plans to travel six days earlier, forcing them to adjust twice.  On Monday, they were finally able to take a TGV from their home in Valenciennes, in the north of France, to Paris, where they were hoping to catch a train south for a family gathering. “We’re just a week late,” Mr. Ramond, 58, said, adding, however, that he fully supported the transportation strikers. “The government is trying to rob them of something,” he said, referring to a special pension plan enjoyed by some transportation workers. “So they have to show that they’re not sheep. Of course, it’s inconveniencing us, but I support their right to strike.” “It’s the only way for them to be heard,"" Ms. Ramond, 57, said, though she added that she had been “frustrated” by the six-day delay. “I was fine,"" her husband said. “As long as we get there, it’s fine — but not after the holidays.”']","With no Christmas truce in the long strike, many travelers can’t get to family gatherings, and the government and unions are pointing fingers at each other."
"Australia’s Volunteer Firefighters Find It Hard to Pause, Even for Christmas",2019-12-24,"By Isabella Kwai, Livia Albeck-Ripka and Matthew Abbott","['SYDNEY, Australia — Lucy Baranowski, a volunteer firefighter, has taken time off work over the past three weeks to battle one of the biggest blazes ever recorded in Australia. The smoke has given her a cough. She and her husband, also a firefighter, are tired to the bone. Friends had to step in to ensure that Santa would visit her four children.  “We hadn’t had time to do Christmas shopping or Santa photos,” she said. “It’s like running a marathon for however many weeks straight.” One of the worst early fire seasons in Australia’s history has left 10 people dead, destroyed nearly 1,000 properties and consumed millions of acres. To confront the danger and protect communities, the country has relied on its overwhelmingly volunteer firefighting force. The volunteers, some of whom have been working more than 12-hour shifts as they drain annual leave from their jobs, say they are getting by through a combination of adrenaline and a sense of duty to their neighbors. But as the physical and emotional toll on the thousands of unpaid firefighters mounts, Australia is facing questions about whether it can continue to rely on a volunteer force as climate change contributes to an ever-lengthening fire season. In the United States, most population centers are protected by career firefighters, though volunteers, most of whom are in rural areas, make up about 65 percent of the overall firefighting force.  In Australia, as calls have grown for the country to begin compensating firefighters, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that doing so is not an immediate goal, and that fire chiefs have not asked for the change. He noted that Australia relied on volunteers for many crucial services, including lifeguards at beaches. Sandra Lunardi, the acting chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council, which coordinates firefighting efforts, said it would be difficult to institute a compensation system.  “To pay firefighters to be present in the numbers necessary and in the places necessary to give quick response to bush fires” in rural Australia was “a significant challenge, particularly when these fires are prolonged and frequent,” Ms. Lunardi wrote by email.  But members of the Fire Brigade Employees Union, which represents firefighters in Australia, said at a news conference last week that it was “bewildering” that the government expected volunteer firefighters to work for months on end without compensation.  As they do so, the firefighters are risking their lives in the face of blazes that are growing larger and more intense as the country gets hotter and drier. That danger was tragically illustrated last week when two firefighters battling a blaze in a town southwest of Sydney were killed when their truck rolled over.  David Smart, captain of the volunteer firefighters in the Kangaroo Valley, 100 miles south of Sydney, said that his brigade was taking steps to manage the increased demands. The firefighters were cycling shifts to try to avoid fatigue, he said, but the long days still wore on them. And then there is the emotional trauma of seeing houses and bush land destroyed, he added.  “I think everyone is very stressed,” he said. “People are tired. It’s been going for weeks on end.”  The burdens that fell on volunteer firefighters were lighter in the past, many said. In previous years, fires were more spread out through the year, said Brad Kelly, deputy captain of the Ingleside Fire Brigade, north of Sydney, which tackled a blaze on Monday.  “They weren’t just one big continuous line of activity through that whole time,” he said.  On a recent shift, firefighters did not return home until 4 a.m. “If a house is being impacted, you’re not going to walk away from it,” Mr. Kelly said. Ms. Baranowski, who comes from a family of firefighters, said, “We do it because we need to do it.”  But taking time off to fight the blazes has strained her family financially, she said. They have managed only with the help of their local community northwest of Sydney, which has donated presents and helped with groceries and chores in the house. That community spirit was especially apparent after the two firefighters were killed last Thursday. Both left behind young children, and an online fund-raising page for their families has raised more than $230,000, or nearly 350,000 Australian dollars.  In Balmoral, a village southwest of Sydney where fires destroyed homes on Saturday, donations to the rural fire service filled the station and brought some firefighters to tears.  “I haven’t even gone Christmas shopping or anything for my daughter,” a visibly moved Andrew Johnstone said in an interview with Nine News. “We just tried so hard to save some people’s homes and everything.” On Tuesday, Mr. Morrison, the prime minister, who has been criticized for his government’s response to climate change as well as for his decision to take a vacation to Hawaii as the fires raged, announced that volunteer firefighters who were also federal government employees would get four weeks of paid leave to fight the fires.  “Today’s announcement is about ensuring our volunteer firefighters can keep focused on the job at hand,” he said in a statement. He acknowledged, though, that the measure would do little to benefit volunteers who were self-employed or who worked in the private sector.  The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, welcomed the move but said it did not go far enough. He has called for the government to find ways to compensate the firefighters, perhaps through tax measures or one-time payments. Compensated or not, firefighters said they were prepared to jump back into action even as conditions were expected to improve over Christmas, with some rain and lower temperatures. “Fire doesn’t stop,” Mr. Kelly of the Ingleside Fire Brigade said. “Work still needs to be done.” Isabella Kwai reported from Sydney, Australia, and Livia Albeck-Ripka from Melbourne.']","Thousands are working extended shifts to battle relentless blazes, raising questions about whether the country can continue to rely on an unpaid force."
"He Vowed to Revitalize Italy’s Schools. After a Budget Loss, He’s Out.",2019-12-26,By Anna Momigliano,"['ROME — Italy’s education minister, who had vowed to revitalize the country’s schools and introduce lessons on climate change in every grade nationwide, has resigned, citing a lack of funding. The minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, submitted his resignation on Monday after Parliament ratified a 2020 budget that fell a billion euros short of his request. The resignation was disclosed publicly on Wednesday. Mr. Fioramonti, appointed in September, had announced ambitious plans to teach students about the climate and environmental sustainability, beginning next fall. “The 21st century citizen,” he said, “must be a sustainable citizen.”  But his resignation this week didn’t come as a surprise. In an interview with the newspaper Il Messaggero last month, Mr. Fioramonti said he was seeking an additional 3 billion euros for the education budget and would quit if the request wasn’t met. The budget approved by Parliament added €2 billion, according to the economy minister, Roberto Gualtieri. Italy has one of the lowest spending rates for education among developed countries, dedicating 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product to schools and universities. Standardized test scores released this month showed Italy’s schoolchildren lagging behind their peers in most Western European nations. Mr. Fioramonti, an author and academic, was elected to Parliament in 2018 as part of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. He joined the cabinet this fall when Five Star, which had previously governed with the right-wing League, formed a new coalition with the center-left Democratic Party.  It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mr. Fioramonti’s resignation would affect plans to expand lessons on climate change, although Five Star has promoted the protection and study of the environment. His “irrevocable resignation,” tendered to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, is a blow to the governing alliance but is not likely to have wide political ramifications. Mr. Fioramonti is expected to leave Five Star and form an independent party that would still support the Conte-led government, the newspaper Repubblica reported.

Nigeria Releases Leading Critic on Bail After a Campaign an Ocean Away,2019-12-25,By Ruth Maclean,"['A Nigerian publisher and former presidential candidate was released on bail on Tuesday after a monthslong imprisonment that heightened fears of deteriorating protections for free expression in Africa’s most populous nation. Omoyele Sowore, the founder of the website Sahara Reporters, had been held for most of the past five months by Nigeria’s equivalent of the Secret Service, the Department for State Services. Two earlier court orders to release Mr. Sowore on bail had been ignored by the authorities. At a court appearance on Dec. 6, Mr. Sowore, then temporarily free, was wrestled to the floor of a courtroom and taken into custody, an incident that stirred outrage when it was circulated on social media.  Mr. Sowore still faces trial on charges of treason, money laundering and “cyberstalking” — the last for allegedly insulting the president, Muhammadu Buhari, on television. His bail conditions stipulate that he may not leave the Nigerian capital, Abuja, or speak to the press, but that did not stop him from giving a short statement after his release. Six members of the United States Congress had appealed to the Nigerian attorney general on behalf of Mr. Sowore, who lives in New Jersey with his wife and children but whose work focuses on exposing corruption and government malfeasance in Nigeria. His wife, Opeyemi Sowore, said that she was grateful for his release, but that her family was still praying for the “holiday miracle” of his return home to Haworth, N.J., where the family’s neighbors have campaigned for the Nigerian authorities to free him. “My No. 1 concern is for his safety,” Ms. Sowore said. “We remain resolute on Yele being cleared of all baseless charges,” she added, using the short form of Omoyele Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey said that he was gratified to hear of Mr. Sowore’s release, but that he and Representative Josh Gottheimer, also of New Jersey, would watch Mr. Sowore’s case closely. “I expect the government of Nigeria to ensure his continued safety and security now that he is out of custody,” Senator Menendez said.  Mr. Gottheimer added: “We will not stop working until Yele comes home.”  Mr. Sowore was once seen as supportive of Mr. Buhari, but he came to be one of the administration’s fiercest critics. In February, Mr. Buhari was elected to a second term in an election in which Mr. Sowore ran unsuccessfully against him. Mr. Sowore was arrested on Aug. 3, on one of his frequent trips to his native country, when he was about to lead a protest against the government with the social media tagline #RevolutionNow. His critics accuse him of trying to overthrow the Nigerian government rather than, as his supporters claim, merely pointing out government corruption and wrongdoing.']","Omoyele Sowore, a publisher and ex-presidential candidate, was released after months in detention.

‘We’d Prefer the Food’: Zimbabwe Fears a Famine Is in Its Future,2019-12-25,By Jeffrey Moyo and Rick Gladstone,"['HARARE, Zimbabwe — The people lined up early for a chance to buy subsidized maize meal from the government-run Grain Marketing Board depot in Harare, at prices they could afford. After three hours, a guard emerged to announce that the depot’s supply was rotten so there would be none for sale that day. The crowd of 150 reacted with disbelief and anger.  “Life is hard, all things are expensive, there are no price controls and inflation just keeps getting worse,” said Benjamini Dunha, 57, a plumber who makes 700 Zimbabwe dollars a month — about $38 at official exchange rates. Less than a year ago, his salary was worth much closer to $700.  Another shopper, Nyasha Domboka, 52, spoke cynically about a truckful of maize meal, also known as mealie meal, that he had just seen in the depot parking lot. “How can mealie-meal packed just recently be said to have gone bad all of a sudden?” he asked. A combination of government dysfunction, an economic meltdown, droughts and a calamitous cyclone this past March have hurtled Zimbabwe toward a hunger disaster that has become the most severe in southern Africa and among the most alarming in the world. While food is not necessarily scarce yet, it is becoming unaffordable for all but the privileged few.  “I cannot stress enough the urgency of the situation in Zimbabwe,” Hilal Elver, an independent United Nations human rights expert on food security, said after a 10-day visit in November. Sixty percent of the country’s 14 million people, Ms. Elver said, are “food-insecure, living in a household that is unable to obtain enough food to meet basic needs.” Hunger in Africa is a pervasive problem, but in Zimbabwe, once known as the continent’s breadbasket, it has been compounded by dysfunction that has left the country in its most serious economic crisis in a decade. The annual inflation rate, which the International Monetary Fund has called the world’s highest, is 300 percent.  Maize meal, a staple of the Zimbabwean diet, doubled in price in November to 101 Zimbabwe dollars per 10-kilogram sack. Now it costs 117. In early December, a two-liter bottle of cooking oil cost 59 Zimbabwe dollars. Now it costs more than 72. “The money here is valueless now,” said Mr. Dunha, who has eight children. All they can afford to eat, he said, are vegetables and sadza, a thick porridge of boiled maize meal. Gerald Bourke, a spokesman for the southern Africa operations of the World Food Program, the anti-hunger agency of the United Nations, said that until recently 60 percent of its assistance to Zimbabweans was in the form of cash, but that the recipients no longer wanted the money.  “Inflation is a rampant problem and people said, ‘We’d prefer the food,’” Mr. Bourke said. So by January, he said, the agency intends to switch to a “fully in-kind food program” for the first time in Zimbabwe, distributing monthly rations of grain, oil and nutritional supplements for children younger than 5. The agency also will double the number of recipients to four million. “This is certainly the worst we are seeing in southern Africa,” Mr. Bourke said during a mid-December field visit to Harare, the capital. While cases of acute hunger have not been uncommon in rural Zimbabwe, “it’s seen in the cities now,” he said. “Hungry people in the countryside are moving to the cities” in search of food.  The finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, said on Friday that the government would spend 180 million Zimbabwe dollars a month on subsidies as part of an effort to keep the price of maize meal stable.  But for many Zimbabweans, there is fear that the inflation problem portends a return to the days more than a decade ago when a trip to buy groceries required wheelbarrows of cash. Even now, purchases of anything beyond maize meal is considered a luxury.  “We used to buy favorite foods such as ice cream, cheese, bacon, sausages and ham, and prepare good breakfasts for our families, “ said Moreblessing Nyambara, a 35-year-old Harare schoolteacher. “These things are a vision of the past now.” Many historians attribute Zimbabwe’s predicament to the legacy of Robert Mugabe, the father of independence in 1980. An icon of African anti-colonialism, Mr. Mugabe became a despot and presided over the decline of what had been one of Africa’s most prosperous lands. He was ousted in 2017, and died in September at age 95. Any hopes that Mr. Mugabe’s former ally and successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, could revive Zimbabwe’s economy have almost completely faded.  This past June Mr. Mnangagwa scrapped a policy known as dollarization, in which the United States dollar and other foreign currencies were used as legal tender. That policy was introduced in 2009 and helped end an era of hyperinflation, which had rendered the Zimbabwe dollar less valuable than the paper it was printed on. But a newly introduced version of the Zimbabwe dollar has plunged in value, drastically raising the prices of goods priced in the currency.  Foreigners are reluctant to invest in Zimbabwe despite Mr. Mnangagwa’s proclamation that the country is “open for business.” Export sales and remittances from the Zimbabwean diaspora, important sources of United States dollars needed to import food and fuel, have fallen.  Mr. Mnangagwa has rejected calls to restore dollarization.  “No progressive nation can progress without its own currency,” he told members of the governing ZANU-PF party at their annual conference in mid-December. “We will not revert back.”  Still, for now, the inflation problem remains less severe than what prevailed more than a decade ago.  At that time, prices were doubling every day, reaching a point where a single sheet of two-ply toilet paper cost nearly as much as a 500-Zimbabwe-dollar bill, then the smallest in circulation. That comparison spawned grim jokes about a better use for the currency.  Four million Zimbabweans are now not that far away from famine, according to a scale commonly used internationally to classify the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition. In the scale’s five phases, Phase 1 is minimal and Phase 5 is famine. Mr. Bourke, the program spokesman, said the hungriest Zimbabweans were now in either Phase 3 or Phase 4. With Zimbabwe’s last maize harvest down by half compared with the year before because of drought, he said, the aid will continue until at least through the end of April, when the next harvest is due. But he was not optimistic. “The weather forecasters are basically saying we’re looking at a very dry growing season,” Mr. Bourke said. Ursula Mueller, the deputy emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations, who visited Zimbabwe in June, said the country’s travails were partly tied to a broader climate crisis in southern Africa that has rippled through all facets of life. Drought begets less food, which in turn begets declines in health and education and increases in crime and other “negative coping mechanisms,” she said.  “This is not just a food crisis. It is a wider more complicated situation,” she said in a telephone interview on Friday. “People have to make choices: Do I seek H.I.V. treatment or food?” Ms. Mueller also said a United Nations humanitarian budget for Zimbabwe had received only half the nearly $468 million requested, forcing her office to dip into other emergency funding. Humanitarian aid by the United Nations is financed almost entirely by voluntary contributions. Beyond immediate assistance, Ms. Mueller said that more investments were needed to address the root causes of problems in Zimbabwe and other countries that have the potential for more self-sufficiency.  “We need to move out of this cycle of dependency,” she said. Otherwise, “humanitarians find themselves in protracted situations for years.” Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Rick Gladstone from New York.']","Government dysfunction, an economic meltdown, drought and a calamitous flood have plunged Zimbabwe into a hunger crisis.

U.K. Arrests Man Who Sent £150 to Son Fighting With Kurds in Syria,2019-12-27,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The father of a British citizen who fought with Kurdish forces in northern Syria has been arrested on suspicion of financing terrorism, in a rare action taken against a relative of a European citizen who joined the Kurdish ranks. The father, Paul Newey, said on Friday that he had given £150, or about $196, to his son, Daniel, who traveled to Syria in October to fight with the People’s Protection Units, also known as the Y.P.G. The Kurdish force fought with the American military against the Islamic State, or ISIS, in Syria. Daniel Newey first went to Syria in August 2017. He returned home in March 2018, before going back to Syria this fall after Turkey launched an offensive in Kurdish-controlled territories. Paul Newey, 49, said he had not known his son had returned to Syria when he sent him the money. “I transfer money to him all the time, and I wanted to get him back on the road after all he’s been through since he’s been back,” Mr. Newey said in a telephone interview. Paul Newey was taken to a police station in Willenhall, England, on Dec. 11, after being arrested at his home in Solihull. The Guardian reported on Friday about the arrest of Mr. Newey, who was questioned for 36 hours and then released on bail. Mr. Newey was not charged, the police said. While prosecutors in France, Britain, Belgium and other European nations have charged relatives who sent money to Islamic State militants with terrorism offenses, no family members of volunteers who joined the Y.P.G. have faced similar charges. “The Terrorism Act in the U.K. has been used very broadly to prosecute financing of terrorism, and it’s been applied very harshly to parents of Islamic States fighters,” said Raj Chada, a criminal defense lawyer.  “Once you’ve gone down the route of prosecuting Kurdish fighters, it was inevitable that the families would also be arrested, or worse, prosecuted,” Mr. Chada added. The West Midlands police confirmed in an email that a 49-year-old man, whom they did not identify, had been arrested on Dec. 11 in Solihull on suspicion of terrorism offenses. The police said he had been released on bail pending further investigation. He has not been charged with a terrorism offense, the police said.  In recent months, the British authorities have taken a harder stance against people who have fought alongside Kurdish-led forces in Syria, a shift exemplified by a plan by Sajid Javid, recently the Home Office secretary, to designate northern Syria as a forbidden area. In May, Mr. Javid urged British citizens in the region to leave within 28 days, or face a 10-year prison sentence if they returned to Britain. The plan outraged many lawyers, academicians and British volunteers in Kurdish-controlled territories who, in a letter published in The Guardian, criticized Mr. Javid for dismissing the critical role played by Kurdish forces in the fight against ISIS.  “Using a law supposedly created to defend against ISIS, Javid is criminalizing as ‘terrorists’ those who have given more than any other British citizens in this struggle,” the signatories, which included the linguist Noam Chomsky and Mr. Chada, wrote in May.  At least eight British citizens died while fighting with the Kurdish forces in Syria. More than 11,000 Kurdish fighters died in combat against ISIS, according to Kurdish officials. In Britain, financing terrorism carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail under the Terrorism Act of 2000. In June, the parents of a British citizen who joined ISIS were found guilty of financing terrorism after they sent £223, or $292, to their son in 2015. They were sentenced to 15 months of prison, which was suspended to 12 months. The Y.P.G. is not considered a terrorist group by Britain or the United States; the government of Turkey has designated it as one. “Yet police officers kept telling me that my son was a terrorist,” Mr. Newey said about his interrogation earlier this month. A former British soldier, Daniel Burke, was charged this month with preparing an act of terrorism and financing terrorism after he spent months fighting with Y.P.G. forces in 2017 and 2018. Mr. Burke, 32, has also been accused of helping Mr. Newey travel to Iraq, according to British news reports. In a landmark case last month in Britain, Aidan James, 29, was sentenced to a year in prison for training with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., a Turkish group that has close ties with the Y.P.G. and is considered a terrorist organization by Britain, the United States and Turkey. But Mr. James was acquitted of terrorist charges for joining and fighting alongside the Y.P.G. In his sentencing remarks, the judge said that at the time Mr. James joined the Y.P.G., the group had no other goal than fighting against ISIS, and that such an action “was not terrorism at all.” Daniel Newey’s circumstance is somewhat different: His parents said he traveled back to Syria in October to fight against Turkish forces, months after ISIS had been dislodged from the last territory it held.  He has said that his father’s arrest and the potential charges against him would not deter him. He wrote in a Facebook post that Turkey’s actions were  like “crimes committed by the Nazis and various other regimes throughout recent history.” “Daniel doesn’t agree with the ethnic cleansing of Kurdish people and can’t comprehend why Western countries are sitting by and allowing atrocities to happen,” his mother, Vikki Downes, said.  Scores of people have been killed during the Turkish offensive into Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria, which began after President Trump ordered American forces to move away from the border between Syria and Turkey.  Human rights groups and Kurdish officials have criticized Western nations for abandoning the Kurdish forces. In a memo blaming the Trump administration for not trying harder to prevent the Turkish offensive, the senior American diplomat in northern Syria, William V. Roebuck, said the chaotic situation resulting from the incursion was “a catastrophic sideshow,” and that it was “to a significant degree of our making.” In Britain, Mr. Newey’s parents blamed their own government. His mother, Ms. Downes, said that because her son was allowed to keep his passport after returning from Syria last year, he was able to return there in October.  “I’m immensely proud of him, but very angry that my government has allowed him to travel,” Ms. Downes said. “If he doesn’t die, he will never be able to come to his home country.”']","The police arrested Paul Newey on suspicion of financing terrorism after his son, Daniel, traveled to Syria to fight with Kurdish-led forces."
Christmas Typhoon Batters Central Philippines,2019-12-26,By Jamie Tarabay,"['Typhoon Phanfone ravaged three provinces in the central Philippines over the Christmas holiday, with at least 16 people reported to have been killed. The typhoon made landfall on Tuesday at 4:45 p.m. over Salcedo in Eastern Samar Province, according to Pagasa, the national weather agency. The eastern portion of Samar Island caught the brunt of powerful winds and rainfall as the typhoon battered the province. Thirteen people were killed in western Visayas, the central of the three main island groups that make up the Philippines, news agencies quoted disaster agency officials as saying. Three others were reported to have died in the eastern part of the island group.  The typhoon, known in the Philippines as Ursula, was upgraded from a tropical storm as it approached the country. It led to the evacuation of more than 58,000 people and stranded thousands of travelers over the holiday period. Ferries were suspended and flights canceled. The storm prevented many in the overwhelmingly Catholic nation from traveling to be with their families for Christmas. Earlier in the week, the authorities advised residents in areas prone to floods and landslides to leave their homes as the typhoon picked up speed, with sustained winds up to 75 miles per hour, heavy rain and flooding. Among the places the typhoon hit was Tacloban, which was drowned within minutes when Typhoon Haiyan struck in 2013. This storm was less devastating but still managed to cause severe damage, shredding through houses, causing power outages and leading to the evacuation of hundreds of families there. The typhoon also hit Boracay, Coron and other popular tourist destinations.  Felled trees cut electricity in several provinces, and emergency services distributed food and medical aid. Roads were impassable across several provinces, disaster agencies reported. The typhoon was reported to be easing in strength on Thursday as it moved over the western Philippines toward the South China Sea. At least 20 typhoons have hit the Philippines this year, with one hitting three weeks ago as the country hosted the Southeast Asia Games. That typhoon, Kammuri, killed at least 17 people as it pummeled the capital, Manila, and surrounding areas.']",Thousands traveling home for the holiday were stranded as flights and ferries were canceled. At least 16 deaths were reported.
‘Not My Fault’: Women in Mexico Fight Back Against Violence,2019-12-26,By Paulina Villegas and Elisabeth Malkin,"['ECATEPEC, Mexico — Itan Flores was a young teenager when her first boyfriend imprisoned her for six weeks in a room furnished with just a mattress and a radio. He returned only to rape her, she said, often withholding food and water. She escaped when he forgot to lock the door one day. He told her that if she ever reported what happened to the police or to her parents, who thought she had gone voluntarily, he would kill her family.  “To this day, my parents do not know I was a prisoner,” Ms. Flores, 24, said, her eyes welling with tears. “For a long time I thought it was all my fault.” A new generation of Mexican women has taken to the streets in recent months to banish the idea that somehow — with their clothing, their demeanor, their whereabouts — they provoke the violence they suffer. That attitude is so entrenched in society that it extends to the police and the courts. The anger that is surfacing in Mexico is rippling across much of Latin America, where machismo is common, and law enforcement officials and the authorities can be passive, complicit or in some cases even abusive toward women who try to report it.  The women’s protests in Mexico have been raucous, and at times violent. Protesters have smashed bus stops and shattered the windows of police stations. Some have painted graffiti on monuments and thrown purple glitter at law enforcement officials.  In late November, women filled Mexico City’s giant central square to perform a song by a Chilean women’s collective that first swept the Spanish-speaking world, then spread far, to countries like Tunisia and Turkey. Since then, groups of women have repeated the performance at universities, on the streets or at events like the Guadalajara International Book Fair. “It was not my fault / neither where I was / nor what I was wearing,” goes the chorus of the chant, called “A Rapist in Your Path.”  Latin America is home to some of the countries with the highest homicide rates in the world, according to Small Arms Survey, which tracks violence globally. Across the region, as data gathering has improved, the phenomenon of gender-based violence is being acknowledged and better understood.  One out of every three women in Latin America has experienced sexual or physical violence, according to the United Nations, but 98 percent of gender-related killings in the region are not prosecuted.  Although violence against both men and women has reached record levels in Mexico, analysts say that many of the violent deaths of women are femicides, killings in which victims were targeted because of their gender. And the number of women who die violently in Mexico is climbing: It has gone up to 10 killings per day this year, from seven per day just two years ago, according to the Mexico office of UN Women, which is dedicated to gender equality and women’s empowerment.  The growing power of organized crime is also a factor in the rise in attacks on women, said Belén Sanz, the Mexico representative for UN Women, pointing to an increase in sex trafficking and disappearances that she said was likely tied to gangs. “There is a problem of violence against women that undoubtedly is related to the continuum of violence in general, but you can’t understand femicide without analyzing the amount of sexual and domestic abuse,” she said. What Mexico and other countries in the region are seeing now is a new generation that knows their rights and has learned to fight for them, said Lourdes Barrera, a member of Las Luchadoras, a Mexico City feminist collective. “There is a big clash between what they learned and the reality in Mexico: the harassment they suffer in the street, the violence from their partners, the violence you see every day,” Ms. Barrera said. The vigor of women’s protests has caught Mexican officials off guard. After a protest against police sexual abuse disrupted Mexico City in August, Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the demonstrators for damaging the Angel of Independence — a statue that is one of the city’s most famous landmarks — and called for an investigation. Facing an outcry, Ms. Sheinbaum quickly reversed course and met with women’s groups. Late last month, she promised to create a registry of sex offenders with a DNA database and pushed through a city law that makes sharing unauthorized sexual digital content a crime carrying a six-year prison sentence. But that scramble to respond in the capital finds little echo on the city’s periphery. In Ecatepec, a sprawling working-class suburb, women say the police do not protect them and are sometimes the attackers. “Living here means being forced to survive,” said Ms. Flores, the woman who said she was abducted by her boyfriend as a teenager. “It means always being on alert, always watching over your shoulder. It means being totally paranoid.” Forced to fend for themselves, women are forming groups to demand justice for unsolved crimes, to question long-held attitudes and to push the government into action. Ms. Flores joined five other women — including Magda Soberanes, 28, who was assaulted by her partner and ended up in the hospital — to create a collective called Women of the Periphery for the Periphery. But when they met with Ecatepec’s mayor earlier this year, he told them there were no funds to protect women. And when they sought Ecatepec’s women’s agency to talk about the number of women who had disappeared in the area, the director discounted the reports, Ms. Soberanes said. Grisel Barrientos, the director of the agency, said in an interview that documented cases of disappearances in Ecatepec show that most of them involve women who are later found to have left on their own. Met with such obstacles, women do what they can to protect themselves. They trade WhatsApp messages and share their locations during commutes. They carry whistles, pepper spray and sharpened pencils in case they are attacked. Many change into trousers to take public transportation after dark, and they are sure to stay alert. “It is unthinkable to fall asleep on the bus, no matter how long the commute is,” said Lucía Camacho, another member of the women’s group. “That is a man’s privilege.” The group organizes self-defense classes with a karate instructor and stages art performances to highlight how impunity persists. On a recent day, before an audience of criminology students, four of them donned black robes covered with the phrases men throw out in catcalls. Imagining the voices of the victims, they described murders that remained unpunished. “These young women are taking to the streets to reclaim their dignity, and they are teaching us great lessons,” said Eréndira Cruz, a special investigator of women’s issues at the National Commission for Human Rights in Mexico. “In the face of despair, they represent a profound hope,” she said.']","A new generation is demanding change, casting off the entrenched notion that women somehow provoke attacks against them.

"Pope Francis, in Christmas Speech, Urges Nations to Tend to Refugees",2019-12-25,By Anna Momigliano and Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — As Christians around the world celebrated Christmas, Pope Francis called on Wednesday for a softening of “stony and self-centered hearts,” once again directing the world’s attention to the plight of migrants and people living in areas plagued by conflict, social and political upheaval, injustice, or natural disasters. Addressing thousands of people gathered in St. Peter’s Square, the pope spoke of the millions of people who have fled their homes for “places where they might have hope for a dignified life,” only to find themselves “before walls of indifference.” Making his annual Christmas speech, Francis lamented the miseries of several trouble spots, urging the rest of the world to take responsibility for healing those places and to embrace the refugees who leave them. It has been one of the most powerful and consistent messages of his papacy, at a time when many nations have shown little interest in resolving foreign conflicts or taking in migrants and have often blamed newcomers for economic and social ills. Delivering his “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and to the World”) benediction from a balcony in the facade of St. Peter’s Basilica, the pope asked Jesus to “bless the efforts of those who spare no effort to promote justice and reconciliation and to overcome the various crises and the many forms of poverty that offend the dignity of each person.” Speaking of “the many children suffering from war and conflicts in the Middle East” and a Holy Land that still awaits “a time of peace, security and prosperity,” he urged “governments and the international community to find solutions to allow the peoples of that region to live together in peace and security, and put an end to their sufferings.” In the Americas, “where a number of nations are experiencing a time of social and political upheaval,” Francis called for comfort for “the beloved Venezuelan people, long tried by their political and social tensions.” Francis also called for “concrete solutions for an enduring peace” in Ukraine, and cited all those in Africa “who are persecuted for their religious faith, especially missionaries and members of the faithful who have been kidnapped,” as well as “victims of attacks by extremist groups, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Nigeria.” It is such suffering, he said, that has pushed millions of people to leave their homelands to find better lives. “It is injustice that makes them cross deserts and seas that become cemeteries,” he said, and “injustice that forces them to endure unspeakable forms of abuse, enslavement of every kind and torture in inhumane detention camps.” Francis spoke after military marching bands had played the Vatican and the Italian national hymns. “Brothers and sisters, Merry Christmas,” he began, to cheers. Warm applause greeted his address, and the pope then blessed the thousands in the square, and the thousands more who packed the broad avenue that leads to the basilica. “Hurray for the pope,” rose a cheer from the square. All people are called on “to give hope to the world,” Francis said, before wishing everyone “a good Christmas lunch.” Earlier Wednesday, Francis was one of three religious leaders who appealed directly to the leaders of South Sudan to end the violence there and form a transitional power-sharing government. Peace talks between the government and rebels stalled this week. The brief message — signed by Francis; Archbishop Justin Welby, the leader of the Anglican Church; and the Rev. John Chalmers, the former moderator of the Church of Scotland — said the leaders were praying for “a renewed commitment to the path of reconciliation and fraternity.” Peace in the mostly Christian country, the leaders said, would “bring to fulfillment our desire to visit your beloved country.” At a Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter’s, Francis spoke of God’s unconditional love. “Christmas reminds us that God continues to love us all, even the worst of us,” Francis said in his homily. Whether he had in mind priests who have sexually abused children was not clear, but his message might not be welcomed by victims and other critics who say the church has been far too forgiving of those priests and the prelates who have protected them.  “God does not love you because you think and act the right way. He loves you, plain and simple,” Francis said. “You may have mistaken ideas, you may have made a complete mess of things, but the Lord continues to love you.” Over the past year, Francis has strengthened the church’s stance in fighting the scourge of sexual abuse, convening a meeting in February of bishops from around the world to address the issue. In May, the Vatican mandated that those suspected of abuse be reported to their superiors. This month, it removed the high level of secrecy applied to such cases, which was often cited as a reason not to cooperate with the secular authorities, and which critics said had helped conceal the problem and let it fester in the church. Anna Momigliano reported from Rome, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Verbania, Italy.']","In his traditional holiday benediction, Francis renewed his call to resolve conflicts and to help those who have fled them.

The Atheist Preacher. The Thorn in Beijing’s Side. The Mayor Awaiting Her Murder.,2019-12-27,By The New York Times,"['The opposite of a celebrity profile, which offers a surface-skimming sketch of someone everyone knows, The Saturday Profile instead delivers an in-depth look at an unfamiliar but fascinating person doing influential work around the world. Since 2002, the profile has discovered artists, activists, entrepreneurs and others whose pursuits may not yet have reached a global audience, but whose efforts — sometimes eccentric, but always important — are making real differences on six continents. This year, for the first time, we’re offering a year-end roundup of three of our favorites in condensed form, giving readers the chance to meet for the first time, or get reacquainted with, characters worth knowing. Despite being an outspoken atheist, the Rev. Gretta Vosper has steadfastly maintained her place in the United Church of Canada, Canada’s pre-eminent Protestant church. Although as a child she claimed that Jesus had taught her to skate, Ms. Vosper never considered herself a devotee. Instead, she says she has always understood God obliquely, as love. Divinity school cemented her metaphorical views of God. But once she began preaching, she realized many congregants thought she was talking about an all-knowing, all-seeing spirit who answered prayers and called some to heaven and others to hell. “I realized how little of what I said got through to anyone,” said Ms. Vosper, 61. So four years after she was hired at West Hill United Church in Toronto, she delivered a sermon called “Deconstructing God,” laying bare her disbelief in a theistic God. She recalls congregation members hugging her afterward. “Most of the congregation was in a similar place theologically,” said Debbie Ellis, a member at West Hill, where Ms. Vosper was first hired in 1997. While the policies of the church are propelled more by social justice than theology, and its leadership supported abortion and same-sex union before either became legal in Canada, her stance still stirred an existential passion. She received death threats, one taped to the church’s front door that said, “Suffer the witch not to live.” The local jurisdiction of the church ruled her “unsuitable” for ministry since she “does not believe in God, Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit,” and she was on the verge of being defrocked. David Giuliano, the church’s leader from 2006 to 2009, compared Ms. Vosper to an Amazon manager who doesn’t believe in online shopping. “I suppose someone could have the skills to do it,” he said. “But why would she want to?” But Ms. Vosper’s congregation of self-described agnostics and atheists rallied behind her, and in November 2018, the local jurisdiction agreed that she could continue to minister her congregation in Toronto’s gritty east end. Since then, Ms. Vosper has slowly stripped away the traditional biblical language from her Sunday “weekly gatherings.” In its place, she has put words and rituals reflecting her congregation’s agreed beliefs — love, justice, compassion, integrity, forgiveness. To sit through a service at West Hill United is to feel as if you were watching a classic film that has been dubbed into a different language. Instead of the Lord’s Prayer, the congregation recites the “Words of Commitment,” which Ms. Vosper wrote with her husband, the church’s musical director. They stand to sing humanist hymns dedicated to peace and love that the two also wrote. To her, the close relationships between congregants is the definition of God. “I see us as beams of light between each of us, and that light is a source of strength and encouragement and courage and bravado sometimes and peace and healing,” she said. —Catherine Porter He has been mocked for years in China’s state-controlled news media for being fat, which he isn’t, and denounced more recently as a C.I.A. agent and a member of an American-directed “gang of four” supposedly responsible for orchestrating the Hong Kong protest movement. He says he isn’t those things, either. That China has put so much energy into demonizing Jimmy Lai, 71, is a measure of his singular status as the one prominent businessman in Hong Kong who openly supports antigovernment protests, routinely denounces the Communist Party leader Xi Jinping as a “dictator” and refuses to follow fellow tycoons in paying at least token obeisance to Beijing. As the majority owner of Next Media Group, which publishes Next, a weekly magazine, and Apple Daily, a popular newspaper and website, Mr. Lai has provided a powerful, wide-reaching platform to the mostly young and leaderless protesters. The Chinese Communist Party, which controls two newspapers in the city, has squeezed the revenue of both of Mr. Lai’s publications by pressuring companies not to advertise, which has meant a loss of print revenue of about $44 million. While all of the other prominent tycoons in Hong Kong have stayed silent about the protests or issued statements filled with Communist-style jargon about the need to “resolutely stop the turmoil,” Mr. Lai has not only supported the protesters but has also joined them. “The establishment hates my guts. They ask, ‘Why don’t you just let us make money in peace?’ They think I’m a troublemaker,” he said, adding: “I am a troublemaker, but one with a good conscience.” He has caused further anger by cheering on President Trump, whom he describes as “the only one who plays hardball with China. This is the only thing that China understands.” Born across the border in Guangdong Province, Mr. Lai fled to Hong Kong in a boat as a boy and was a typical success story in the then British-ruled city. He stayed away from politics and diligently worked his way up from lowly jobs as a knitter to become the main owner of Giordano, a successful chain of clothing stores. The 1989 Tiananmen bloodshed, he said, made him start thinking about politics and led to his setting up Next Magazine the following year, a move that quickly hurt his clothing business once he started writing insulting articles about leaders in Beijing. “I had always hoped that China was changing and would become a democracy. I was wrong. It was wishful thinking,” he said. In retaliation, the Chinese authorities began closing his Giordano clothing stores on the mainland. He realized he had to either sell or mind his tongue. He sold everything but his media holdings for nearly $320 million. That experience, he said, has helped him understand why so many of his fellow tycoons toe Beijing’s line. “As a businessman, you can’t confront the regime,” he said. Many business people, he says, do not believe their own statements against the protesters, but feel they have no choice but to show support for Beijing. This, he said, is understandable but also a mistake because China’s leaders “know that once they cow you, they can always cow you.” —Andrew Higgins Zarifa Ghafari, who at 26 became one of Afghanistan’s first female mayors, has said she fully expects to be assassinated. Yet she is not keeping a low profile. After taking office in March in Maidan Shar, a town of 35,000 in Afghanistan’s Wardak Province, she had a banner hoisted with her name, a picture of her wearing a bright red head scarf and the slogan of her anti-littering campaign: “Let’s keep our city clean.” Ms. Ghafari is well aware that she is on the front lines of the struggle for women’s rights in Afghanistan, at a time when American peace talks with the Taliban have Afghans thinking about what might happen if the ultraconservative insurgents take part in running the country again. “My job is to make people believe in women’s rights and women’s power,” she wrote on Twitter. Ms. Ghafari is not the first woman to assume a traditionally male job in Afghanistan’s patriarchal society. But she has one of the toughest imaginable positions. Wardak is a particularly conservative province, where support for the Taliban is widespread. Ms. Ghafari was appointed in the summer of 2018 by Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani. But after a disastrous first day as mayor, her term was delayed for months. After she arrived for work that July day, her office was mobbed by angry men brandishing sticks and rocks. She had to be escorted out by a squad of paramilitary officers. “That was the worst day of my life,” she said. “Don’t come back,” protesters jeered as she left. Ms. Ghafari left town, but not quietly. “I was screaming so much I lost my voice,” she said. She went straight to the presidential palace in Kabul. “I told them I will claim my right to office if I have to set myself on fire in front of the palace,” she said. “It was not an idle threat.” It took nine months, but Ms. Ghafari finally managed to return, and reporters paid a visit to Maidan Shar to see her in action. She took a group of municipal cleaners to distribute plastic trash bags for her clean city campaign. At the bazaar, a crowd of men and boys gathered as soon as she appeared. Garbage was strewn all over the streets, but most refused to take a trash bag. Ms. Ghafari held her ground, demanding that people take the free bags and use them. “It’s our city. We should keep it clean,” she yelled. “I can’t do this without your help.” The daughter of a high school teacher and a colonel in the Afghan special forces, Ms. Ghafari said she had never expected to work in government. She earned her bachelor’s degree in India and was studying for her master’s in economics when, during a visit home last year, her family encouraged her to sit for a civil service exam. She was back in India when a friend called: Mr. Ghani’s office had announced on Facebook that Ms. Ghafari had been named mayor. “I didn’t believe I could get this job, because I am a person with neither political power nor gold,” she said. “But when I did, I knew I wanted to be here and try to change society.” Ms. Ghafari’s doggedness has won grudging respect. In a meeting at the governor’s office, about a road project she has championed, there was a glimmer of support. “Give her some credit,” one of the men present said. “That project was stopped for 12 years, and she is here for a month and it’s restarted. She may be a woman, but she is powerful.” —Fatima Faizi and Rod Nordland']",
Japan to Deploy Destroyer to Middle East,2019-12-27,By Ben Dooley,"['TOKYO — Japan will send defense forces early next year to patrol regional shipping lanes in the Middle East, from which it sources much of its crude oil, the government announced on Friday. The rare overseas deployment, which will be limited to gathering intelligence, is meant to ensure the “security” of Japanese merchant ships and help maintain “peace and stability” in the region, the cabinet office said in a statement. The decision follows a series of attacks on oil tankers in the region, one of which was Japanese-operated.  The announcement also comes a week after a meeting in Tokyo between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, whose country the United States has blamed for attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman in June. The United States has called for an international coalition to protect ships in the region, but only a few of its allies have joined that mission.  The Japanese mission will be independent of any other nation’s deployments in the area, the cabinet office said Friday. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, speaking at a regular news conference, said intelligence-gathering operations could be conducted in “coordination with relevant countries.”  The deployment will include one destroyer, equipped with helicopters, and at least one of two P-3C patrol planes currently engaged in antipiracy operations near Somalia. It will be tasked with collecting information that “directly impacts the security of vessels navigating” the region, according to the cabinet office, which approved the plan on Friday. The mission has been authorized for one year and can be extended.  Japan has been careful to keep up good relations with Iran, and Mr. Abe has positioned himself to act as a possible intermediary between Tehran and Washington. He briefed Mr. Rouhani on Japan’s mission to the Middle East during their meeting, according to NHK, the Japanese national broadcaster.   Japan imports about 90 percent of its crude oil from the Middle East, and “given the rising tensions, it is necessary to strengthen our information collection system for ensuring the safety of Japanese vessels,” Mr. Suga said. Tokyo has come under pressure from President Trump to play a more active role in protecting its interests in the Middle East. Mr. Trump has complained that the country pays “zero compensation” for American patrols of shipping lanes in the region. He has also demanded that Tokyo cover more of the costs of stationing American troops in Japan. Japan’s pacifist Constitution limits its ability to participate in international military coalitions. Mr. Abe has moved to change that, despite public opposition, by issuing a reinterpretation of the Constitution and campaigning to amend it. The new deployment will be limited to the northern Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman and the Gulf of Aden, the cabinet office said. Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force operates a base in Djibouti, which was established in 2011 as a staging area for antipiracy operations. The government is describing the deployment as an “investigation and research” mission. The participating forces are not authorized to use weapons to protect other ships against attack, the cabinet office said.  However, if the situation warrants, the mission could be converted to a “maritime policing operation,” a designation that would allow the destroyer and planes to defend other vessels. The Maritime Self-Defense Force will not patrol the vital shipping lanes that run through the Strait of Hormuz. Analysts said that decision was meant to avoid giving the impression that Japan was taking sides with the United States against Iran, with which it has long maintained friendly relations. The June attack on the Japanese-operated tanker in the Gulf of Oman occurred while Mr. Abe was on an official visit to Iran. The United States blamed the attack on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which the Americans have labeled a terrorist organization. During their meeting last week, Mr. Abe encouraged Mr. Rouhani to adhere to Iran’s commitments under the 2015 agreement that froze its nuclear program, according to NHK.  Iran has been incrementally reducing its commitment to the agreement as it seeks relief from heavy economic sanctions imposed on the country by Mr. Trump, following his decision to withdraw the United States from the pact. Analysts say that Mr. Rouhani’s Japan trip was meant to signal a willingness to reopen long-stalled talks with Washington over Iran’s nuclear program.']",The rare overseas mission follows an attack on a Japanese oil tanker and increased American pressure to play a more active role in the region. 
The CBC’s Cut of a Scene From ‘Home Alone 2’ Draws the Trumps’ Ire,2019-12-27,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — Could Canada’s relations with the United States have taken a turn for the worse after its leading public broadcaster cut a seconds-long scene of President Trump from  “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York?” Canadians were momentarily pondering that unlikely question over the Christmas holidays after the CBC broadcast the 1992 film without a cameo by Mr. Trump. In the scene, the character Kevin McCallister, played by Macaulay Culkin, asks Mr. Trump how to get to the lobby of New York’s ornate Plaza Hotel (which Mr. Trump owned at the time). The CBC said the cut had been made for time’s sake, and before Mr. Trump’s political career, but as the omission drew media attention, Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. posted about it on Thursday on his Instagram account, calling the alteration “absolutely pathetic” and saying it proved that the news media “really are the enemy of the people.” That evening, President Trump himself weighed in, retweeting an article about the edited version and adding an allusion to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada: “I guess Justin T doesn’t much like my making him pay up on NATO or Trade!” A few minutes later, Mr. Trump tweeted a different headline, reporting claims that the incident was an example of censorship. But those Canadians worrying that the perceived slight had undermined relations with Canada’s most important ally felt relief on Thursday evening when Mr. Trump injected a note of humor to his commentary. “The movie will never be the same! (just kidding),” he wrote on Twitter. On Friday, Mr. Trudeau’s office declined to comment on the incident. The CBC, for its part, said the scene with Mr. Trump had been cut in 2014, before he declared his candidacy for president in 2015, and thus was not politically motivated. “CBC’s airing of Home Alone 2 was edited for time,” Chuck Thompson, a spokesman for the broadcaster, wrote on Twitter. “This happens regularly with films adapted for television. The scene with Donald Trump was one of several that were cut from the movie as none of them were integral to the plot.” Mr. Trudeau, a progressive known for his advocacy of women’s rights and the fight against climate change, has had a somewhat rocky relationship with Mr. Trump, who last year called him “very dishonest and weak.” More recently, he called Mr. Trudeau “two-faced” after the prime minister had been caught on video apparently gossiping about Mr. Trump with other world leaders at a NATO reception at Buckingham Palace. Before the latest brouhaha, Mr. Trump said this week that it had been an honor to be in the film. He mentioned the movie during a video conference call from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with members of the United States military. “A lot of people mention it every year, especially around Christmas,’’ he said. “They say, ‘I just saw you.’ Especially young kids, they say, ‘I just saw you on the movie.’ And it turned out to be a very big hit, obviously. It’s a big Christmas hit — one of the biggest. So it’s an honor to be involved in something like that. You always like to see success.” Some of Mr. Trump’s supporters lashed out at the Canadian broadcaster. “CBC TV in Canada has cut Donald Trump’s Home Alone 2 cameo out of their broadcast,” Ryan Fournier, the chairman of a pro-Trump student group, wrote on Twitter. “They’re so triggered by him that they had to edit him out of the film. Absolutely pathetic.” On the television program “Fox & Friends,” the co-host Ed Henry accused the CBC of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.” “I think they’re actually terrified that people will remember that before he was the new Hitler, he was actually a beloved mainstream cultural figure,” the commentator Mark Steyn added on the show. “I think they’re terrified of these little things that will remind people of just how deranged his opponents are.” But others commended the cut, including George Conway, a lawyer who is a vociferous critic of Mr. Trump and the husband of his adviser Kellyanne Conway. “You see, Senators? It’s not that hard,” he wrote on Twitter, apparently alluding to Congress’s impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is expected to face a trial early next year in the Senate, where his acquittal in the Republican-controlled chamber appears likely. Michael Crowley contributed reporting from West Palm Beach, Fla.']","The Canadian broadcaster said it removed the cameo for the sake of time five years ago. President Trump, his son and some supporters suggested the omission was politically motivated. "
"Blocked in U.S., Huawei Touts ‘Shared Values’ to Compete in Europe",2019-12-27,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — The committee room of the European Parliament was crowded with lawmakers and lobbyists who were facing off with executives of the telecommunications giant Huawei. One lawmaker, eager to raise the trust issue, got directly to the point: Could Huawei be a front for Chinese state espionage? Abraham Liu, the company’s top official in Europe, pushed right back. Huawei, he said, is completely independent, with no obligation to spy for China, and to do so “would be like committing suicide.”  Then he added a twist — and a veiled swipe at Huawei’s loudest critic, the Trump administration: It is Huawei, not America, that shares European principles. “Europe’s values of openness, innovation and the rule of law have led to it being a powerhouse in mobile communications — and Huawei shares these values,” Mr. Liu said. In Washington, Huawei is treated like a grave security risk over concerns that Chinese intelligence agencies could use the company’s technology to infiltrate the systems of foreign customers. Yet in Brussels, the European Union’s de facto capital, the company is waging a multifaceted charm offensive, partly by exploiting European distrust toward the Trump administration — and, for now, it is working. As the company competes to build Europe’s next-generation 5G wireless networks, Huawei is spending millions of dollars on an intensive advertising and lobbying campaign, while making a bold argument to European policymakers: That while the Trump administration is unpredictable and unreliable, Huawei is a guarantor of privacy, transparency and globalization.  The message hasn’t gone unnoticed, nor has the irony. “The Chinese have started brazenly claiming that it is China, not the United States, that shares more values with Europe,” said Julianne Smith of the German Marshall Fund in Washington. “Chinese scholars and officials also frequently remind European audiences that unlike the United States, China believes in climate change and multilateralism, a message that is especially powerful in a place like Germany,” she said. To push its message, Huawei has made unexpected moves. One is the hearing, in October, in which Mr. Liu spoke about values. It was not a case of a corporate leader being hauled before lawmakers for a grilling. Instead, Huawei had organized the “public debate” with members of the European Parliament, live-streamed the proceeding and posted the video online. In the United States, the Trump administration has essentially blocked Huawei, but Mr. Trump’s efforts to push European allies to ban Huawei have fallen flat.  Neither the European Union nor individual countries have moved to restrict the company’s access to their markets. Hungary, whose far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, identifies himself as a Trump ally, announced in November that Huawei would lead its 5G infrastructure rollout.Even as government officials have debated its role, Huawei has forged ahead, and says it has already made dozens of deals to sell 5G hardware to wireless carriers across Europe. The extent of its involvement is unclear, because a single carrier can buy gear from multiple vendors, and some pieces of equipment are more security-sensitive than others. And at a NATO gathering near London this month, when Mr. Trump pressed Prime Minister Boris Johnson to shut Huawei out of Britain, Mr. Johnson — who has postponed a decision on the question — was noncommittal. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an opinion piece published by Politico Europe, implored policymakers “not to give control of their critical infrastructure to Chinese tech giants.” To a degree, European policymakers in charge of assessing risks to cybersecurity share the United States’ concerns about Huawei. A recent European Union report highlighted, without naming Huawei, that a non-European 5G technology provider could be forced to allow its government to hack into and even control its networks, enabling access to private data, trade secrets and national security operations. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that Huawei should be allowed to compete for 5G contracts, but other politicians have pushed back, indicating that the company could be in for a fight there. “No Chinese company is an independent company,” Norbert Röttgen, a former government minister from Ms. Merkel’s party, said recently, adding that Huawei’s involvement was “an imminent question of national security.” Yet one German telecommunication company, Telefonica Deutschland, has announced that it intends to contract Huawei for its 5G development. European Union rules make it difficult to target individual companies for political reasons. The bloc could impose stringent standards of conduct and openness for 5G contractors that could be used to restrict Huawei but, as yet, has simply let each member country to decide how to proceed. Distrust toward the Trump administration is also a significant factor, as European policymakers worry that American sanctions on Huawei are simply a bargaining chip in the United States’ broader trade war with China and might be reversed. “There is a fear that if you take what potentially are quite expensive decisions with regards to 5G because the Americans have told you that they are a security problem, and then President Trump gets a trade deal with China and suddenly Huawei is all O.K. again, then you’ll feel like the earth has moved under your feet,” said Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Center for European Reform, a policy group in London. Years before the advent of 5G, Huawei was establishing a major presence in Europe, where it ranks third in mobile phone sales, behind Samsung and Apple. The company says it has 12,000 employees, and 23 research and development centers in Europe, a way of building favor and familiarity with policymakers. And it has moved boldly to position itself in Brussels. Huawei has spent more than $3 million this year on advertising and lobbying, according to its disclosures in the European Union lobbying registry. That is more than the combined spending of its European 5G competitors, Ericsson and Nokia, and far more than its American rival, Qualcomm. In a huge advertising campaign this year, the company plastered banners featuring happy faces at Brussels Airport and in key spots around the city. “Vote for 5G,” they read. “#Vote Smarter.” In a press packet sent to hundreds of journalists there, Huawei argued that “It is crucial to roll out 5G the European way, in line with European values.” Huawei, it added, was best placed to guarantee those values. The company also placed advertising in the most insider-focused journalism product in town, Politico Europe’s daily newsletter. “Brussels Playbook, presented by Huawei — Vote for 5G,” the subject line of an early-morning email read in late May this year. Huawei has made donations to at least two major research institutions in Brussels that study European policy. Several other institutions receive funding from the Chinese government.  For Huawei, public records show that the amounts are relatively small, about $55,000 per organization. But they guarantee that the company is a player in the Brussels policy machinery. In an interview, Mr. Liu said the company spent money on advertising and lobbying because of “attacks from the U.S. toward Huawei.” He said the company was “obliged to talk to the stakeholders in Europe and also the rest of the word, because the U.S. is very powerful — the U.S. government is super-powerful.” “They’re trying to murder us,” he said. In many ways, Huawei is using the Brussels playbook of major American technology players like Google, which has pioneered the use of public advertising campaigns in Brussels to influence legislation or regulations. The two companies even share a small, unassuming office building three blocks from the European Commission, where Google occupies three floors and Huawei one. A review of the European Commission’s transparency register shows that Huawei employees met with top officials from the Commission, including commissioners and their top civil servants or members of their cabinets, 46 times in the past five years. The vast majority of those meetings were about 5G, the register shows. Mr. Liu says his company’s continued presence in Europe demonstrates Washington’s failure to show any concrete evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei. “It’s not fair on us as a private company to face such a challenge from a superpower,” he said. “And for Europe, we appreciate that the European stakeholders take a different approach.”']","The Chinese tech giant is spending millions of dollars on a charm offensive in Brussels, hoping for a leading role in building 5G networks.

Traffic Circles Are Everywhere in France. Not Everyone Is Happy.,2019-12-25,By Aurelien Breeden,"['ABBEVILLE, France — Every day, about 65,000 vehicles cruise through the center of Abbeville, passing by its Gothic church, City Hall and rows of red brick houses, with many drivers on their way to the English Channel about a dozen miles away. But they never stop for a red light. None exist in this town of about 25,000 people. Instead, drivers bank, swerve and loop their way through traffic circle after traffic circle.  Their ubiquity in Abbeville is an extreme example of France’s unabashed embrace of the roundabout, found in abundance throughout the country and widely credited for making roads safer and less clogged.  Even in Abbeville, on a recent morning, workers in fluorescent orange vests and hard hats were breaking ground on yet another traffic circle, as cars were backed up by the construction. Roundabouts played a central role in the Yellow Vests protests, when demonstrators occupied hundreds of the nation’s roundabouts, blocking traffic as a way to demonstrate against a despised fuel tax increase in particular and a growing sense of inequality in general. But France’s relationship with them has in some ways soured, their very pervasiveness making them a convenient scapegoat for many of France’s ills, real or perceived.  Pierre Vermeren, a French historian writing in Le Figaro last year, said roundabouts were a “symbol of ugly France” and the “emblem of French malaise.”  There are no official statistics, but estimates of the total number of traffic circles in France range from 20,000 to 50,000. In the United States — about 18 times bigger and five times more populous than France — the figure is closer to 5,000.  [Read: Departing: Two Shopkeepers, Their Cat and Part of Paris’s Soul.] For some, the roundabout, a concept imported from Britain in the 1970s and quickly spread by the firm hand of the French state, embodies the unchecked spending of taxpayer money on pet projects by government officials, especially mayors, who in the 1980s took over road management from the central government.  Many officials “saw the roundabout as a kind of fashionable object,” said Éric Alonzo, a professor at the École d’architecture de la ville & des territoires in suburban Paris who has written a book on traffic circles.  “I heard from technicians who weren’t necessarily recommending that solution,” he said, “but elected officials were saying, ‘I want one.’” For others, roundabouts are a constant reminder of an overreliance on cars and have come to symbolize deeper worries about French cultural identity, as urban sprawl and giant malls suck the life out of city centers, killing traditional bakers and butchers.  “Roundabouts have become the focal point that symbolizes, to the point of caricature, everything else’s flaws,” Mr. Alonzo said.  If there was anyone left in France who didn’t have an opinion about them, that changed last year during the Yellow Vest protests.  “The France of roundabouts” has even become the shorthand way to describe the small cities and towns in peripheral France, where many feel left behind, and where the Yellow Vest protests spontaneously started before migrating to Paris in what became months of often violent protests.  In Abbeville last year, some Yellow Vest protesters first gathered at one of the town’s biggest roundabouts, near a major shopping mall.  It was once the site of a sugar refinery so large that in May 1940, after German bombs set it on fire, 35,000 tons of sugar were transformed into caramel, sending residents rushing into the street with pots and pans to scoop up the precious syrup. Like many of northern France’s former industrial powerhouses, all that remains today of that factory is a single, giant smokestack. On a recent visit, there were no Yellow Vests in sight at the roundabout. Their protests have been tamped down by a combination of government concessions and police repression at protest sites. And the focus of worker anger in France has switched of late to the plans of President Emmanuel Macron to streamline the nation’s convoluted pension system. Whatever anyone thinks of roundabouts as symbols of an ailing France, the residents of Abbeville concede that, in practical terms, they make life on the road easier. Even during the summer, with seaside-bound vacationers from around the region using the city’s streets and bridges over the Somme River, the roundabouts keep cars moving.  “I didn’t wake up one morning and say to myself, ‘What if I removed all the traffic lights?’” said Nicolas Dumont, the mayor of Abbeville. “It’s a very pragmatic policy.” To cut down on the noise, traffic jams and fender benders occurring at one intersection, Mr. Dumont decided in 2010 to turn the troublesome spot into a roundabout. It solved the problems. Ten more traffic circles followed. In October, the city’s only remaining traffic light was sawed down. Mélanie Cathelin, who runs a toy store on one of Abbeville’s main shopping streets, said she now finds traffic lights in other cities jarring, whether in neighboring Amiens or on a recent vacation in Florida. “It’s almost annoying,” Ms. Cathelin said. Roundabouts, she granted, “work pretty well.”  Freddy Roger, a roofer sipping a beer at the Green Harp, a pub next to where the last traffic light once stood, said roundabouts used up “less electricity,” were “prettier” and safer.  “With a traffic light, it’s not just a minor accident,” he added, slamming one hand into the other. “It’s frontal.” For one Abbeville resident, the absence of traffic lights was something of a professional hindrance. Christophe Blotas, a driving instructor, said he has to take his students to another town to teach them how to handle the red, green and amber.  There is no denying, Mr. Alonzo said, that the spread of roundabouts has given France’s roadways an air of visual uniformity, creating traffic features that look similar no matter where you are. To counter that blandness, local authorities sometimes decorate traffic circles, but some of their choices have come under fire as aesthetically questionable, like a giant yellow arm adorned with careening autos, which burned last year after Yellow Vest protesters set fire to the camp they had set up in its shadow.  A roundabout in the eastern town of Pontarlier, where drivers are greeted by an oversized red face purporting to depict André Malraux, the French writer, was last year voted France’s “worst.” But Mr. Alonzo said roundabouts were often unfairly blamed for the policies that produce them, like unrestricted commercial zoning on city outskirts that pulls in lots of traffic and creates a need for access ramps, parking lots — and multiple roundabouts.  “Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water,” Mr. Alonzo said, arguing that roundabouts “have their relevance, but it all depends where and how.”']","Traffic circles are ubiquitous in France, accepted as safer than traditional intersections. But they have also become an emblem of the country’s ailments, from urban sprawl to inequality. "
Nicaragua Has a Simple Message for Protesters: Don’t,2019-12-26,By Frances Robles and Cesar Rodriguez,"['MASAYA, Nicaragua — Diana Lacayo never imagined that a hunger strike held in a church would turn into a nine-day siege, with the police outside and the electricity and water cut off inside.  But to the Nicaraguan authorities, even this modest protest was a challenge to be crushed. For nearly two years, Nicaraguans have been rising up against the grip of one family, the Ortegas, who are accused of turning the country into a personal fief: The president has no term limits, the first lady is the vice president and their children hold top posts in industries like gas and television.  In the face of unrest, the government has used uncompromising measures to silence public dissent. And despite a collapsing economy, American sanctions and mass emigration, President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, still hold power firmly. Once seen as a national hero for his leadership of the leftist Sandinista Front that overthrew the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in the 1970s, now Mr. Ortega is seen by many in this generation of Nicaraguans as an autocratic ruler himself.  As pro-government activists sow violence in the streets, voices of dissent are silenced by arrest and assault. Roughed up and robbed by government supporters, protesters sometimes return home from demonstrations without phones or even shoes. “If we go outside with a flag, we go to jail,” Ms. Lacayo said.  The standoff here at San Miguel Arcángel Church made clear that no place is a sanctuary. Desperate to be heard, Ms. Lacayo and eight other women went there to see whether a hunger strike might win freedom for their husbands, brothers and sons, political activists who are languishing in government prisons. By the time it was over, 14 people in all, including a Catholic priest, had spent more than a week locked inside, surrounded by the police, as basic supplies dwindled to near nothing. “They left us like rats in a hole,” said the Rev. Edwing Román, the pastor who was trapped in the church with the protesters.  For Nicaraguans, it was another reminder that simply speaking out can have severe consequences. Last year, it looked as if the president might be on the ropes as Nicaraguans mounted their largest protests in decades. Though the government rebounded, the hunger strikers at San Miguel Arcángel and other protesters were buoyed by the ouster this fall of Mr. Ortega’s Bolivian ally, Evo Morales. But for all their shared leftist ideology and authoritarian leanings, Mr. Ortega enjoys one thing Mr. Morales did not: The military and the national police have stayed at his side, protecting him as security forces have done for Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and other authoritarian leaders around the world.  And so in Nicaragua, protests have led only to more arrests, even as crisis racks the country. The economy is spiraling, and nearly 100,000 people have fled. In the face of all this, Mr. Ortega and his wife have offered a portrait of Nicaragua as a country much safer than its neighbors, and a new slogan warns of the dangers of disruption: “You don’t play around with peace.” Still, Nicaragua is far from safe: In reporting about the siege at the church, I was assaulted two days in a row. The first time was a quick whack by a woman angry over having her photograph taken. A day later, a crowd of Mr. Ortega’s Sandinista Front party activists, who had gathered outside the chapel surrounded me, pushed me to the ground and tried to wrestle my phone away. Then someone smashed a paving stone through my rental car’s windshield as I fled. The police, who were present, did not intervene. Mr. Ortega rose to prominence in Nicaragua as a guerrilla fighter in the 1970s, when he helped to lead a popular grass roots uprising to bring down the right-wing dictatorship of Mr. Somoza.  The Sandinista guerrillas declared victory in 1979. Mr. Ortega became president and ruled Nicaragua throughout the 1980s, but counterrevolutionary forces known as the Contras tried to topple him using secret, illicit financing by the Reagan administration. Mr. Ortega lost elections in 1990, but returned to power in 2007. The protests began in the spring of 2018, when entire cities rose up against the Ortegas. They began over social security cuts, and soon turned into a widespread rebuke of the increasingly undemocratic government. The Supreme Court had been stacked, legislators forced out, municipal elections stolen and term limits scrapped. Three months later, the government took the streets back. In a crushing crackdown, the police fired on protesters who had set up roadblocks around the country. Nationwide, more than 300 people died, including 22 police officers. Dozens of protesters who burned buildings, took over universities for months and blocked roads for weeks are still in prison, among them Ms. Lacayo’s son, Scannierth Merlo Lacayo, 22, who was sentenced to five years. In November, Ms. Lacayo and other women with jailed relatives approached Father Román and asked whether they could use his church for a hunger strike. The priest agreed: “Thinking that this was a civilized country, I said yes.” Father Román, 59, is one of several priests in Nicaragua who have assumed leading roles in the insurrection — a cadre of clerics who have minced no words, using words like “dictatorship” to describe the government.  Ms. Lacayo, 48, and the other hunger strikers arrived at San Miguel around 9 a.m. on a Thursday, and the police immediately surrounded the church. At one point, they blocked the front doors and refused to let Father Román inside to offer Mass in his own church — so the parishioners prayed outside. The priest eventually made it inside, but just as communion was ending, the lights went out. The authorities had cut the power. “Father said: ‘Quick! Fill the barrels with water!’” said José Román Lanzas, a 13-year-old altar boy. “Sure enough, what did the government do? They cut off the water.” The boy made it out, but five people, including a lawyer and human rights activist who were supporting the women, were trapped inside. “We thought we were going there to have a hunger strike, not a siege,” said Karen Lacayo Rodríguez, 42, a former Sandinista whose 45-year-old brother, Edward E. Lacayo Rodríguez, is serving a 15-year sentence in a drug-trafficking case his family said was staged. (She is not related to Diana Lacayo.) Father Román said: “When we opened the windows, the police outside would say to the mothers, ‘You are going to come out in black bags, smelling bad.’ We were hostages.” Mothers of other prisoners tried to hold similar strikes at other churches. At the national cathedral in Managua, government supporters stormed in and roughed up a priest.  “We are living in a country without rules,” said the priest, the Rev. Rodolfo López, whose beating was caught on video. “We’re talking about a situation here where people deliberately, freely, offer their souls to the devil,” he said of the president and first lady. The hunger strike at the cathedral ended within a day, but at San Miguel the situation grew dire. The women slept on the floor, using curtains as blankets. Clothing donated for the poor was distributed so they could change. The women on the hunger strike had come prepared with electrolyte drinks, and the priest shared the contents of the rectory pantry with those who were not striking. At night, hecklers threw rocks and rattled the metal garage gate. Nobody could bathe. Volunteers who tried to bring water were arrested and charged with trafficking weapons. Still, they managed to bring in several gallons, and it rained twice, offering a few days of water and a chance to rinse off. Eventually, their cellphone batteries ran out. They sent a message to supporters: If the church bells ring, someone is in mortal peril.  Eight days into the standoff, traffic was closed off for two blocks and dozens of police officers were lined up outside. The doors and windows were shuttered. The police did not allow anyone to enter, but they said the protesters were welcome to leave at any time. “Don’t go writing in your notebook that we locked them inside,” a police official said. “If they want to come out, they can come out.” He then ordered me to leave.  By the ninth day, food and water was running out. Father Román, who has diabetes, passed out twice and became delirious as his blood sugar dropped. The women said the priest had told them he was willing to die. But while the women were prepared to give their own lives to the cause, they did not want to surrender his. They used the one telephone they had saved for emergencies — it had just 1 percent battery left — and gave up. The Red Cross ushered in an ambulance and freed the 14 people. “The priest was in bad, bad, bad shape,” said one hunger striker, Martha L. Alvarado, 47, whose son, Melkissedex A. López Ferrey, 30, is serving four years for robbery after participating in the protests last year. “But when the ambulance came, he did not want to get on the stretcher. He said, ‘I am leaving here on my feet.’” Several of the 14 people spent days in the hospital. Far from feeling defeated, the women felt victorious: Word of the siege at the church led to international condemnation.  Vice President Murillo, who is also minister of communications, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. In the past, she has accused the protesters of being tools of the United States, which has a long history of supporting violent insurrection against socialists in the region. “What do the people want? Peace,” Ms. Murillo said in a recorded broadcast. “What do people want? Work. What do the people want? Security. Stop screwing with us!” As the hunger strike at the church began, one of the Ortega children, Juan Carlos Ortega, declared, “We condemn this coup plan.” The government has said that many protesters are armed and that the news media has ignored atrocities they have committed, including murders and burning down government buildings. Protesters like Karen Lacayo reject the claims. “They say we have missiles, this and that, but the only weapon we have is the flag and our voice,” she said. “We want a free Nicaragua.” With tensions rising around the country, police officers have stormed the homes of opposition activists, tied them to chairs and humiliated them by recording video of them promising to stop harassing Sandinistas. “They brought weapons of war,” said Diego Reyes Alonso, 26, one of the people who was tied up. “They did not even bring a search warrant or any document, not even to pretend that this was legal.” Mr. Reyes was studying information systems engineering but was expelled from college, his entire transcript wiped clean, he said, after he participated in the protests. Activists say the government’s actions show that the Ortega administration is panicked over the toppling of the Bolivian government. Elections are not until 2021, and few people believe that the Ortegas will allow international observers to ensure that the race is free of fraud — though few opposition leaders have emerged, in any case. For a time after the impasse at San Miguel Arcángel, Father Román stayed away from his church. But his duties drew him back: 120 children needed to make their First Communion. When he got there, he found seven riot police officers still stationed at the church — and the power still turned off.']",
Christmas Eve Wildfire in Chile Destroys Dozens of Homes,2019-12-25,By Pascale Bonnefoy,"['SANTIAGO, Chile — A wildfire raged through a residential area on the outskirts of the Chilean city of Valparaíso, prompting evacuation orders and destroying more than 200 homes by Wednesday, Chile’s interior minister said. The blaze, which started on Tuesday, was only partly under control by Wednesday, but had begun to shift from populated areas to forested land, the interior minister, Gonzalo Blumel, said. There were no reports of casualties as residents had been evacuated.  The mayor of Valparaíso, Jorge Sharp, told local news outlets early Wednesday that there were indications that the fire had been set on purpose.  “This fire presents characteristics of evident intentionality,” Mr. Sharp told the national television station, citing the fact that fire appeared to start in several places at around the same time.  The fire’s rapid spread was worsened by steady winds and warm, dry weather that came as the country experienced its worst drought on record, according to government officials.  “2019 has been the year with the least rainfall in history, as far as records show, and it has worsened over the past few months, beyond all our expectations,” said Alfredo Moreno, the minister of public works, in a news conference last week.  Wildfires, which are exacerbated by climate change, have caused widespread destruction in Australia, Brazil, the United States and other countries this year. Valparaíso is a port city in central Chile filled with vividly painted homes that line its hillside streets. It has seen large fires in years past, including one that left 12 dead in 2014.  Photos taken in the city on Tuesday showed homes engulfed in flames. The affected area includes some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods, where the rugged topography and narrow, winding roads make access difficult for firefighters.  The roads in some of the affected neighborhoods are unpaved and homes can lack running water. The municipal government sends trucks with water to supply residents a couple of times a week. The housing can be precarious, made of tin, cardboard or wood. In a post on Twitter early on Wednesday, Mr. Sharp, the mayor, said city officials had declared an emergency in the local area to “facilitate debris removal and reconstruction.”  “In addition, we will file a complaint against those who are responsible for the obvious intentionality of this fire,” the mayor wrote. Two shelters were set up for those displaced by the fire, according to a statement from city officials. Chile’s president, Sebastián Piñera, said in a statement posted on his Twitter account that emergency responders were working “tirelessly” to combat the blaze. “We deeply regret the fire that affects so many families in the hills of Valparaíso and especially on Christmas Eve,” he said.']",Firefighters struggled to control the blaze on a hillside in Valparaíso. The city’s mayor said the fire might have been set intentionally.
"With U.S. Help No Longer Assured, Saudis Try a New Strategy: Talks",2019-12-26,By Declan Walsh and Ben Hubbard,"['CAIRO — In the months since a missile and drone attack widely seen as the work of Iran left two Saudi oil facilities smoldering, the Saudi crown prince has taken an uncharacteristic turn to diplomacy to cool tensions with his regional enemies. The prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has stepped up direct talks with the rebels he has been fighting in Yemen for over four years, leading to a decline in attacks by both sides.  He has made gestures to ease, if not end, the stifling blockade he and his allies imposed on his tiny, wealthy neighbor, Qatar.  He has even engaged in indirect talks with the kingdom’s archnemesis, Iran, to try to dampen the shadow war raging across the region. Fueling the shift from confrontation to negotiation, analysts say, is the sobering realization that a decades-old cornerstone of American policy in the Middle East — the understanding that the United States would defend the Saudi oil industry from foreign attacks — can no longer be taken for granted. Even though American and Saudi officials agreed that Iran was behind the Sept. 14 attacks on the petroleum processing plants at Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily halving Saudi Arabia’s oil production, President Trump responded with heated rhetoric but little else. For the Saudis, the tepid response drove home the reality that despite the tens of billions of dollars they have spent on American weapons — more than $170 billion since 1973 — they could no longer count on the United States to come to their aid, at least not with the force they expected. Worried about having to fend for themselves in a tough and unpredictable neighborhood, analysts say, the Saudis have quietly reached out to their enemies to de-escalate conflicts. “I think we will look at Sept. 14 as a seminal moment in gulf history,” said David B. Roberts, a scholar of the region at King’s College London. With the presumption shattered that the United States would protect the Saudis, Dr. Roberts said, “they realize the need to be more accommodating.” For the United States, the shift toward diplomacy is an awkward paradox. The Trump administration and Congress have been pressing the Saudis to end the war in Yemen, and the administration has pushed them to reconcile with Qatar, largely in vain. Now, the presumed Iranian strikes may have done more to advance those goals than American pressure ever did. Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy turned more aggressive after Prince Mohammed, then 29, emerged as its driving force in 2015. He plunged the kingdom into a devastating war against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen; imposed a punishing boycott on Qatar, which he accused of supporting terrorism and cozying up to Iran; and vowed to confront Iran across the Middle East. Critics said the young prince was brash and headstrong, and a destabilizing force in the region. Moreover, the Yemen and Qatar campaigns failed to achieve the desired results. The war in Yemen settled into a costly stalemate with the side effect of a devastating humanitarian crisis, while Qatar employed its vast wealth and other international relationships to weather the blockade. Then the refinery attacks highlighted the vulnerability of the Saudi oil industry, the country’s economic jewel.  Those events led to what Rob Malley, a top official for the Middle East in the Obama administration, describes as a “semi-recalibration” of Saudi policies. The sudden willingness to pursue diplomacy in Qatar and Yemen, he said, “reflects a Saudi desire to solidify its regional posture at a time of uncertainty and vulnerability.” Analysts saw the lack of a significant American response to the attacks as a blow to the policy known as the Carter doctrine, which dates to 1980, when President Jimmy Carter vowed to use force to ensure the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf after the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Subsequent presidents, Democrats and Republicans, upheld it, seeing Saudi oil exports as essential to the global economy and America’s interests. “For as long as I have been working on the Middle East, that’s why we were there: to protect the free flow of oil,” said Steven Cook, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to a period dating to the 1980s. After the attacks, Mr. Trump sent more American troops to Saudi Arabia to operate Patriot missile systems, support that fell far short of what the Saudis had expected from a president whom they considered a close friend and who shared their animosity toward Iran. Mr. Trump ordered, then abruptly called off, airstrikes on Iran. “What the Saudis didn’t understand,” Dr. Cook said, “was that Donald Trump is a lot closer to Barack Obama’s worldview than they realized. It’s about getting out of the Middle East.” The Saudis’ reputation in Washington had suffered gravely because of the war in Yemen, the Qatar blockade and the killing of the dissident Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul last year.  While anger spread in Congress and other parts of the government, Mr. Trump continued to support the kingdom as an important Arab ally and a reliable buyer of American arms. But as a presidential election looms, the Saudis realize that Mr. Trump could find that position to be a liability with voters, and a new president could take an entirely different approach. “It is a hard ask, even for Trump, to defend Saudi Arabia at every turn during a campaign,” said Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “So I think the Saudis are smart enough to tone it down for a time.” Daylight also broke between Saudi Arabia and its closest regional ally, the United Arab Emirates. In June, the Emirates began withdrawing its troops from Yemen, leaving the Saudis with the burden of an ugly war that few believe they can win. In July, the Emirates hosted rare talks with Iran about maritime security, an effort to calm tensions in the Persian Gulf and safeguard the country’s reputation as a safe business hub. Saudi officials did not respond to a request for comment on the recent diplomacy. While those overtures have yet to yield official agreements, they have eased pressures in the region. In Yemen, both sides have released more than 100 prisoners to show good will, and cross-border attacks by the Houthis have grown less frequent. Last month the United Nations envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, reported an 80 percent reduction in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition over the previous two weeks. Since then, no Yemeni civilians have been killed in airstrikes, said Radhya Almutawakel, the chairwoman of Mwatana, a Yemeni human rights group. The current de-escalation, she noted, is the first that resulted from direct talks with the Houthis. She suspected that the Saudis would not have chosen that route if the war had been going their way at the time of the Abqaiq attack. “They would not have chosen to speak with the Houthis,” she said. “They would have escalated the war.” In the standoff between Saudi Arabia and its allies and Qatar, demonstrable progress has been scarce but quiet talks between the countries’ leaders have softened the conflict’s rougher edges.  Saudi social media accounts that often insulted Qatar’s emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, have toned it down. And while Qatar has not shut down its Al Jazeera satellite network as the Saudis demanded, criticism of Qatar from pro-government news outlets and social media accounts in Saudi Arabia has noticeably quieted in recent months, Qatari officials say.  Instead of punishing citizens who travel to Qatar, Saudi Arabia now looks the other way, and has even sent soccer teams to play in tournaments in Doha, the Qatari capital. And although Qatar’s emir did not accept an invitation by the Saudi monarch, King Salman, to attend a regional summit meeting in Saudi Arabia this month, Qatar’s foreign minister did. The Qataris have also gained ground in Washington. While Mr. Trump initially cheered the blockade, endorsing the Saudi allegation that Qatar supported terrorism, he later switched tracks. Last year, he welcomed Qatar’s emir in Washington and this month sent his daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, to a major conference in Doha. But the antagonism toward Qatar has not softened in the Emirates, which has been a leader of the embargo and which still sees Qatar as dangerously close to the region’s Islamists. The distrust is reciprocated by Qatar, where officials have spoken of possibly reconciling with Saudi Arabia but not the Emirates, effectively splitting their alliance. Concrete progress has been scarcest where the stakes are highest: between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But after years of heated statements and competing support for opposite sides in regional conflicts, officials from Pakistan and Iraq have stepped in as intermediaries for back-channel talks aimed at averting a wider conflict. It remains unclear how far such talks will go in reducing tensions, especially since an official Saudi opening with Iran could infuriate Mr. Trump, who has tried to isolate and punish Iran. “Washington would not look kindly upon a Saudi-Iranian channel at a time when the U.S. is trying to isolate Iran,” said Mr. Malley, the Obama administration official. “Not to fully trust the Trump administration is one thing. To openly defy it is another altogether, and Prince Mohammed is unlikely to do that.” Saeed al-Batati and Shuaib Almosawa contributed reporting from Yemen.']","Worried that they can no longer count on American defense, the Saudis have begun talking to their enemies to cool conflicts in the region.

Highlights From a Year of Traveling Across Canada,2019-12-27,By Ian Austen,"['While it’s not vacation travel, one of the great privileges of my job is regularly seeing various parts of Canada. Often, that means going to places well off the typical tourist track. And, just as frequently, those communities prove to be the most interesting destinations. On almost every trip, I stumble across discoveries big and small that are completely unrelated to the article that has lured me out. Before going over some highlights from this year, I should note that nearly all the people I approach while on assignment are happy to speak with me and generous with their time.  There are exceptions, of course: in communities at the heart of a major news story where many residents come to feel under siege and retreat, to use an understandable example. And often during interviews anywhere in the country, I run into people who become more open once they learn that I’m Canadian and not, as they had assumed, American. After many years, I’m still not entirely sure what that’s about. But, on the whole, we are a nation that is welcoming to strangers and keen to tell its stories. And before I go through a partial list of small, but welcome, surprises from my travels, I would like to offer my best wishes to all Canada Letter readers and their families for 2020. — When time permits, I try to pay at least a quick visit to any history museum I come across. Sometimes that provides context for my stories. It always sates my curiosity. After many years of not having time during its open hours to visit the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, I finally made it inside this fall. It’s a great place. But what really distinguishes the Glenbow is its approach to an issue many museums are facing: how to present the story of Indigenous people in Canada within institutions largely built around the experiences of the people who came here from Europe and the rest of the world. The Glenbow takes several approaches. Most prominent is a large and brilliant gallery in which the Niitsitapi or Blackfoot people tell their own history. It’s worth the price of admission on its own.  In a nearby gallery is a multimedia installation by Kent Monkman, the Toronto artist of Cree ancestry, on the near extinction of the American bison during the 19th century because of overhunting by white settlers. But the representation of Indigenous people doesn’t stop there. Each of the museum’s other history galleries has a large panel offering “A First Nations Perspective” on a topic.  While reconciliation with Indigenous people remains more of a goal than a reality in Canada, the Glenbow and other museums are at least taking first steps. — Most Canadians know about skating on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa (crews began flooding its surface earlier this week only to have a thaw undo their efforts). And in recent years, the capital has been in a friendly competition with Winnipeg about which city has the longest or biggest or greatest skating trail. But while in Sudbury, Ontario, early this year, I discovered that it is also a hub of recreational skating. Not far from my hotel in the Little Britain neighborhood was the Queen’s Athletic Skating Oval. On the snowy evening when I wandered over, the wide and less than perfectly shaped oval, which is surfaced with a Zamboni, was disproportionately being enjoyed by novice adult skaters, many apparently newcomers to Canada as well as skates.  Then out by the campus of Laurentian University, about 1.5 kilometers of Ramsey Lake are cleared and flooded to create a skate path.  Alas, I hadn’t packed my skates before heading to Sudbury so I was only a spectator. — O.K., I was very late to this game but I finally made it to The Forks in Winnipeg this spring. Now arguably best known as the home of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, the former railway yard where the Red and Assiniboine Rivers meet has become Winnipeg’s meeting place. Despite somewhat chilly temperatures when I headed over for dinner on a weekday, the place was packed. But The Forks is not just about eating, shopping and entertainment. Throughout the site, Parks Canada presents its history in various novel ways. The wall beside a path sloping down to the water is lined with an archaeological timeline.  Many cities have projects similar in some aspects to The Forks. Few are as obviously successful. — This year, I returned to Lac Mégantic, Quebec. I was there six years ago when the explosions and fires set off by the derailment of a runaway oil train killed 47 people and incinerated the community’s lakeside downtown. I had gone back, along with photographer Ian Willms, as part of a series we call Promises Made that follows up on the aftermath of disasters. The short version is that I found the progress both on rail safety and the rebuilding of Lac Mégantic has been frustratingly slow. You can read the entire report here.  As they were during their time of crisis and despite the lingering trauma, the people I met in Lac Mégantic were hospitable and open. Because I drove from Ottawa, I brought a bike along. On the day I left town, I rose early to do a 56-kilometer-long variation of a ride around the lake that shares its name with the town. The “Grand Tour,” as it’s called on its route signs, was light on traffic and heavy on spectacular scenery.  Before the fire, tourism was one of Lac Mégantic’s major industries, along with the production of particle board used by Sweden’s most famous retailer to make bookcases and desks. The disaster, however, has kept many visitors away. The scenery, the parks, the lake, the camping, cycling and hiking remain as terrific as Lac Mégantic’s citizens remain welcoming. Pay them a visit if you can. L’Express, the Montreal bistro, is about to celebrate its 40th anniversary. But the food writer Brett Anderson writes that “it contains part of the source code for the approachable bistros and brasseries that have transformed American fine dining in the last 25 years.” For Travel, Mike Arnot looked into the electric powered seaplane now being tested by Harbour Air in Vancouver. “Someone was going to do it someday, so it may as well be us,” the small airline’s founder said.

Mexican Police Chief Arrested in Massacre of Mormon Family,2019-12-27,By Elisabeth Malkin,"['MEXICO CITY — The police chief of a small town near Mexico’s border with the United States has been arrested on suspicion that he was involved in the massacre of nine women and children of a Mormon family last month, the Mexican authorities said Friday. The federal authorities arrested Fidel Alejandro Villegas, the police chief in the town of Janos in the state of Chihuahua, as part of their investigation into the Nov. 4 attack in a remote region in the neighboring state of Sonora. Mr. Villegas was arrested this week on suspicion of protecting organized crime in the region and of colluding in the killings, a spokesman for Mexico’s Public Security Ministry said. He is the fourth person to be arrested on suspicion of participating in the murder of the three women and six children, members of a binational Mormon community that farms land in northern Mexico. The case has reverberated across the border, with President Trump once threatening to designate Mexican organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations.  The women and children, dual citizens of Mexico and the United States, were traveling in sports utility vehicles on a remote country road when they were attacked by gunmen believed to belong to an organized crime group. Federal officials have said that they are investigating the possibility that the victims were mistaken for members of a rival group. The F.B.I. has worked with the Mexican authorities in the investigation. Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the victims, said that the arrest of the Janos police chief confirms that Mexican law enforcement often collaborates with organized crime. “It’s common knowledge down here that the police work with the criminals,” he said by telephone from Chihuahua. “They have a monopoly on security and they get paid a wage for protection, and later we find out that they participate in the murder of women and children,” he said. “These people take resources to protect us and they are murderers themselves.” Mexico is about to close its most violent year on record, with 32,600 murders reported through November. The violence is proving to be the biggest challenge to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has centered his crime-fighting strategy around a new law enforcement agency, the National Guard, and promised that an emphasis on social policies would address the root causes of crime. But the National Guard proved to be of little help on the day the members of the extended LeBarón and Langford families were killed. The authorities did not arrive at the scene until 10 hours later, Mr. LeBarón said. “I’ve been marching in Mexico and speaking out against the violence,’’ he said. “And I have never seen a case where a victim has had justice.” Mr. LeBarón’s brother was killed 10 years ago when he stood up to local gangs and nobody has been tried for that crime, he said. “The justice system has collapsed,” he said. “The impunity rate is almost 100 percent.”']","The killings of three women and six children, members of a binational community that farms land in northern Mexico, reverberated worldwide."
Netanyahu’s Survival Is Tested as Likud Party Holds Leadership Vote,2019-12-26,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s political future on the line — and possibly Israel’s — members of his conservative Likud party voted Thursday on whether to stick with their scandal-scarred leader or replace him ahead of a general election in March. Mr. Netanyahu, who was indicted last month on corruption charges including bribery, was widely expected to prevail over his challenger, Gideon Saar, a seasoned but less popular party veteran.  Early Friday, Mr. Netanyahu declared victory. “A giant victory!” he said on Twitter just after midnight, before official results were in. “With the help of God and with your help, I will lead Likud to a great victory in the upcoming elections and we will continue to lead the country to unprecedented achievements,” he added. An exit poll late Thursday showed him winning more than 70 percent of the vote. The official result, expected to be known early Friday, will determine whether Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, will lead Likud into the country’s third parliamentary election in less than a year. The previous two general elections, in April and September, ended inconclusively and left the deeply divided nation in a political deadlock.  A clear win for Mr. Netanyahu would reaffirm his political survival skills and could energize his campaign for the March election, while a defeat would alter the landscape of Israeli politics and shake up that campaign.  The primary contest on Thursday was the most serious challenge to the prime minister’s party leadership since 2005. On Thursday, both candidates urged their supporters to brave the windy, rainy weather and turn out, each insisting that a big victory for him would lead to a big victory for the party on March 2. “For years I’ve been working as your emissary for our beloved country,” Mr. Netanyahu, 70, wrote in an appeal to the voters on Thursday morning. “Now I am asking for your support.” Soon after, in a Facebook Live post, he showed himself working the phones. Mr. Saar, 53, said he felt an awakening among the grass-roots. Voting in Tel Aviv, where he lives, he said, “We can win today and set off on a new path that will allow us to form a strong and stable government, that will allow us to unify the people of Israel — and that is the most important thing right now.”  About 116,000 paying Likud members are eligible to vote — a small fraction of those who vote for the party in general elections — and only about half have turned out for party primaries in the past. There were also fears of a low turnout because the vote is taking place during Hanukkah, when children are out of school. It was not clear which candidate would be helped by sparse turnout, but some people joked about whether Mr. Saar’s surname — Hebrew for “storm” — was an omen. The party said that about 49 percent of those eligible had voted.  At a campaign rally in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu had to be hustled off the stage to a safe area when an alert sounded, warning of a rocket launch from nearby Gaza. The military said a single rocket had been intercepted, and Mr. Netanyahu returned to the stage. A similar incident during the September election campaign was a leading factor in Israel’s assassination in November of Baha Abu al-Ata, an Islamic Jihad commander in Gaza, setting off a fierce, two-day cross-border clash.  Wednesday’s rocket attack provided an occasion for Mr. Netanyahu’s rivals in other parties to sting him. His chief opponent in the general election, Benny Gantz, a former army chief and leader of the centrist Blue and White party, described it as a “badge of shame” for the prime minister’s security policy in southern Israel. Mr. Saar has avoided attacking Mr. Netanyahu personally, avoiding mention of the indictment against him and leading what he hoped would be seen as a dignified campaign in a party that has traditionally prided itself on loyalty to its leader.  But as a hawkish technocrat, Mr. Saar has tried to outflank Mr. Netanyahu from the right, pledging to carry out annexation of territory in the occupied West Bank and other actions to bolster Israel’s settlement enterprise and land claims there — things that Mr. Netanyahu has also long promised but has avoided doing under international pressure. The charismatic, if polarizing, Mr. Netanyahu still commands a strong and emotional following and has brought Likud to power four times in the past. Mr. Saar’s main calling card is his clean image and the predictions, backed up by opinion polls, that with Mr. Netanyahu at the helm, the March election may do nothing to resolve Israel’s political logjam. “The Likudniks are going out to choose today between the past and the future,” Ben Caspit, a political columnist, wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Thursday, describing the voters’ choice as one “between the head and gut; between cold logic and the warm heart.”']",Israel’s prime minister declares victory over a challenger from within his own party. An exit poll gives him a wide lead.
Japanese Lawmaker Is Arrested in Casino Bribery Investigation,2019-12-25,By Ben Dooley,"['TOKYO — A member of Japan’s Parliament was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that wanted to build one of the first casinos in Japan, which legalized them just three years ago. Prosecutors arrested the lawmaker, Tsukasa Akimoto, of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, on allegations of accepting about $34,000 in cash and other gifts from the company, which was not identified in documents filed by prosecutors. Mr. Akimoto, who has yet to be formally charged, has denied wrongdoing. Parliament legalized casino gambling in 2016 despite public opposition, and Mr. Akimoto’s arrest could be a blow to the nascent industry. Lawmakers put significant restrictions on casino licensing to address concerns about the potential for money laundering and gambling addiction, and no casinos have yet opened. Documents filed by prosecutors outline a plan by three men associated with the unnamed company to secure Mr. Akimoto’s help with its project — building a casino on the northern island of Hokkaido — in exchange for gifts. All three men have been arrested. NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, reported that the company was 500.com, a Chinese company specializing in online sports betting. The company declined to comment on Wednesday. Mr. Akimoto, 48, is a member of the lower house of Parliament, where he was an advocate of legalizing casinos. Prosecutors say that the bribery occurred in 2017 and 2018, when he was a senior official at the country’s tourism ministry, overseeing efforts to develop the casino industry. Japanese prosecutors raided Mr. Akimoto’s office last week over suspicions that an associate had smuggled cash into the country. Before his arrest, Mr. Akimoto wrote on Twitter, “I have not participated in anything illegal at all.” He quit the Liberal Democratic Party on Wednesday. Also Wednesday, prosecutors searched the office of Takaki Shirasuka, a lawmaker from the same party, as part of the investigation, according to Kyodo News.  When lawmakers legalized casino gambling in 2016, they cited a need to stimulate Japan’s sluggish economy and find new sources of revenue. Some forms of gambling are legal in Japan, including lotteries and betting on certain kinds of races. And the authorities have long turned a blind eye to gambling in Japan’s ubiquitous pachinko parlors.  But the decision to allow blackjack, roulette and other table games into Japan opened up a potentially enormous new market for casino operators around the world. Analysts have said that it could be worth as much as $40 billion and rival Macau, China, as Asia’s gambling capital. The American companies MGM, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts joined competitors from China and Australia in jostling to enter Japan first.  To appease opponents of casino gambling — including Komeito, a Buddhist political party allied with the Liberal Democratic Party — legalization came with caveats. Casinos must be part of “integrated resorts” featuring other attractions, like hotels, shops and conference centers, and only three licenses would be granted, at least initially. NHK reported that Mr. Akimoto had traveled in December 2017 to the Chinese city of Shenzhen, where he met with representatives from 500.com. A few months later, he met with officials from a village in Hokkaido where the company hoped to develop a resort, it said. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, declined to answer questions about the case during a regular news conference on Wednesday, but he said there was no rule preventing officials from associating with industry representatives. He also said the government would “steadily progress” toward the goal of opening casinos. In November, Hokkaido announced that it would not pursue the development of an integrated resort for the time being, citing environmental concerns. That leaves Osaka and Yokohama, among other places, in the running to host the first three resorts. Final bid proposals are expected to be submitted to the government by early 2021.

Kazakhstan Plane Crash Kills at Least 12 People,2019-12-27,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — A passenger jet carrying 98 people crashed into a building shortly after takeoff from Almaty International Airport in Kazakhstan on Friday morning, killing at least 12 people and injuring scores more. The crash of the Bek Air plane was the latest aviation tragedy to befall a former Soviet republic, a region plagued by a still-checkered safety record even as passenger numbers increase with the proliferation of low-cost carriers like Bek, a small Kazakh airline.  The accident heightened fears about air travel in Kazakhstan and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a group that includes most of the former Soviet Union — and that ranks worst in the world for its incidence of major accidents, according to the International Air Transport Association.  In Russia, another member of the C.I.S., the crash renewed talk about the country’s own aviation problems. The Bek Air accident follows a fiery emergency landing by an Aeroflot plane in Moscow in May, killing 41 people, and a Saratov Airlines crash outside Moscow last year that killed all 71 people aboard. In Almaty, most of the passengers survived, the Kazakh authorities said. There were conflicting reports on the total number of people on board, but the Health Ministry, in a statement, eventually fixed the numbers at 93 passengers and five crew members. Photographs carried by Kazakh news outlets showed the fuselage of the passenger jet ripped to pieces in the snow amid the rubble of a building. Rescue workers combed the wreckage. In one photo, emergency workers were seen picking through the debris — a red suitcase, a building’s window frame and pieces of the aircraft. At 7:22 a.m., the plane, a Dutch-made Fokker 100, bound for Nur-Sultan, the Kazakh capital, lost altitude and crashed into a two-story building in a residential area near the airport, officials said.  Eight people were confirmed dead at the scene, two more while being treated at the airport and another two after being taken to a hospital, officials said. Ten people were reported hospitalized in critical condition. A surviving passenger, Aslan Nazaraliyev, 34, said he was watching the TV show “Billions” in an aisle seat in row 15 when the plane started “rocking like a boat” as it gained altitude after takeoff. Then, he said, it started shaking violently and people on board started to panic, even as the craft continued to climb. About a minute later, “the flight got out of control,” like a car skidding on ice, Mr. Nazaraliyev, a businessman whose company makes professional cleaning supplies, said in a phone interview. The plane started to fall at an angle before it made impact some 20 seconds later, he said, slamming into a two-story building, pieces of which rained down to the ground. A man and woman to his right opened the emergency exit and clambered out, slipping and falling on the plane’s icy wing. Guided by their smartphone flashlights and by people’s moans, Mr. Nazaraliyev and others dragged the injured people away from the plane for fear it would catch fire. “Where is the ambulance?” a woman can be heard saying on a video from the scene circulated by the Kazakh news media. “People are asking for an ambulance and it’s not arriving.” In another video, apparently filmed about 20 minutes after the crash, people can be heard moaning and screaming. No emergency workers can be seen. “We’re taking them out on our own and helping on our own,” a man says.  Among the dead, Interfax reported, were the plane’s 38-year-old captain, Marat Muratbayev; an editor for a Kazakh news outlet, Dana Kruglova, who was 35; and a prominent Kazakh major general, Rustem Kaydarov, 79. Mr. Nazaraliyev said he was unharmed in the crash. After rescue workers arrived, he got a ride back to the same airport from which he had just departed and then took a cab home. He said that some survivors asked if they would get their tickets refunded and when they would get their luggage back. “I said, ‘Guys, you should be happy you’re alive,’” Mr. Nazaraliyev recalled. Almaty, in southeastern Kazakhstan near the mountainous border with Kyrgyzstan, is the Central Asian country’s biggest city.  The Kazakh authorities have halted flights of the Fokker 100, a twin-engine model built in the 1980s and ’90s, news agencies reported, citing the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development.  The authorities were investigating pilot error or technical problems as possible causes of the crash, Deputy Prime Minister Roman Sklyar said. The plane’s tail twice touched the runway as it was taking off, Mr. Sklyar said, according to Russia’s Tass state news agency. “We don’t know where the Fokker 100 is,” an air traffic controller told another airliner after the Bek Air flight took off, according to a recording published by Kazakh news outlets.  Bek Air, which was Kazakhstan’s first low-cost airline, operated seven Fokker 100 jets and flies to 12 Kazakh destinations as well as Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia. A brief statement from the airline offered condolences and warned Kazakhs about the risk of fraudsters taking advantage of the tragedy. The accident is the second major deadly commercial aviation accident in the former Soviet Union this year, after the Aeroflot accident  in Moscow.  The crashes highlighted a history of problems in regional air travel as documented by the International Air Transport Association. In 2018, the C.I.S. region saw 1.19 aircraft losses per one million departures, compared to zero in Europe, Africa, and North America and 0.32 in the Asia-Pacific region. From 2013 to 2017, the C.I.S. ranked second worst, just ahead of Africa. A mass-market Russian tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, published an interview with an airline safety expert, Valery Shelkovnikov, who said Russian aviation employees shied away from reporting problems. “People are still afraid of everything,” Mr. Shelkovnikov said. “What if the bosses find out?” The last major commercial airline crash in Kazakhstan, which has a relatively small airline market, was in 2013, when a SCAT Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 regional jet went down outside Almaty, killing all 21 on board.  Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, declared Saturday a national day of mourning and ordered all entertainment events to be canceled across the country. In an emergency meeting at his residence, Mr. Tokayev called for checks on all airlines and air travel infrastructure in the country and directed the authorities to examine the legality of constructing buildings in the immediate vicinity of the Almaty airport. “All the guilty will be punished severely in accordance with the law,” Mr. Tokayev said on Twitter. Production on the Fokker 100 ceased in 1997, after the plane’s Dutch manufacturer went into bankruptcy a year earlier. Though many airlines have retired the aircraft, more than 100 are still active, mostly in Australia and Iran, and a well-maintained airliner can remain in service for more than 30 years; the plane involved in Friday’s crash was nearly 24 years old. The plane is almost 117 feet long and can carry up to 109 passengers.  In July this year, a Fokker 100 flying for Virgin Australia suffered engine failure after taking off from an airport in Western Australia. Crew members tried to restart the left engine after it began to fail as the aircraft was climbing, said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is investigating the incident. They could not restart the engine, but were able to fly to their destination 260 miles away. The plane landed safely with no injuries reported. A report on the investigation is expected in the first few months of the new year. And last month, a Fokker 100 flying for Alliance Airlines lost speed preparing to land at Rockhampton Airport in the Australian state of Queensland, the safety bureau said. The craft ran into turbulence on its final approach and fell below the minimum approach speed. It landed safely, but the authorities were scrutinizing technical logs and recorded data and interviewing crew members. A report is expected next year. The Fokker 100 is still sought after for its durability. “The Fokker 100 is a very, very good plane, properly maintained,” said Geoffrey Thomas, editor in chief of Airlineratings.com. “They work in the most harsh environments around the clock.” Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow, and Daniel Victor and Jamie Tarabay from Hong Kong.']","The crash in Almaty, the latest to befall a former Soviet republic, highlighted the region’s checkered air safety history.

"Iranians Honor Dead Protesters, Amid Vows to Fight On",2019-12-26,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Forty days after the first protesters were killed in Iran’s worst unrest in decades, Iranians took their grievances against the government to cemeteries on Thursday, marking both the end of the traditional mourning period and their determination not to back down. Over four days of protests in November, security forces shot and killed up to 450 people, human rights organizations estimate, and in the weeks leading up to Thursday, some of their survivors called on the public to join them in yet another act of defiance: at the graveyards of their loved ones. Iran’s leadership was not having it. Even before the end of the mourning period, the authorities began cracking down, beefing up security in cities across the country, renewing their disruption of the internet and conducting waves of pre-emptive arrests. Then on Thursday, uniformed security forces and plainclothes militia deployed en masse across the country to keep people off the streets. They lined up on foot in riot gear at squares, and paraded through residential and commercial neighborhoods in platoons of motorcycles and armored vehicles carrying the Iranian flag and waving weapons, video shared on social media showed. “Tehran is under total calm and security,” Tehran’s chief of police, Brig. Gen. Hossein Rahimi, declared Thursday. “Our enemies are constantly trying to instigate chaos and instability, but they will be met with the security forces’ iron fist.” Accounts and videos that emerged from the country despite the information clampdown suggested, however, that Iranian protesters made their presence known, if generally in small groups, at cemeteries and in the streets of several cities, including Karaj, Isfahan, Mashhad, Behbahan, Malard, Najafabad, Yazdan Shahr and Shahriar. There were unconfirmed reports of 50 arrests. They gathered to honor the dead, and as they did so, some chanted slogans against Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling him a “murderer” and a “criminal.” “We didn’t give casualties to praise a murderous leader,” chanted one group of men and women who gathered at the grave of Pouya Bakhtiari, a 27-year-old engineer who was shot and killed in November and has become one of the main faces of the uprising. Mr. Bakhtiari’s parents were detained this week after refusing, under pressure from the government, to call off their invitation for the public to join their son’s memorial service. On Thursday, a crowd managed to gather briefly at Mr. Bakhtiari’s grave and lay flowers, candles and a handwritten sign that read, “Lost his life for bread, employment and freedom.” Witnesses reported that security forces ordered family members to leave, chased supporters away, arrested several people and cordoned off Mr. Bakhtiari’s grave. They blocked cars from entering the cemetery and positioned water cannons and armored cars around the grave site, according to reports on social media. “I was counting the days to go to my grandson’s grave and pray,” Mr. Bakhtiari’s grandmother said in a video message on Thursday to BBC Persian television. “I begged a lot and I cried, and I said, ‘Please allow me to go for one minute to pray.’ But they didn’t let me.” Word of the Bakhtiari family detentions drew condemnation from the American secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. “The U.S. strongly denounces the arrest of Pouya Bakhtiari’s parents, and calls for their immediate release,” he said on Twitter. The protests, which began on Nov. 15, broke out hours after the government raised gasoline prices by 200 percent. Already struggling under the burden of economic sanctions imposed by the United States, Iranians took to the streets in what became the broadest unrest seen in the country in decades. The government’s response was unsparing. As cities across Iran were convulsed in the days after the gas-price increase, some 300 to 450 people are believed to have been killed. At least 2,000 others were reported injured, and 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists. Iran has dismissed those figures as exaggerated, but it has not released its own, despite calls for transparency by lawmakers from across the political spectrum. On Thursday, one video posted on social media showed a platoon of armed forces marching in the street chanting “Haydar,” a rallying cry for war, but a man narrating the video sounded scornful. “It’s because they are afraid,” he said. Mr. Khamenei initially denounced the protesters as rioters, thugs, monarchists and enemy agents, but when public fury mounted over the heavy-handed crackdown, he called for “Islamic mercy” for people who had simply demonstrated against the price increase. President Hassan Rouhani said a government committee would investigate the unrest and propose compensation for Iranians who lost loved ones or suffered financial loss. But Iran watchers believe the cycle of protest and crackdown may persist, given the anger among many Iranians over the economy. The United States reimposed the sanctions after the Trump administration pulled out of a multination deal intended to thwart Iran’s nuclear program. On Thursday, supporters and opponents of the regime alike reviewed the events of the day and declared victory, at least of sorts. Posting on social media, government supporters took satisfaction in the failure of protesters to assemble crowds as large as those in November. Opponents said the authorities’ heavy deployment of force showed that they feared their own citizens. “Dec. 26 is the latest proof that regime change is delusional and a farce,” Morteza Avini, a conservative filmmaker, wrote on Twitter. Kambiz Hosseini, an expatriate political satirist, offered a different lesson to the government. “These days will end,” he wrote. “The people will take the country back, and you will be begging for forgiveness.”']","Defying a heavy government show of force, Iranians mourned fellow citizens killed during the unrest."
"Turkey Is Close to Sending Troops to Libya, Erdogan Says",2019-12-26,By Declan Walsh,"['Turkey moved closer to a major military intervention in Libya’s escalating civil war on Thursday, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a parliamentary vote that could send troops in a matter of weeks to support the embattled government of the North African country. Mr. Erdogan wants to counter the Russian-backed forces of the militia leader Khalifa Hifter, who have put the Libyan capital, Tripoli, under siege since April.  Tripoli residents said Thursday that the Russian support appeared to be accelerating the advance of Mr. Hifter’s forces into the city. Although the size of the planned deployment is unclear, it would signal a far greater role for Turkey — and for Mr. Erdogan — in a chaotic war that had already become a proxy battle among regional powers. Mr. Erdogan, whose government has supplied armored vehicles and drones to the United Nations-recognized government of Libya, said in early December that his country might send troops, too. But as recently as Wednesday, when he met with Libyan and Tunisian officials in Tunis, he also said that Turkey would intervene only at the request of the government in Tripoli. On Thursday, he said that a request had come and that Turkey’s Parliament, which his party controls, would consider it on Jan. 8 or 9. “We do not go where we are not invited. Right now, there is an invitation that we will respond to,” Mr. Erdogan told a meeting of his governing party in Ankara, Turkey’s capital. “If God permits, as soon as the Parliament opens, as the first thing to do, we will present the deployment of troops resolution to our Parliament.” It was unclear, though, whether the Libyan government actually had formally invited Turkey to send troops. Speaking in Tunis, Libya’s interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, told reporters on Thursday that the government would request help if the situation deteriorated further.  “If the situation escalates then we have the right to defend Tripoli and its residents,” Mr. Bashagha said, according to Reuters.  Since the 2011 rebellion that toppled and killed the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya has been battered and fragmented by factional fighting. Mr. Hifter, a former officer in Colonel el-Qaddafi’s military, spent years trying to overthrow him, including during a long period living in the United States. Mr. Hifter, who styles himself as a strongman who can restore order to Libya, is backed by the United Arab Emirates and by Egypt, and has received help from France.  On Thursday, President Trump spoke about the war in Libya with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, the White House said in a statement. The presidents “rejected foreign exploitation and agreed that parties must take urgent steps to resolve the conflict before Libyans lose control to foreign actors,” the statement said, without specifying those actors.  The White House declined to say anything further on the record, but confirmed on background that the reference to “foreign actors” included Russia. In Libya, Mr. Hifter’s forces suffered a major setback in June with the loss of a base south of Tripoli, but their fortunes were revived in recent months by the arrival of Russian mercenaries bringing concerted artillery support and sniper fire, all with the Kremlin’s blessing. “All those are helping a warlord, but we are responding to an invitation of the country’s legitimate government,” Mr. Erdogan said. “This is our difference.” The Libyan government led by Fayez al-Sarraj has defended itself in Tripoli, but as the battle has deepened in recent months, it has become increasingly reliant on Mr. Erdogan’s backing for survival. On Saturday, the Turkish Parliament ratified a new security and military cooperation deal with Mr. al-Sarraj’s government. “We have given and will give all forms of support to the Tripoli government,” Mr. Erdogan said. Michael Shear contributed reporting from Washington.']","The Turkish president said his country’s Parliament would soon vote on a deployment, adding to an escalating proxy battle among regional powers.

The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in January,2019-12-27,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for January, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘The Post’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 Produced quickly in response to the escalating tensions between the press and the Trump administration, Steven Spielberg’s political thriller makes a strong case for the mainstream media as a bulwark of democracy in dark political times. “The Post” spells that thesis out a bit too explicitly at times, but when it focuses on the nuts and bolts of the Washington Post editor in chief Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) and his team publishing the Pentagon Papers despite White House objections, it belongs in the conversation with classics like “All the President’s Men.” Meryl Streep does standout work as Katharine Graham, the paper’s new publisher, who has to fend off the same D.C. elites she entertains at parties. ‘Game Night’ Starts streaming: Jan. 4 Rachel McAdams cuts loose in this hugely entertaining comedy about a competitive married couple (McAdams and Jason Bateman) whose regular game night among friends turns into a life-or-death situation. It begins innocently enough with her megasuccessful brother-in-law (Kyle Chandler) inviting the group over for an interactive role-playing mystery game, but when assailants break into the house and take him away, nobody realizes he’s been abducted for real. “Game Night” keeps them in the dark for a while, leading to one hilarious bit in which McAdams re-enacts a scene from “Pulp Fiction,” and it stays funny when they’re thrust into a chaotic nocturnal adventure. ‘Captain America: The First Avenger’ Starts streaming: Jan. 25 One criticism of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies is that all of them look the same, forced to conform to a common template so the various superheroes can come together in crossovers and team-ups. “Captain America: The First Avenger” is one of the few exceptions, thanks to its director, Joe Johnston, who has always been a high-quality Steven Spielberg mimic (he directed “Jurassic Park III”) and who gives the World War II section of the film a distinct visual panache. Chris Evans enters the MCU as Steve Rogers, an eager World War II recruit who agrees to take part in a “super-soldier” experiment if it can help the war effort. The experiment works all too well. ‘Frères Ennemis’ Starts streaming: Jan. 29 Picked up by Netflix after drawing strong reviews at the Venice Film Festival in September, David Oelhoffen’s French crime drama, translated as “Close Enemies,” details the divergent paths of two men who grew up friends in a rough Paris banlieue — one has become a narcotics officer, the other part of a drug syndicate. The twist in “Frères Ennemis” is that the surrogate families that surround these men are not what one might assume: The drug dealer (Matthias Schoenaerts) is part of a warm and loyal clan while the officer (Reda Kateb) lives out his more respectable life in relative isolation. Their paths intersect in complex and explosive ways. ‘Uncut Gems’ Starts streaming: Jan. 31 In Josh and Benny Safdie’s bleeding ulcer of a thriller, Adam Sandler stars as a Diamond District store owner whose gambling addiction has put him in mortal danger with the criminal element. His chances of betting his way out of hock are remote, but he sees an opportunity to climb out of debt when he purchases an uncut opal from an Ethiopian mine with the hope of auctioning it off for hundreds of thousands of dollars. A visit from the former Boston Celtics center Kevin Garnett (playing himself, convincingly) alters his plans, as do huge bets placed with a bookie (Mike Francesa) and with the Mohegan Sun casino. The Safdies stage his wheeling and dealing with relentless pace and an acrid sense of humor. ‘Messiah’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 What if the Second Coming happened in our modern world? That’s the question asked by this sure-to-be-controversial series about a serene miracle worker (Mehdi Dehbi) who materializes in the Middle East and gathers a devoted following, but opinions vary on whether he’s a savior or a con artist. Michelle Monaghan stars as the C.I.A. officer assigned to the case, and the supporting cast is loaded with familiar faces like Jane Adams, Beau Bridges and Philip Baker Hall. Mark Burnett and Roma Downey are among the executive producers, and given their past sponsorship of faith-based projects like “The Bible” and “Son of God,” a Christian bent seems likely. ‘Spinning Out’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 Older generations might remember the 1978 sports drama “Ice Castles,” about a figure skater who is blinded in a terrible accident and miraculously returns to the sport with a partner/love interest. This new series looks like a similar story, only a much hipper, more hard-edge version, with Kaya Scodelario starring as an Olympic-level talent who abruptly exits the competition track after a head injury, but makes a comeback alongside a bad-boy pairs skater (Evan Roderick). The heightened theatrics of the trailer make “Spinning Out” look like a camp thriller, with “Mad Men” ice queen January Jones as Scodelario’s disapproving mother and a role for the real-life skater Johnny Weir. ‘The Circle’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 It wasn’t long ago that Dave Eggers wrote a book called “The Circle” that warned of the dark side of Silicon Valley, focusing on a cultish invasiveness of a Google-like corporate campus. It was even less long ago that Eggers’s book was turned into a disastrous flop with Tom Hanks and Emma Watson. And now the title has been claimed, without a hint of self-awareness, by this reality competition series, which cheerfully accepts an online discourse where identity and accountability are totally up for grabs. “The Circle” mixes the surveillance-cam aesthetics of “Big Brother” with the sinister twists of “Catfish,” with contestants who all live in the same apartment building but communicate with one another only through an app. The last one not to get “blocked” wins. ‘Cheer’ Starts streaming: Jan. 8 Fans of the addictive junior-college football series “Last Chance U” can expect a similar approach to this six-episode documentary series from the same creator, Greg Whiteley, about the unusually dominant competitive cheerleading squad at Navarro College in Corsicana, Tex. The Navarro cheerleaders have won 14 national championships since 2000, so expectations are high that they will win another in the year “Cheer” follows them around, but the pressure to win, along with injuries and other setbacks, makes it a stressful run. As with “Last Chance U,” Whiteley tries to bear down on the particulars of the sport while getting to know these athletes off the field, too. ‘AJ and the Queen’ Starts streaming: Jan. 10 Despite some bit appearances in movies and fictional shows over the years, the drag queen icon RuPaul is best known for appearing on television shows like the reality-TV hit “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” The new series “AJ and the Queen,” which he conceived with the frequent “Sex and the City” writer/director Michael Patrick King, gives him a chance to play off his irreverent persona while honing his dramatic chops. He stars here as Ruby Red, a cash-poor drag queen who travels across the country in a beat-up R.V., accompanied by  an 11-year-old orphan stowaway (Izzy G.). The pair get more than a few looks as they make their way through the heartland. ‘Giri/Haji’ Starts streaming: Jan. 10 After debuting to strong reviews on the BBC, this eight-part cross-cultural British mini-series comes to Netflix to fill a seemingly endless appetite for crime stories among subscribers. Set between London and Tokyo, “Giri/Haji” (translated as Duty/Shame) starts with a Japanese detective (Takehiro Hira) who travels to London to search for his missing brother, who’s a member of the Yakuza. Once he arrives in the U.K., he gets help from a detective constable (Kelly Macdonald) and a half-Japanese prostitute (Will Sharpe), but these unlikely allies face a much thicker plot than they might have imagined. ‘Medical Police’ Starts streaming: Jan. 10 The creators of “Childrens Hospital” parody international espionage thrillers with this extended goof about doctors-turned-government agents who try to find the source of a virus that threatens to wipe out civilization. Erinn Hayes and Rob Huebel star as American physicians in a São Paulo hospital who discover the virus and get recruited by a secret spy organization to find the cure while unmasking the conspiracy responsible. Other “Childrens Hospital” regulars are cast here, too — including Rob Corddry, Malin Åkerman, Ken Marino and Lake Bell — so it’s reasonable to expect the tongue-in-cheek absurdity of that show to carry over into this one. ‘Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts’ Starts streaming: Jan. 14 Though heavily influenced by the sharp angles, vibrant colors and exaggerated character design of Japanese animation, “Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts” was created through DreamWorks by one of its artisans, Radford Sechrist, and includes Sterling K. Brown, Dan Stevens, Joan Jett, John Hodgman and RZA among its eclectic voice talents. Karen Fukuhara voices Kipo, a young girl who is among the human survivors of an apocalyptic event that has turned other living things into enormous and intelligent creatures, pushing people far down the evolutionary chain. She and a handful of humans and friendly surface-dwellers band together to find her father and others missing from her underground city. ‘Next in Fashion’ Starts streaming: Jan. 29 The venerable “Project Runway” is currently on its 18th season and counting, but without Heidi Klum as host and Tim Gunn as mentor, there must be enough blood in the water for another fashion competition show to seize the spotlight. The “Queer Eye” favorite Tan France and the designer/model Alexa Chung are co-hosting “Next in Fashion,” which puts 18 designers through various challenges to determine a winner, but the tight 10-episode run will ramp up the hourly casualties. The winner gets $250,000 and a collection showcased by the retailer Net-a-Porter, which is a larger-than-usual carrot at the end of the stick. ‘The Stranger’ Starts streaming: Jan. 30 The team behind the Netflix crime drama “Safe” from 2018 — the novelist Harlan Coben and Red Production Company — returns with an eight-episode adaptation of Coben’s novel “The Stranger.” Richard Armitage stars as a normal guy with a healthy marriage and two sons whose life turns to shambles when a stranger sits next to him at a bar and tells him a secret that sets him on a destabilizing course. How this stranger’s words could upend the lives of anyone who hears them is a mystery the series will explore, leading its hero to a sinister conspiracy that threatens harm to himself and others. ‘Bojack Horseman Season 6 (Part B)’ Starts streaming: Jan. 31 After a three-month breather, “Bojack Horseman” returns with the last eight episodes of its six-season run, which has evolved from an offbeat comedy about a has-been equine entertainer (voiced by Will Arnett) to a character study that’s chased its laughs with serious insight into addiction, depression and various existential crises. The first part of season six caught Bojack at a low point, struggling to clean himself up after getting hooked on painkillers and alcohol, and assaulting a co-star. The second part will continue his road to recovery, but characters and incidents from his past are sure to create a few speed bumps. The miracle of the show is how much it incorporates these difficult life events without losing its sense of humor. Also of interest: “American Graffiti” (Jan. 1), “Definitely, Maybe” (Jan. 1), “Sex, Explained: Limited Series” (Jan. 2), “Thieves of the Wood” (Jan. 2), “Grace and Frankie: Season 6” (Jan. 15), “Sex Education: Season 2” (Jan. 17), “Tyler Perry’s A Fall From Grace” (Jan. 17), “The Queen” (Jan. 23), “The Ranch: The Final Season” (Jan. 24), “I Am a Killer: Season 2” (Jan. 31).']","This month’s new additions include “The Post” with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks; “Uncut Gems,” starring Adam Sandler; and “AJ and the Queen,” featuring RuPaul."
"Tourists Drowned at Pool in Spain Because They Couldn’t Swim, Police Say",2019-12-27,By Mark A. Walsh,"['LONDON — The deaths of a father and two children who drowned in a swimming pool at a resort in southern Spain this week were “a tragic accident” that came about because none of the victims knew how to swim, the authorities said on Friday, in a conclusion that was quickly challenged by a family member. The victims, including a 9-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, were tourists on a family vacation at a resort in Mijas, in the Costa del Sol.  The family’s three children, including the two who died and a 14-year-old girl, had been bathing in the shallow end of a pool at about 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday while their parents sunbathed, according to a statement by the Civil Guard, a Spanish police force.  The 9-year-old at some point moved into deeper water and could not get out. Her brother, the 16-year-old, tried to help but then found himself also in trouble, prompting the father to jump in, the statement said. None of the three could swim, the police said. A church in Britain, the Redeemed Christian Church of God, said in a statement that the victims included a pastor, Gabriel Diya, 52, who had worked at Open Heavens, a branch of the organization in Charlton, southeastern London, along with one of his daughters, Comfort Diya, and his son, Praise-Emmanuel Diya.  Mr. Diya’s wife, Olubunmi, said in a statement Friday that all three knew how to swim. She said that the children had used steps to enter the pool, “but found themselves dragged into the middle, which was deeper and called for help when they could not get out.” “I believe something was wrong with the pool that must have made swimming difficult for them at that point in time,” she said. “By the time assistance came, the three of them were under the water.” She added that investigations by the Spanish police were “still ongoing.” The father and daughter were British citizens and the teenage son was American, the authorities said. The five members of the family were said to have arrived at the resort, the Club La Costa World, on Sunday. “He was a loving husband and devoted father,” the statement from the church said. “He was also a humble, friendly and committed pastor and Christian leader.” Jorge Martín, a spokesman for the civil guard in Spain, said by telephone on Friday that the water was about six and a half feet deep at the pool’s deepest point.  An initial report that a resort employee who entered the pool during the episode had also struggled to get out suggested that there might have been a problem with the pool’s filtration or drainage systems, Mr. Martín said. That led to suspicions that a malfunction might have sucked the three victims underwater, but the police statement said that investigators had checked the equipment at the resort and found no problems.  Mr. Martín said the employee had clarified that he had had trouble exiting the pool because he was trying to retrieve the bodies. Samples of the water were also taken and were being analyzed, the statement said, but autopsies found no evidence of chemical intoxication and ruled the cause of deaths as drowning. The civil guard said that the deaths were “a tragic accident caused by the victims’ lack of expertise in swimming when they found themselves in a deep area of the pool where they could not put their feet down.” The operator of the resort, CLC World Resorts and Hotels, said that the company was providing care and support to the family and other guests. The authorities “have carried out a full investigation and gave formal permissions to reopen the pool as they found no concerns relating to the pool or procedures in place,” the company said in a statement. Experts warn that even if children are confident in the water, vigilance is needed whenever they go swimming. For those who cannot swim competently, arm’s-length supervision is recommended. Nicole Hughes, a teacher in Tennessee, has been an advocate for legislation to provide more barriers around pools since her 3-year-old son, Levi, drowned while on vacation in Alabama in 2018. She told The New York Times in July that it was frighteningly simple for accidents to happen. “We took water safety very seriously — if you’d given me a list of 1,000 reasons one of my kids would die, drowning would have been the 1,000th,” Ms. Hughes said at the time. The numbers back up the warnings. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 people die in the United States by accidental drowning every day, two of them children under 14.']","A father and two children, ages 9 and 16, who died in a pool at a resort on the Costa del Sol, found themselves in deep water and unable to get out, the authorities said."
Netanyahu Won Over His Party. Can He Win Over Israel?,2019-12-27,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — After failing to form a government twice in two tries, then being hit with a bribery charge, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s long rule over Israel appeared set to expire. But in his first real test since his indictment last month in three corruption cases, Mr. Netanyahu crushed a lone rival Thursday for the leadership of his conservative Likud party and, like a political phoenix, rose to fight another day. “I received a renewed and huge mandate from the Likud yesterday,” he said in a victory speech on Friday, hours after the final tally was in. “The future is in our hands.” With his landslide victory in the Likud party primary election, Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and a famed political survivor, has reasserted his grip over the party in spite of his legal troubles, fired up his base and reinvigorated his campaign ahead of the next general election in early March. The election will be the third in a year, an unprecedented situation as a deeply polarized Israel struggles to form a government after inconclusive elections in April and September. The questions many Israelis were asking Friday were whether the die-hard Netanyahu fans who came out to vote for him on a wet, blustery day reflect wider support on the Israeli right, whether Mr. Netanyahu can maintain his fresh momentum for another two months, and whether anything could jolt a hung electorate out of its political logjam. “The primary injected enthusiasm and got the Likud machine working,” said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “But can that buzz be maintained over months? I’m not sure.” Mr. Netanyahu trounced his party rival, Gideon Saar, winning 72.5 percent of the vote. Still, just under half the 116,000 eligible dues-paying Likud members cast ballots, meaning that about 41,000 Netanyahu adherents — a tiny fraction of the total Israeli electorate of about 6.4 million voters — may have locked the country into another round of political paralysis. The previous two elections ended in a draw between Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing-religious coalition and the center-left bloc led by Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief, with neither able to form a majority coalition. Recent polls before the Likud primary showed Mr. Netanyahu’s support softening after his indictment but not enough to change the unforgiving math that has paralyzed the Israeli government for the past year. Moderate conservatives concerned about upholding the rule of law may find it difficult to vote for Mr. Netanyahu, Ms. Talshir said, noting that in more educated, well-heeled districts like north Tel Aviv,  Mr. Saar made a strong showing. The one likely outcome of Mr. Netanyahu’s new lease on political life is that the March 2 election will again be ugly and divisive, analysts said. It will pit the “Only Bibi” camp of supporters, who lovingly call Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname, attack the law enforcement authorities and try to delegitimize any opposition, against the other Israel that cannot accept the idea of a prime minister facing prosecution for serious crimes. Mr. Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White party, made it clear on Friday that he will once again run as the “not Bibi” candidate. “It appears that the defendant Netanyahu, who is leading the state of Israel down a path of corruption, will continue to lead Likud,” Mr. Gantz said in response to the primary results. “These elections demand that we place a mirror in front of the ‘Netanyahu party’ and make the choice for unity, dignity and internal reconciliation,” he added. But with the same protagonists running again on the same issues, and with recent polls showing a similar deadlock, there is little expectation of a fundamental shake-up by the March election. “The people who don’t like Netanyahu still won’t like him,” said Israel Bachar, a strategist for the Blue and White campaign, dismissing any notion that the primary result could have a wider impact. “It won’t change the polling data.” What the primary did do is remove any doubt about Mr. Netanyahu’s hold over his party and his ministers, Mr. Bachar said, “and that’s a good change for him.” While Mr. Netanyahu focuses on his legal issues, he added, Mr. Gantz will focus on values. Mr. Netanyahu is accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls for illicit gifts of cigars, champagne and jewelry, as well as positive news coverage. He has denied any wrongdoing, casting himself as the victim of a witch hunt by a left-wing elite that he says dominates the news media and has pressed the law enforcement authorities to pursue criminal investigations against him. For his loyalists, the primary triumph clears a possible path ahead for Mr. Netanyahu. Miki Zohar, Likud’s chief whip in Parliament, said on television that the result is basically telling Mr. Netanyahu that his Likud voters want him to request parliamentary immunity from prosecution. Mr. Netanyahu has a few days left before the deadline for submitting such a request, though it would likely only be voted on if and when a new government is formed after the election. Approval would depend on Mr. Netanyahu’s being able to muster a majority of 61 in the 120-seat Parliament. That will mean getting out every last Likud and right-wing voter. In Jerusalem’s bustling Mahane Yehuda market, an old Likud bastion, some of the vendors reverently display fading portraits of Likud’s founder, Menachem Begin, a stickler for the rule of law, in their shops. One of them, Avraham Levy, 69, who voted for Mr. Netanyahu in the primary, said it was “not easy to find someone like him in our generation” as he sold fruit on Friday. He dismissed the charges against Mr. Netanyahu, saying, “It’s not bribery in my eyes so long as he didn’t take money.” Crediting the prime minister with the country’s strong economy and security, he said, “You don’t exchange a horse for a donkey. We have a good horse.” “Of course I’m a Likudnik,” exclaimed Shmuel Rosemarine, 30, who was working at his family’s dried fruit and nuts store. “Is there anything else? I’m for Bibi, and only Bibi. Nobody can replace him.” Yossi Verter, a political columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, cautioned that the love poured on Mr. Netanyahu by his party faithful may have no bearing at all on the March election. He cited the 1999 Likud primary, which Mr. Netanyahu won by an even greater margin before going on to a stinging defeat in the general election. “The only relevant conclusion today,” Mr. Verter wrote on Friday, “is that what happens in Likud stays in Likud.” ']","Handing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a victory in a Likud leadership primary, a tiny fraction of voters may have prolonged Israel’s political deadlock.

A Country Where Driving Makes You a Target,2019-12-26,By David Zucchino,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — After Shir Mohammad Panjshiri shoveled a final spadeful of dirt onto his brother’s grave, he left the cemetery burdened with questions.  His brother, Aziz Ahmad Panjshiri, a retired college professor, had been abducted from a car in northern Afghanistan on Nov. 5. He was later shot dead, his body dumped in a neighboring province. His grieving brother still did not know why. “What happened to my brother isn’t clear,” Mr. Panjshiri said after Professor Panjshiri, 69, was buried on a Kabul hillside. “We’re waiting for the government to tell us.” Afghan roads are some of the most dangerous in the world, turned into killing grounds through years of bitter guerrilla warfare. Off-duty police officers and soldiers, judges, government officials, human rights workers, businessmen, prosecutors — all have been killed on highways in Afghanistan’s rugged countryside. Often, Taliban insurgents claim responsibility for ambushing representatives of the Afghan government. But in other cases, like the killing of Professor Panjshiri, families are left wondering whether their loved ones were killed by insurgents, thieves, kidnappers or someone else — and why. There are so many ways to be killed simply for traveling here. Each day, Afghans are killed by suicide blasts, roadside bombs, checkpoint ambushes and airstrikes. People plan their routes carefully, sometimes seeking protection from government security forces who are not always up to the task. Provincial roadways have strategic value. The Taliban attack travelers to demonstrate that the government cannot protect its citizens. They put up checkpoints in areas they control. Government security forces fight to keep roadways open. But they frequently hunker down on their bases, leaving long stretches of road as no man’s lands where travelers risk their lives. Because only provincial capitals are typically served by commercial airlines, local roads are the only way for many residents to reach jobs, family members and markets. Many flights are fully booked as people opt not to drive. Two days after Professor Panjshiri was killed, three judges and a court clerk traveling to Kabul, the capital, were shot dead by gunmen in eastern Afghanistan. A week earlier, a man who worked for a C.I.A.-backed government strike force was shot dead in his car in southern Afghanistan in front of his 3-year-old daughter, who survived. In September, a provincial deputy of the country’s Independent Human Rights Commission was abducted and killed while driving in central Afghanistan. And in November, a prosecutor was shot dead in a car in eastern Afghanistan. No one claimed responsibility for those ambushes, but provincial government officials blamed the Taliban in three of the cases. The three judges had not coordinated their trip with security forces, said Major Rahme Khuda Mukhlis, the police chief in Logar Province, where the men were killed.  Fazal Qadir Qenaat, the head of the appellate court in neighboring Paktia Province, where the judges worked, said he had tried to persuade them not to make the dangerous drive. “In fact, the Taliban were planning an ambush for me,” Mr. Qenaat said. He said that militants target judges because government courts often convict and sentence captured Taliban members. One of the judges killed, Mohammad Emal, 48, had sentenced a Taliban fighter from Logar Province to prison two weeks earlier, Mr. Qenaat said. Mr. Qenaat said five judges from Paktia Province had been killed between early September and early November. He said several judges had arranged transfers for fear of assassination. Some districts were considered so unsafe that no judge would serve there. “We ask local security officials, but they don’t provide good security and it seems they don’t want to escort us,” Mr. Qenaat added. Numan Dost, a brother of another slain judge, Noorullah Qubani, 49, said they had been abducted near an army checkpoint. “We can’t count on our security forces,” he said. Major Mukhlis, the Logar police chief, said soldiers had secured parts of the roadway where the judges were killed and were available as escorts. A Taliban spokesman, Zabibullah Mujahid, said he was unaware of any Taliban involvement in the judges’ deaths. But Mr. Dost noted that the victims’ families had recovered cash and cellphones from their bodies, suggesting that robbery was not a motive. For Mr. Panjshiri, the death of his brother was like many other unsolved roadway murders — bewildering, politicized and ultimately incomprehensible.  Khanzada Mazlomyar, governor of the district where the professor’s body was found, blamed the Taliban. So did Ahmad Jawid Basharat, a spokesman for the Baghlan Province police. But the Taliban denied the accusation, saying in a statement that Professor Panjshiri “was a civilian, and his killing can’t be justified. He wasn’t a target.”  At Professor Panjshiri’s funeral in Kabul, mourners suggested a more complicated narrative. They said the professor had been invited by acquaintances to visit them in his home province of Panjshir in northern Afghanistan. He was abducted en route, taken to neighboring Baghlan Province and killed the next day, they said. Abdul Saboor, 27, a relative who said he had recovered the professor’s body, said the family paid an $18,000 ransom. But the kidnappers killed the professor, then dumped his body in a Taliban-controlled area to implicate the militants, he said. The professor’s brother confirmed that his family had paid a ransom, but he declined to speculate about whether the Taliban or criminals were responsible for his abduction and killing. Professor Panjshiri was eulogized as a popular, bookish man who had worked on cultural issues after retiring in 2015, following 30 years as a geology professor at Kabul University. A Ministry of Information and Culture official delivered a floral arrangement adorned with a photo of the white-haired professor. Professor Panjshiri briefly served as a diplomat in Iran, friends said, but he was not overtly political. “He dedicated his life to the education of the Afghan people,” said Gul Haidar, a former mujahedeen commander from Panjshir and a close friend. Mr. Haidar said the professor had been an adviser to Ahmad Shah Masood, a legendary anti-Taliban commander. But he said he didn’t know whether that was a factor in the killing.  “I don’t know who was behind this, but there is a political dimension, I’m sure,” Mr. Haidar said. “We hope to find out more.” At the grave site, Mr. Panjshiri broke down in tears as he eulogized his brother. “I haven’t been able to sleep since this happened,” he said.

"Netanyahu Rebuffs a Challenge From Within, Despite Graft Charges",2019-12-26,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel easily brushed off a challenge for the leadership of the conservative Likud party early Friday, a crucial victory for Israel’s longest-serving leader but one that may only harden the country’s yearlong political standoff. For Mr. Netanyahu, the landslide in a party primary on Thursday reaffirmed his political prowess and staying power despite his indictment last month on corruption charges, and it gives a jolt of fresh energy to his campaign for Israel’s next general election in March. But it also assures that one of Israel’s most polarizing issues will be on the ballot in that election: Mr. Netanyahu himself. Israel has already had two inconclusive elections this year, each ending in deadlock with voters nearly evenly divided on whether the corruption cases against Mr. Netanyahu should disqualify him from serving a fourth consecutive term.  And though support for Mr. Netanyahu has been slipping since his indictment,  recent polls suggest that a third election may not resolve anything. Once again, neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his main opponent, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, may have the votes to form a majority government. In the party primary on Thursday, the most serious internal leadership challenge Mr. Netanyahu had faced in years, he handily beat a rival party veteran, Gideon Saar, by a vote of 72 percent to 28 percent, according to official results. “A giant victory!” Mr. Netanyahu declared on Twitter just after midnight, barely more than an hour after the polls closed. “With the help of God and with your help, I will lead Likud to a great victory in the upcoming elections and we will continue to lead the country to unprecedented achievements,” he added.  Mr. Saar congratulated Mr. Netanyahu and conceded defeat in a televised statement an hour later. He said he and his colleagues would stand behind Mr. Netanyahu in the party’s campaign for the general election.  “I am content with my decision to have run” in the primary, Mr. Saar said, adding, “Those who are unwilling to take a risk for what they believe in will never succeed.” But the fact that there even was a battle exposed cracks in Likud’s long-united front as it prepares for an eventual post-Netanyahu era.  Despite fears of a low turnout because of stormy weather and the Hanukkah holiday, about half the 116,000 paying Likud members came out to vote, a fairly typical number for Likud party primaries.  Though those eligible to vote in the Likud leadership primary were only a small fraction of those who vote for the party in general elections, Thursday’s contest may serve to allay broader concerns ahead of the March election that Israelis are suffering from voter fatigue and may give up on the democratic process. Mr. Saar, a hawkish ideologue and technocrat, had argued that only he could return Likud and its right-wing allies to power and that Mr. Netanyahu was “blocked” after failing to form a government after the two previous elections, in April and September. In those elections, neither Mr. Netanyahu nor Mr. Gantz was able to muster a majority to build a viable coalition.  Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz both professed interest in joining forces in a unity government, which polls showed most Israelis wanted, but Mr. Gantz said he would refuse to serve in a government with a prime minister who is under indictment, and Mr. Netanyahu insisted that under any agreement to rotate the prime minister’s job, he must serve first. Mr. Netanyahu had little incentive to yield on that demand. He remains prime minister until a new government is formed, and retaining the job leaves him in better position to fight his legal battle.  He could, for instance, try to negotiate a plea deal with law enforcement authorities in which the charges are dropped in return for his departure from public life. A sweeping victory in the next election could even get him enough support to grant him parliamentary immunity from prosecution. Mr. Netanyahu is accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls for lavish gifts and positive news coverage. He has denied any wrongdoing, casting himself as the victim of a witch hunt by a left-wing elite that he says dominates the news media and has pressured the law enforcement authorities to pursue criminal investigations against him. Fighting for his political survival, Mr. Netanyahu left nothing to chance in the Likud primary contest. He attended campaign rallies in up to five different towns a night and appealed to voters in Facebook Live videos, re-establishing his popularity within the Likud and firing up the party’s rank and file ahead of the more fateful contest against Mr. Gantz. Mr. Netanyahu, 70, has brought Likud to power four times and has led the party for the past 14 years, and for a total of 20 years in all. Known to all as “Bibi,” he has inspired a cultlike devotion, with supporters at his rallies chanting “Bibi, King of Israel.” At age 53, Mr. Saar is one of the next generation of Likud leaders vying to succeed Mr. Netanyahu. He, too, pulled out all the stops in his bid to lead the party, even pledging to work to secure a new job for Mr. Netanyahu as the president of Israel. That post, high profile but mostly ceremonial, is meant to be apolitical and unifying. Other would-be Netanyahu successors have preferred to wait in the wings, saying they would seek the Likud leadership only once the Netanyahu era is over. Likudniks pride themselves on their fierce loyalty to their leader and challenging Mr. Netanyahu risks being cast into the political wilderness, the fate of some other former Likud ministers who bucked his control. The party has only had four leaders since its formation and rise to power in the 1970s, and has never unseated an incumbent. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Saar’s bid for the job will position him as a front-runner in the post-Netanyahu era, or if he will pay for his perceived disloyalty in challenging Mr. Netanyahu in a time of trouble. Mr. Netanyahu’s political and legal path forward remains far from clear, even with the Likud battle over. A clear election victory in March could keep him in office and give him a chance of seeking parliamentary immunity from prosecution, but nothing is guaranteed. Israel’s Supreme Court will hold a hearing on Tuesday in response to a petition requesting a ruling on whether a candidate charged with serious crimes may be asked to form a new government.  Under current Israeli law, a prime minister under indictment can continue to serve until a final conviction. But the law does not address what to do in the case of a candidate for prime minister who has been charged. The judicial authorities have so far tried to avoid ruling on the matter, hoping it would be decided in the public and political realm, through elections. So far, though, as Thursday’s contest showed, the charismatic Mr. Netanyahu still commands a strong and emotional following. Ben Caspit, a political columnist, wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Thursday that the Likud voters’ choice between Mr. Saar and Mr. Netanyahu was one “between the head and gut; between cold logic and the warm heart.”']","The embattled Israeli prime minister staved off a Likud party leadership challenge, a victory that is likely to perpetuate Israel’s political deadlock.

"An Old Menstruation Taboo Killed Her. This Time, a Man Went to Jail.",2019-12-27,By Bhadra Sharma and Jeffrey Gettleman,"['KATHMANDU, Nepal — Every winter, in Nepal’s snow-covered hills, young women keep dying because of a deadly superstition.  The tradition here says that any woman who has her period must be banished outside, to a cowshed or makeshift bunker, no matter how cold or dangerous. This has been a ritual, believed to protect the purity of the village, for as long as anyone can remember.  But this winter, someone was finally arrested in such a death — a first in Nepal, according to law enforcement officials. The case has set off a national debate about women’s rights, tradition, law and punishment. The Nepali authorities have jailed the brother-in-law of a young woman who died in a shed this month in the remote Achham District, in the far west. Many Nepalis have been disturbed by her death, and one newspaper called the taboo — called chhaupadi (pronounced CHOW-pa-dee) — a “national shame.” Human rights activists have been pressing the authorities to enforce a law that went into effect last year that punishes family members who exile menstruating women from their own homes. Still, villagers continue to do it, and many residents in Achham are upset that someone was sent to jail.  “The police are just adding pain over pain,’’ said Krishna Budha, the chief of the village where the young woman died. “She had gone to the hut on her own, taking part of our culture.”  But Nepal’s highest authorities intervened, leading police officers to make the arrest. An investigation is underway.  In the past few weeks, villagers have been ordered to destroy dozens of chhaupadi huts, and Nepal’s home ministry has threatened to cut off government aid to families that do not comply with a law that bans the chhaupadi ritual. “The police did a good job this time,” said Pashupati Kunwar, a leading anti-chhaupadi activist. “This has sent a warning.”  In Nepali language, chhaupadi means someone who bears an impurity. Menstruating women are considered polluted, even toxic, and from the earliest age, people here are taught that any contact with a menstruating woman will bring bad luck. An oppressive tradition has evolved around this taboo, including the construction of a separate hut for menstruating women to retreat to at night and then sleep in. Some of the spaces are as tiny as a closet, walls made of mud or rock, basically menstruation foxholes. Each year, at least one woman, usually more, and often young, dies in such a tiny space from smoke inhalation, a snake bite or exposure to the cold. On Dec. 2, it happened again.  Shortly after sunrise, according to police officials, relatives of Parbati Budha, 21, sensed that something was wrong. Ms. Budha, who lived in a mountain village about a two-day drive from the capital, Kathmandu, was usually an early riser. She was known in the village as a determined worker who was quite bright; she graduated from 12th grade, unusual for girls from her village.  But on this morning, she did not emerge from her chhaupadi hut. When her sister-in-law and brother-in-law went to check on her, they found her on the shed’s floor, face down. Investigators said she had built a small fire inside the hut to keep warm during the freezing night, and died from inhaling too much smoke.  Ms. Budha had married about a year and a half ago and moved in with her husband’s family, as most women do in rural Nepal. Her husband worked in a sari showroom in neighboring India, and police officials say it was her husband’s brother, Chhatra Raut, 25, who pressured Ms. Budha to move out to the shed. (Some police officials said his name was Chhatra Rawat.) The news about Ms. Budha’s death quickly spread, dismaying human rights activists. The activists, including Ms. Kunwar, asked the local police to investigate, but the officers refused. The officers said that nobody in the village had complained about the young woman’s death and therefore there was no case.  But the activists kept up their pressure. And in Kathmandu, the tide has turned against chhaupadi, which has become something of an embarrassment to those trying to modernize Nepal.  After hearing what happened, Nepal’s attorney general, Agni Prasad Kharel, stepped in and ordered police officials to open an investigation, which quickly led them to the brother-in-law. The police arrested Mr. Raut and are holding him in a small jail. He faces a three-month sentence if found guilty of breaking the chhaupadi law, which makes it a crime to pressure a woman into seclusion.  Kedar Nath Sharma, a spokesman for the Home Ministry, said that any members of a family still practicing chhaupadi would not get the usual government allowances for elderly people and single women, concessional loans or recommendations for a school scholarship or government job.  He said the Nepali government was serious about ending this tradition once and for all.  “Women are dying in these huts,” he said. Bhadra Sharma reported from Kathmandu, and Jeffrey Gettleman from New Delhi.']","In a first for Nepal, the authorities have arrested a man who forced his sister-in-law to sleep out in a cold hut during her period."
"In Brazil, Firebombs Seek to Terrorize Makers of Film Portraying Jesus as Gay",2019-12-26,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — The masked assailants crept up to the building hours before dawn on Christmas Eve and lobbed a handful of Molotov cocktails. Their target: a Rio de Janeiro-based film company that has come under criticism for producing a Netflix movie depicting Jesus Christ as a gay man. The firebombs did little damage to the building and hurt no one. But hours later, a video posted online by three men taking credit for the attack made clear this was an effort to silence artists whose works take aim at conservatives and their worldview. The video included footage of the act and featured a masked man who said, in a distorted voice, that the group set out to “seek justice” on behalf of “all Brazilians against the blasphemous, bourgeois and anti-patriotic attitude” of the filmmakers, who were denounced as “militant Marxists.” The Brazilian actor Gregorio Duvivier, who plays Jesus in the film, “The First Temptation of Christ,” said Thursday that the attack set a disturbing precedent. “We have endured all types of verbal assaults, online, even from members of Congress,” said Mr. Duvivier, who is one of the members of the production company Porta dos Fundos, or Back Door, which is known for biting satire. “But this is the first time we’ve faced violence of this nature, an attack that could have killed people.” As President Jair Bolsonaro campaigned for his office in 2018, he warned that Brazil desperately needed sweeping cultural changes to excise an era of what he called “cultural Marxism.” The two elected presidents who preceded Mr. Bolsonaro were leftists. Since he came to power, Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies have criticized film projects and other artistic productions that were slated to receive public funding. The government earlier this year sharply cut its funding for the National Cinema Agency, a federal organization that is the main source of financing for Brazilian films. One of the projects Mr. Bolsonaro took issue with was a film about the lives of gay black men in the capital. That has led Brazilian artists and filmmakers to complain about an environment of hostility and censorship. “The political discourse has been one of violence,” Mr. Duvivier said, noting that Mr. Bolsonaro at one point threatened to “gun down” his political opponents. The group in the video called itself a Popular National Insurgence Command and used terms that harken back to a fascist movement that was active in Brazil during the 1930s. Police officials in Rio de Janeiro confirmed the video is legitimate and are studying it and the surveillance footage that captured the attack to identify suspects. At least four men were involved, police said.  “The case is being treated as a very serious one,” Marcus Vinícius Braga, Rio de Janeiro’s Civil Police Secretary, said on Thursday, adding that intelligence and cybercrime units had taken it on in addition to local police. Mr. Braga said the incident was being investigated as an explosion and attempted murder and was not currently being considered a terrorist attack. Since “The First Temptation of Christ” was released in early December, many conservatives in Brazil, which is home to more Catholics than any other country in the world and to a fast-growing conservative evangelical population, have responded with outrage.  In the film, Jesus comes home for his 30th birthday with a flamboyant male partner. It is a sequel to “The Last Hangover,” a parody released last year that portrayed the Last Supper as a drunken affair. A petition to have Netflix drop the film has gathered roughly two million signatures. Among those who have rebuked Netflix over the film was Eduardo Bolsonaro, a federal lawmaker and one of the president’s sons.  “We’re in favor of freedom of expression, but is it worth it to attack the faith of 86 percent of the population?” he wrote on Twitter. “I leave you with that reflection.”']",Brazilian filmmakers and artists said the attack on a production company on Christmas Eve sets a dangerous precedent in a country roiled by culture wars. 
3 Family Members Drown in Swimming Pool Accident in Spain,2019-12-25,By Iliana Magra,"['Three members of a family vacationing in southern Spain drowned after becoming trapped in a swimming pool, prompting an investigation into a potential malfunction with a drainage mechanism that may have sucked them underwater, the authorities said on Wednesday. The tragedy unfolded when a 9-year-old girl began having difficulties in the pool. When her father jumped in to rescue her, he then became trapped, too. Another family member, a 16-year-old, then entered the water to help, but all three died, said Jorge Martín, a spokesman for the Civil Guard of Malaga Province, where the accident happened.  The father and daughter were British citizens and the teenager was American, the authorities said. No further details were given about them, though five members of the family were said to have arrived in the town of Mijas on Saturday. Accidents linked to faulty drainage or pumping systems in pools have happened before. In 2002, a 7-year-old girl from McLean, Va., drowned in a spa when she became entrapped by the powerful drag of a portal sucking water into a filtration system, and a man and three children died at a water park in Texas in 2004. The family vacationing in Mijas had apparently been sunbathing at an outdoor swimming pool at the Club La Costa World resort on Tuesday when the accident occurred, Mr. Martín said by telephone. The police are treating the deaths as an accident, Mr. Martín said, though they are still trying to determine what happened. “The question about why the girl, the father and the third member of the family had problems to get out of the swimming pool is being investigated,” he said, adding that officers were also awaiting autopsy results. Mr. Martín said that investigators were looking into whether “there were some problems with the engine of the swimming pool” and whether there was a problem with the suction mechanism of the pool’s drain.  “All at Club La Costa World resort are devastated by the tragedy,” the company that owns the resort, CLC World Resorts and Hotels, said in a statement. Club La Costa World was “assisting the authorities fully,” it said. Late Wednesday, the company said that investigators had already concluded that there was no problem with the pool’s systems, but the authorities said they had yet to reach such a finding. A worker at the resort, responding to other vacationers’ cries for help, jumped into the pool to help the family members but was too late, Mr. Martín said.  Although the worker managed to retrieve the bodies, he also reported difficulties in getting out of the pool, describing the effect as being “like swimming in a wild river,” according to Mr. Martín.

Iraq’s New Election Law Draws Much Criticism and Few Cheers,2019-12-25,By Falih Hassan and Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — The Iraqi Parliament made good on its promise to overhaul the country’s election laws, voting on Tuesday to make sweeping changes in how lawmakers are elected, seemingly in response to demands from protesters to give citizens a greater voice.  The law does away with voting for lists of candidates grouped by party and replaces it with voting for individuals, which would seem to lessen the influence of political parties seen by protesters as corrupt.  But within hours of its passage, criticism began to roll in from legal experts, intellectuals and the Iraqi street suggesting that the law might not work as advertised.  By midnight a banner was flying in Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the protests, saying, “Let them not cheat you: The election law does not represent us.”  Legislators defended the new law, insisting that they were heeding the will of the protesters.  “The political blocs listened to the demands of the demonstrators and carried out a peaceful coup upon themselves by passing the election law,” said Wajih Abbas, a lawmaker from Sadiqoon, the party led by Qais al-Khazali, who is viewed as close to Iran.  The populist political and religious leader Muqtada al-Sadr, whose political bloc is one of Iraq’s largest, tweeted support for the law, describing it as a “first step on the path of reforms.”  Tens of thousands of his followers have been in the streets for months, pushing for many of the changes the new law purports to include. But already, doubts have emerged over how the law will be put into practice. Abbas Kadhim, the director of the Iraq Initiative and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the measure had created something “similar to a congressional system, but Iraq’s system is parliamentary.”  “It is like having a Volkswagen bug and deciding it needs a new engine and you get the best — an engine for a Ferrari — but the two don’t work together,” said Mr. Kadhim, a longtime observer of the Iraqi political system.  The new law would divide Iraq into districts, with a member of Parliament elected from each. It is not clear how many people will be in each district — and there has not been a census in more than 20 years, so no one really knows how many people live in any given area.  Perhaps the bigger issue is that once representatives get to Parliament, according to the Iraqi Constitution, they will have to form political parties in order to choose a prime minister.  What could easily happen, Mr. Kadhim said, is that the parties will send representatives to run as individuals in districts around Iraq, injecting money and other support into the campaigns as needed. The parliamentary blocs will simply regroup once the elections are over.  “Then it will go back to the status quo,” Mr. Kadhim said.  The status quo is exactly what drew demonstrators into the streets in October when they first gathered to protest a lack of jobs and services, and the failure of Parliament to respond to Iraqi citizens.  After the government opened fire on demonstrators, killing more than 100 people in the first five days of protests, the number of people taking to the streets multiplied. They also began to agitate for more far-reaching changes that would rid the system of the political parties that many see as the cause of government corruption.  Many of those parties are also close to Iran or indebted to it for support. For the protesters, reducing Iran’s influence and holding early elections have become a rallying cry. More than 500 people have been killed during the three months of protests, and about 19,000 have been wounded.  Early elections look unlikely, however, because the law is silent on how electoral districts will be formed or who will designate them. Figuring out how that will work could take months or longer, said Tariq Harb, an expert on the Iraqi Constitution and legal system. “The technical complications related to identifying new districts, thousands of them across the country, means there will not be early elections,” Mr. Harb said.   ']","Iraq’s Parliament voted to overhaul the country’s election laws in a bid to reduce the power of political parties. But many protesters, who had called for just such a change, were not impressed.

"Growing a Little Marijuana at Home Is Not a Crime, Italy’s Top Court Says",2019-12-27,By Anna Momigliano,"['ROME — Growing small amounts of marijuana at home for private use is not a crime, Italy’s top court has ruled, putting an end to a yearslong legal dispute and adding Italy to the short list of countries to allow cultivation of recreational cannabis. A 1990s law prohibits the cultivation and sale of marijuana in Italy, but conflicting court decisions, and a 2016 amendment that opened a loophole in the law, created confusion over how it should be interpreted. The country’s highest court appears to have settled at least part of the question, writing in a one-page statement of its findings that “at home, small-scale cultivation activities are to be considered excluded from the application of the penal code.” The judges produced the document on Dec. 19 and it was first publicized on Thursday by the news agency AGI. A full, detailed ruling remains weeks or months away, so the court’s complete reasoning has not been made public.  Among the unanswered questions is how much cannabis qualifies as “small-scale cultivation,” but the ruling stemmed from a case in which the defendant had two plants. The court appears to have stopped short of outright legalizing marijuana, but has decriminalized small-scale, private cultivation, meaning that while it might still be technically illegal, it is not treated as a serious crime and carries only light penalties. “It’s a very important decision, because it will shield from prison those who choose to cultivate marijuana for personal use,” said Leonardo Fiorentini, a representative of the drug policy advocacy group Forum Droghe. Only a handful of countries have, to varying degrees, legalized possession or cultivation of small amounts of cannabis for recreational use, most of them recently. Lawmakers in Uruguay voted in 2013 to remove the prohibition, and the law went into full effect in 2017. In 2018, Canada’s Parliament legalized marijuana, and the Supreme Courts of both Mexico and South Africa struck down their bans. In Spain, a law has been in place for decades that allows small-scale, private growing and use of the drug, but the number of people taking advantage of it has grown rapidly in the past decade. A few other countries have decriminalized limited possession, cultivation or both. They include the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Colombia and Chile. Still others allow marijuana for medical use, including Italy, where the army has a monopoly on commercial growing and a marijuana greenhouse in Florence. In 2013, a court in Torre Annunziata, a small town in southern Italy, sentenced a man, identified in court records only as CG, to one year in prison and a fine of 3,000 euros for growing two cannabis plants at home. He appealed the decision, first to a higher court in Naples and eventually to Italy’s Corte Suprema di Cassazione, the supreme court. Unlike its American counterpart, Italy’s supreme court is divided into multiple sections for different areas of law, and they had come to differing conclusions about small-scale cultivation of marijuana. The confusion stemmed partly from disagreement about how to apply the broader ban on cultivation to growing for private use, and how to apply a 2016 amendment that allowed people to grow and sell “light cannabis,” with low levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient.  As a result, Pietro Faraguna, a constitutional law professor at the University of Trieste, said that Italian courts — including the supreme court itself — have struggled to put the laws into practice. Given the contradictory rulings, in August the court asked for a ruling by its own highest authority, the Sezioni Unite, or joint sections — in effect, the supreme court of the supreme court. The Sezioni Unite ruled that the “rudimentary techniques” and “the small amount produced” in small-scale home growing makes it irrelevant to the illegal drug trade that the criminal law is intended to address. Now the court “has clearly said cultivating cannabis alone is not enough,” to be a crime, Mr. Faraguna said, setting a binding precedent.  But Mr. Fiorentini said the ruling illustrated the failure of Italy’s lawmakers, because they should make clear what their statutes mean, rather than asking judges to cut through the confusion. “Courts are bailing out politics, because politics is indecisive on the issue,” he said.']",The ruling adds Italy to the small number of countries where small-scale cultivation for personal use is allowed.
"In China’s Crackdown on Muslims, Children Have Not Been Spared",2019-12-28,By Amy Qin,"['HOTAN, China — The first grader was a good student and beloved by her classmates, but she was inconsolable, and it was no mystery to her teacher why. “The most heartbreaking thing is that the girl is often slumped over on the table alone and crying,” he wrote on his blog. “When I asked around, I learned that it was because she missed her mother.” The mother, he noted, had been sent to a detention camp for Muslim ethnic minorities. The girl’s father had passed away, he added. But instead of letting other relatives raise her, the authorities put her in a state-run boarding school — one of hundreds of such facilities that have opened in China’s far western Xinjiang region. As many as a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others have been sent to internment camps and prisons in Xinjiang over the past three years, an indiscriminate clampdown aimed at weakening the population’s devotion to Islam. Even as these mass detentions have provoked global outrage, though, the Chinese government is pressing ahead with a parallel effort targeting the region’s children. Nearly a half million children have been separated from their families and placed in boarding schools so far, according to a planning document published on a government website, and the ruling Communist Party has set a goal of operating one to two such schools in each of Xinjiang’s 800-plus townships by the end of next year. The party has presented the schools as a way to fight poverty, arguing that they make it easier for children to attend classes if their parents live or work in remote areas or are unable to care for them. And it is true that many rural families are eager to send their children to these schools, especially when they are older.  But the schools are also designed to assimilate and indoctrinate children at an early age, away from the influence of their families, according to the planning document, published in 2017. Students are often forced to enroll because the authorities have detained their parents and other relatives, ordered them to take jobs far from home or judged them unfit guardians. The schools are off limits to outsiders and tightly guarded, and it is difficult to interview residents in Xinjiang without putting them at risk of arrest. But a troubling picture of these institutions emerges from interviews with Uighur parents living in exile and a review of documents published online, including procurement records, government notices, state media reports and the blogs of teachers in the schools. State media and official documents describe education as a key component of President Xi Jinping’s campaign to wipe out extremist violence in Xinjiang, a ruthless and far-reaching effort that also includes the mass internment camps and sweeping surveillance measures. The idea is to use the boarding schools as incubators of a new generation of Uighurs who are secular and more loyal to both the party and the nation.  “The long-term strategy is to conquer, to captivate, to win over the young generation from the beginning,” said Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington who has studied Chinese policies that break up Uighur families.  To carry out the assimilation campaign, the authorities in Xinjiang have recruited tens of thousands of teachers from across China, often Han Chinese, the nation’s dominant ethnic group. At the same time, prominent Uighur educators have been imprisoned and teachers have been warned they will be sent to the camps if they resist.  Thrust into a regimented environment and immersed in an unfamiliar culture, children in the boarding schools are only allowed visits with family once every week or two — a restriction intended to “break the impact of the religious atmosphere on children at home,” in the words of the 2017 policy document. The campaign echoes past policies in Canada, the United States and Australia that took indigenous children from their families and placed them in residential schools to forcibly assimilate them. “The big difference in China is the scale and how systematic it is,” said Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado who studies Uighur culture and society. Public discussion in China of the trauma inflicted on Uighur children by separating them from their families is rare. References on social media are usually quickly censored. Instead, the state-controlled news media focuses on the party’s goals in the region, where predominantly Muslim minorities make up more than half the population of 25 million. Visiting a kindergarten near the frontier city of Kashgar this month, Chen Quanguo, the party’s top official in Xinjiang, urged teachers to ensure children learn to “love the party, love the motherland and love the people.” Abdurahman Tohti left Xinjiang and immigrated to Turkey in 2013, leaving behind cotton farming to sell used cars in Istanbul. But when his wife and two young children returned to China for a visit a few years ago, they disappeared. He heard that his wife was sent to prison, like many Uighurs who have traveled abroad and returned to China. His parents were detained too. The fate of his children, though, was a mystery. Then in January, he spotted his 4-year-old son in a video on Chinese social media that had apparently been recorded by a teacher. The boy seemed to be at a state-run boarding school and was speaking Chinese, a language his family did not use.  Mr. Tohti, 30, said he was excited to see the child, and relieved he was safe — but also gripped by desperation.  “What I fear the most,” he said, “is that the Chinese government is teaching him to hate his parents and Uighur culture.” Beijing has sought for decades to suppress Uighur resistance to Chinese rule in Xinjiang, in part by using schools in the region to indoctrinate Uighur children. Until recently, though, the government had allowed most classes to be taught in the Uighur language, partly because of a shortage of Chinese-speaking teachers. Then, after a surge of antigovernment and anti-Chinese violence, including ethnic riots in 2009 in Urumqi, the regional capital, and deadly attacks by Uighur militants in 2014, Mr. Xi ordered the party to take a harder line in Xinjiang, according to internal documents leaked to The New York Times earlier this year. In December 2016, the party announced that the work of the region’s education bureau was entering a new phase. Schools were to become an extension of the security drive in Xinjiang, with a new emphasis on the Chinese language, patriotism and loyalty to the party.  In the 2017 policy document, posted on the education ministry’s website, officials from Xinjiang outlined their new priorities and ranked expansion of the boarding schools at the top. Without specifying Islam by name, the document characterized religion as a pernicious influence on children, and said having students live at school would “reduce the shock of going back and forth between learning science in the classroom and listening to scripture at home.” By early 2017, the document said, nearly 40 percent of all middle-school and elementary-school age children in Xinjiang — or about 497,800 students — were boarding in schools. At the time, the government was ramping up efforts to open boarding schools and add dorms to schools, and more recent reports suggest the push is continuing. Chinese is also replacing Uighur as the main language of instruction in Xinjiang. Most elementary and middle school students are now taught in Chinese, up from just 38 percent three years ago. And thousands of new rural preschools have been built to expose minority children to Chinese at an earlier age, state media reported. The government argues that teaching Chinese is critical to improving the economic prospects of minority children, and many Uighurs agree. But Uighur activists say the overall campaign amounts to an effort to erase what remains of their culture. Several Uighurs living abroad said the government had put their children in boarding schools without their consent. Mahmutjan Niyaz, 33, a Uighur businessman who moved to Istanbul in 2016, said his 5-year-old daughter was sent to one after his brother and sister-in-law, the girl’s guardians, were confined in an internment camp.  Other relatives could have cared for her but the authorities refused to let them. Now, Mr. Niyaz said, the school has changed the girl. “Before, my daughter was playful and outgoing,” he said. “But after she went to the school, she looked very sad in the photos.” In a dusty village near the ancient Silk Road city of Hotan in southern Xinjiang, nestled among fields of barren walnut trees and simple concrete homes, the elementary school stood out.  It was surrounded by a tall brick wall with two layers of barbed wire on top. Cameras were mounted on every corner. And at the entrance, a guard wearing a black helmet and a protective vest stood beside a metal detector. It wasn’t always like this. Last year, officials converted the school in Kasipi village into a full-time boarding school. Kang Jide, a Chinese language teacher at the school, described the frenzied process on his public blog on the Chinese social media platform WeChat: In just a few days, all the day students were transferred. Classrooms were rearranged. Bunk beds were set up. Then, 270 new children arrived, leaving the school with 430 boarders, each in the sixth grade or below. Officials called them “kindness students,” referring to the party’s generosity in making special arrangements for their education. The government says children in Xinjiang’s boarding schools are taught better hygiene and etiquette as well as Chinese and science skills that will help them succeed in modern China.  “My heart suddenly melted after seeing the splendid heartfelt smiles on the faces of these left-behind children,” said a retired official visiting a boarding elementary school in Lop County near Hotan, according to a state media report. He added that the party had given them “an environment to be carefree, study happily, and grow healthy and strong.” But Mr. Kang wrote that being separated from their families took a toll on the children. Some never received visits from relatives, or remained on campus during the holidays, even after most teachers left. And his pupils often begged to use his phone to call their parents.  “Sometimes, when they hear the voice on the other end of the call, the children will start crying and they hide in the corner because they don’t want me to see,” he wrote.  “It’s not just the children,” he added. “The parents on the other end also miss their children of course, so much so that it breaks their hearts and they’re trembling.” The internment camps, which the government describes as job training centers, have cast a shadow even on students who are not boarders. Before the conversion of the school, Mr. Kang posted a photo of a letter that an 8-year-old girl had written to her father, who had been sent to a camp. “Daddy, where are you?” the girl wrote in an uneven scrawl. “Daddy, why don’t you come back?”  “I’m sorry, Daddy,” she continued. “You must study hard too.” Nevertheless, Mr. Kang was generally supportive of the schools. On his blog, he described teaching Uighur students as an opportunity to “water the flowers of the motherland.”  “Kindness students” receive more attention and resources than day students. Boarding schools are required to offer psychological counseling, for example, and in Kasipi, the children were given a set of supplies that included textbooks, clothes and a red Young Pioneer scarf.  Learning Chinese was the priority, Mr. Kang wrote, though students were also immersed in traditional Chinese culture, including classical poetry, and taught songs praising the party. On a recent visit to the school, children in red and blue uniforms could be seen playing in a yard beside buildings marked “cafeteria” and “student dormitory.” At the entrance, school officials refused to answer questions. Tighter security has become the norm at schools in Xinjiang. In Hotan alone, more than a million dollars has been allocated in the past three years to buy surveillance and security equipment for schools, including helmets, shields and spiked batons, according to procurement records. At the entrance to one elementary school, a facial recognition system had been installed.  Mr. Kang recently wrote on his blog that he had moved on to a new job teaching in northern Xinjiang. Reached by telephone there, he declined to be interviewed. But before hanging up, he said his students in Kasipi had made rapid progress in learning Chinese.  “Every day I feel very fulfilled,” he said.  To carry out its campaign, the party needed not only new schools but also an army of teachers, an overhaul of the curriculum — and political discipline. Teachers suspected of dissent were punished, and textbooks were rewritten to weed out material deemed subversive. “Teachers are the engineers of the human soul,” the education bureau of Urumqi recently wrote in an open letter, deploying a phrase first used by Stalin to describe writers and other cultural workers. The party launched an intensive effort to recruit teachers for Xinjiang from across China. Last year, nearly 90,000 were brought in, chosen partly for their political reliability, officials said at a news conference this year. The influx amounted to about a fifth of Xinjiang’s teachers last year, according to government data. The new recruits, often ethnic Han, and the teachers they joined, mostly Uighurs, were both warned to toe the line. Those who opposed the Chinese-language policy or resisted the new curriculum were labeled “two-faced” and punished.  The deputy secretary-general of the oasis town of Turpan, writing earlier this year, described such teachers as “scum of the Chinese people” and accused them of being “bewitched by extremist religious ideology.” Teachers were urged to express their loyalty, and the public was urged to keep an eye on them. A sign outside a kindergarten in Hotan invited parents to report teachers who made “irresponsible remarks” or participated in unauthorized religious worship. Officials in Xinjiang also spent two years inspecting and revising hundreds of textbooks and other teaching material, according to the 2017 policy document.  Some who helped the party write and edit the old textbooks ended up in prison, including Yalqun Rozi, a prominent scholar and literary critic who helped compile a set of textbooks on Uighur literature that were used for more than a decade. Mr. Rozi was charged with attempted subversion and sentenced to 15 years in prison last year, according to his son, Kamaltürk Yalqun. Several other members of the committee that compiled the textbooks were arrested too, he said. “Instead of welcoming the cultural diversity of Uighurs, China labeled it a malignant tumor,” said Mr. Yalqun, who lives in Philadelphia. There is evidence that some Uighur children have been sent to boarding schools far from their homes. Kalbinur Tursun, 36, entrusted five of her children to relatives when she left Xinjiang to give birth in Istanbul but has been unable to contact them for several years.  Last year, she saw her daughter Ayshe, then 6, in a video circulating on Chinese social media. It had been posted by a user who appeared to be a teacher at a school in Hotan — more than 300 miles away from their home in Kashgar. “My children are so young, they just need their mother and father,” Ms. Tursun said, expressing concern about how the authorities were raising them. “I fear they will think that I’m the enemy — that they won’t accept me and will hate me.” Fatima Er contributed reporting from Istanbul.']","Nearly half a million children, many of them ethnic minorities, have been placed in boarding schools in Xinjiang where the authorities aim to instill loyalty to China and the Communist Party.

"Somalia Bombing Kills Nearly 80, Raising Fears of Resurgent Militancy",2019-12-28,"By Hussein Mohamed, Abdi Latif Dahir and Eric Schmitt","['MOGADISHU, Somalia — An explosives-laden truck blew up at a busy intersection in the Somali capital on Saturday and killed at least 79 people, the latest sign of resurgent militant activity in a country plagued by an enduring strain of violent extremism. A bus carrying university students to their campus was struck by the blast, which left the streets littered with bodies and the mangled frames of vehicles. The attack, which the government said also injured 149 people, was the worst in Somalia in more than two years. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion immediately fell on the Shabab, a terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda which controls large parts of the country and raises considerable funds through local taxation and extortion. Despite intensified American airstrikes and a long-running African Union offensive, the group has carried out deadly attacks not only in Somalia but also in neighboring Kenya and Uganda. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear that much progress has been made against combating what has become a very resilient and deadly insurgency,” said Murithi Mutiga, the Horn of Africa project director at the International Crisis Group, a research organization. The attack — one of several this year in Mogadishu including a gun battle two weeks ago that killed five people at a well-known hotel — added to concerns about the abilities of Somali forces as African Union troops begin to withdraw from the Horn of Africa nation.  The African Union peacekeeping operation has been active in Somalia since 2007, but Somali forces are set to assume responsibility for security in May. Six thousand to 7,000 American troops are stationed in Africa, with the largest numbers concentrated in the sub-Saharan region and in the Horn of Africa.  In Somalia, about 600 Special Operations forces are fighting the Shabab from small outposts alongside local troops. The Pentagon is weighing whether to sharply reduce or pull out several hundred American troops stationed in West Africa as the first phase of a global reshuffling of United States forces. But Defense Department officials said it was less likely that troops would be withdrawn from Somalia because — as Saturday’s attack gruesomely underscores — security in the country remains fraught. The Pentagon so far this year has carried out 60 drone strikes in Somalia — almost all against Shabab militants, with a handful against a branch of the Islamic State. That compares with 47 strikes against the Shabab in 2018. The American Embassy in Mogadishu said in a tweet that the United States “continues to stand with Somalis in defeating and degrading terrorism.”  The United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, through his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said “the perpetrators of this horrendous crime must be brought to justice.”  While violent extremist groups like the Islamic State also operate in Somalia, none except the Shabab have proved capable of repeated, large-scale attacks in the capital. The Shabab has also declared war on pro-Islamic State cells in Somalia, most of which operate at a distance from Mogadishu in the northeastern Puntland region. The Shabab, which means The Youth in Arabic, have wreaked havoc in Somalia since 2006, when they began pursuing their goal of establishing an Islamic state. In areas that it controls, the group has banned music, movies, the shaving of beards and the internet.  In recent years, the Shabab have suffered several critical setbacks, including territorial losses, the killing of senior commanders and high-level defections. Yet the group has proved resilient, intensifying its lethal campaign against the Somali government and its allies. Given its control over large areas of the country’s south, it continues to raise considerable revenue and is now manufacturing explosives, according to the United Nations. Beset by strife and chaos since the dictator Siad Barre was ousted in 1991, Somalia has become a byword for chronic state collapse, torn between a stew of rapacious, heavily armed militias and, for a time, linked to piracy on the high seas. Several international attempts to stabilize the country ended in abject failure, and its people have suffered seemingly endless miseries. In 1993, Somalia’s problems drew the world’s attention after 18 American soldiers were killed in an operation aimed at capturing the powerful Somali warlord Gen. Mohamed Farah Aideed — events depicted in the film “Black Hawk Down.” The United States was leading a United Nations mission to end famine and civil war in the country. For years, Somalia was run by warlords and weak transitional administrations, and did not take the first steps toward recovery until 2012, when a United Nations-backed federal government emerged in Mogadishu. With a population of about 12.3 million, Somalia continues to rank among the poorest nations in the world. While no longer considered a failed state, it remains in a fragile phase of recovery with a debt-laden economy and soaring unemployment. Over the last two years, Somalia has also emerged as a central battleground between Persian Gulf monarchies competing for power and profits in the Horn of Africa. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar have each provided weapons or military training to favored factions. The country is expected to hold elections next year, but a political stalemate between the central government and federal states has dampened the prospect of change.  Independent terrorism specialists said the attacks represented a dangerous escalation of violence. “It clearly demonstrates that Shabab has the capability and the will to kill civilians, terrorize the population, and destabilize the modicum of governance in the country that does exist,” said Colin P. Clarke, a senior fellow at the Soufan Center, a research organization in New York. The government, Mr. Clarke said, “continues to flounder, unable to bring security to the war-torn capital.” Tricia Bacon, an assistant professor at American University, said in an email that the Shabab “remains resilient, strong, able to terrorize Mogadishu at will, and, by extension, undermine the legitimacy of the Somali government.” In January, the Shabab claimed responsibility for an attack on a luxury hotel and office complex in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, that killed more than 20 people. In July, militants killed 26 people in a hotel in the southern port city of Kismayo, including a prominent Canadian-Somali journalist, Hodan Nalayeh.  The same month, a suicide attack by the group fatally wounded the mayor of Mogadishu, Abdirahman Omar Osman, a British-Somali citizen. And on a single day in September, the Shabab targeted an American base in Somalia and a group of Italian peacekeeping troops. Mr. Mutiga of the International Crisis Group said the attacks showed the group’s reach. “This is a year in which they demonstrated a capacity to attack in the capital at a rate that signifies they remain a very potent player,” he said.  The Shabab are suspected in one of the deadliest terrorist strikes in recent years, a double-truck bombing in the heart of Mogadishu that killed nearly 600 people in October 2017.  Saturday’s blast occurred just before 8 a.m. at Ex-control Junction, an intersection that connects Mogadishu to southern and southwestern Somalia.  Mogadishu’s mayor, Omar Mohamud Mohamed, said at a news conference that many of the wounded were students. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed ordered the government to put all of its resources toward supporting the wounded and families of the dead.  “The terrorists massacred the people because of the enmity they have for the country’s development,” he said. The foreign minister of Turkey, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said two Turkish citizens were among those killed, and Somali officials later said they were engineers.  Turkey has deepened its presence in Somalia over the past several years, opening a military base there in 2017, its largest overseas. Turkish companies have also invested in health care, education and infrastructure across Somalia.   Somalia’s prime minister, Hassan Khayre, said in a statement that he had appointed a national committee that would help respond to the victims and evacuate those who might need medical care abroad. “Everything went up in the air,” Shafi’i Dahir, a student at Mogadishu University who was near the scene of explosion, said. “So many people were affected. This is a tragedy.” Fatuma Mohamud Ali, a student at Benadir University, said she sustained wounds to her hands while some of her fellow students suffered minor injuries. “There was a lot of deaths today,” she said, “but thankfully I am fine.” After the attack on Saturday, some Somalis lamented the state of the nation’s politics and asked when lawmakers and leaders would deal with the security situation.  “When will our politicians have human feeling to the relentless massacre against the innocent citizen?” Ahmed Ibrahim, a Mogadishu resident, wrote in a post on Twitter. “Here they are arguing and competing for power, but who will they rule?” Hussein Mohamed reported from Mogadishu, Abdi Latif Dahir from Nairobi, Kenya, and Eric Schmitt from New York. Declan Walsh contributed reporting from Ballina, Ireland.']","A truck filled with explosives blew up at a busy intersection in the capital.

"Voracious Appetite for Sea Cucumbers Fuels a Farm Boom, but at a Cost",2019-12-29,By Steven Lee Myers and Gilles Sabrié,"['GUANGLU ISLAND, China — Sea cucumbers are like chickens, Cong Xuanzhi explained. He did not mean the taste. He was describing how sea cucumbers, the unlovely cousins of starfish and sea urchins, end up on the tables of the Chinese today. “Some are raised in pens,” Mr. Cong said, wearing blue overalls and white rubber boots, and standing outside a long cinder-block building that contained 54 pools filled with sea cucumbers, redolent of the sea. “And some are free range.” That’s a figure of speech, strictly speaking, since the creatures barely move in their lives. Mr. Cong’s comment, though, highlights yet another consequence of China’s enormous economic transformation, which has lifted millions of people out of poverty and also stoked a voracious appetite for delicacies like the sea cucumber. In China, sea cucumbers have been highly prized for centuries for their nutritional value and texture, if not their flavor. They are believed to have medicinal properties, treating ailments from arthritis to impotency. In their wild state, though, they have become a rarity, even on Guanglu Island, off the Liaodong Peninsula, which is famous for them. In a few decades, demand has all but depleted the natural stocks of the local species. So the authorities have turned to aquaculture — with some of the animals raised in sedentary conditions in pens or ponds near the shoreline, while others are raised in the sea in something approximating their natural habitat. Those are considered free range. The entire effort is fueling a boom in the local economy that has reshaped the Liaodong coast.  Huge stretches of tidal flatlands northeast of Dalian, the peninsula’s port city, have been carved into patchworks of ponds so vast they are visible in satellite maps.  The ponds, fed by ocean water, are seeded with young sea cucumbers that, within a year, grow large enough to harvest. Farther inland, huge structures like Mr. Cong’s breed sea cucumbers that are destined for tidal ponds nearby or, in his case, as far away as Fujian, the southeastern province.  Some companies breed larvae and seed sections of the open sea with them that the government licenses to harvesting operations. “People here all rely on this,” said Liu Aiqing, who was recording the weight of the animals that divers pulled out of a nearby pond, larger than a football field. She used to work in a factory.  Sea cucumbers have become the most valuable farmed sea product in China, worth more than $8 billion a year, said Bao Pengyun, a marine biologist whose research at Dalian Ocean University contributed to the development of the industry in China. They are also good for the environment, feeding off the rocks and sand where they live, purifying the surrounding water. Their eradication would be devastating up and down the food chain. Homages to the sea cucumber abound in and around Dalian. Restaurants and markets have sea cucumber statues. There is a sea cucumber-themed resort, with hotels, a museum and a cartoon mascot. One of the most famous seafood restaurants in Dalian, Wanbao Seafood Fang, plays a video of sea cucumbers in an endless loop, including a subtitled clip from Fox News discussing how they might even be a “miracle cure” for cancer.  The Michelin online guide to Chinese cuisine offers this helpful guidance: “A book in the Ming dynasty notes its physical resemblance to men’s genitals, which might contribute to its popularity as an ingredient at that time, given the Chinese belief that one can reinforce a specific part of the body by eating food that are in a similar shape.”  The local variety, the Japanese spiky sea cucumber, is among the seven species of the animal listed as endangered — nine more are considered vulnerable — by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. By some estimates 70 percent of the world’s edible species of sea cucumbers are over exploited — from the South Pacific to the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Mexico. Like Mr. Cong and others in the industry, Mr. Bao, the marine biologist, thinks there is little difference between sea cucumbers raised in pens or free range, and those from the wild. “Very much the same,” he said. Not everyone agrees. “The difference is tangible,” said Mou Jie, who with friends drove two hours up the coast from Dalian to catch a ferry that deposited her nearly an hour later on Guanglu. She could have bought wild sea cucumbers in Dalian but instead waited in a blustery November chill for a flat-bottomed boat to pull ashore and unload its catch.  Wild sea cucumbers have wider and whiter spikes. Those from colder waters grow more slowly, typically three years instead of one, making them more nutritious. Here’s another difference: Wild ones, whether fresh, partially processed or dried, cost two to three times as much. The most expensive — dried — can cost almost $1,000 a kilogram.  “If you don’t lack money, you’ll buy this one,” said Yang Yufeng, a vendor at the main wholesale fish market in Dalian, pointing to the most expensive wild sea cucumbers he had.  The sluggish sea cucumbers might be easy to catch, but it is not easy work.  During the peak harvest season, as fall turns into winter, divers plunge into water that is about 48 degrees Fahrenheit, coming up for only short breaks to unload their mesh nets. They are paid according to the weight, and can earn the equivalent of several hundred dollars a day. Under Chinese law, those harvested by divers here cannot be sold as wild because they come from seeded stock, meaning those partially raised with human help have intermingled with the wild ones. “We just say that they are sea cucumbers from the deep sea,” said Hao Junze, the chief executive officer of Dalian Caishen Island Group, the company that operates the concessions on the sea floor around Guanglu. Mr. He said his company has not seeded the area since 2013, effectively restoring it to something like the wild it once was. Our stock, he said, “is naturally breeding on its own.”  Ms. Mou and her friends bought about 800 fresh sea cucumbers, enough to last the whole winter, and watched in the cold as three workers gutted the animals with box cutters and piled them in a heaping, muddy mess. So about the taste: Haters, and there are many, say sea cucumbers are flavorless and have the texture of cartilage or, worse, rubber.  When plucked alive from the sea, blanched lightly and bathed in, say, a sauce of garlic, cilantro and chili oil — as they are served at a small fish restaurant not far away — they taste like a rubbery piece of cartilage, bathed in a sauce of garlic, cilantro and chili oil.  In short, not bad at all. Steven Lee Myers is a veteran diplomatic and national security correspondent, now based in the Beijing bureau.

U.K. Arrests Man Who Sent £150 to Son Fighting With Kurds in Syria,2019-12-27,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The father of a British citizen who fought with Kurdish forces in northern Syria has been arrested on suspicion of financing terrorism, in a rare action taken against a relative of a European citizen who joined the Kurdish ranks. The father, Paul Newey, said on Friday that he had given £150, or about $196, to his son, Daniel, who traveled to Syria in October to fight with the People’s Protection Units, also known as the Y.P.G. The Kurdish force fought with the American military against the Islamic State, or ISIS, in Syria. Daniel Newey first went to Syria in August 2017. He returned home in March 2018, before going back to Syria this fall after Turkey launched an offensive in Kurdish-controlled territories. Paul Newey, 49, said he had not known his son had returned to Syria when he sent him the money. “I transfer money to him all the time, and I wanted to get him back on the road after all he’s been through since he’s been back,” Mr. Newey said in a telephone interview. Paul Newey was taken to a police station in Willenhall, England, on Dec. 11, after being arrested at his home in Solihull. The Guardian reported on Friday about the arrest of Mr. Newey, who was questioned for 36 hours and then released on bail. Mr. Newey was not charged, the police said. While prosecutors in France, Britain, Belgium and other European nations have charged relatives who sent money to Islamic State militants with terrorism offenses, no family members of volunteers who joined the Y.P.G. have faced similar charges. “The Terrorism Act in the U.K. has been used very broadly to prosecute financing of terrorism, and it’s been applied very harshly to parents of Islamic States fighters,” said Raj Chada, a criminal defense lawyer.  “Once you’ve gone down the route of prosecuting Kurdish fighters, it was inevitable that the families would also be arrested, or worse, prosecuted,” Mr. Chada added. The West Midlands police confirmed in an email that a 49-year-old man, whom they did not identify, had been arrested on Dec. 11 in Solihull on suspicion of terrorism offenses. The police said he had been released on bail pending further investigation. He has not been charged with a terrorism offense, the police said.  In recent months, the British authorities have taken a harder stance against people who have fought alongside Kurdish-led forces in Syria, a shift exemplified by a plan by Sajid Javid, recently the Home Office secretary, to designate northern Syria as a forbidden area. In May, Mr. Javid urged British citizens in the region to leave within 28 days, or face a 10-year prison sentence if they returned to Britain. The plan outraged many lawyers, academicians and British volunteers in Kurdish-controlled territories who, in a letter published in The Guardian, criticized Mr. Javid for dismissing the critical role played by Kurdish forces in the fight against ISIS.  “Using a law supposedly created to defend against ISIS, Javid is criminalizing as ‘terrorists’ those who have given more than any other British citizens in this struggle,” the signatories, which included the linguist Noam Chomsky and Mr. Chada, wrote in May.  At least eight British citizens died while fighting with the Kurdish forces in Syria. More than 11,000 Kurdish fighters died in combat against ISIS, according to Kurdish officials. In Britain, financing terrorism carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail under the Terrorism Act of 2000. In June, the parents of a British citizen who joined ISIS were found guilty of financing terrorism after they sent £223, or $292, to their son in 2015. They were sentenced to 15 months of prison, which was suspended to 12 months. The Y.P.G. is not considered a terrorist group by Britain or the United States; the government of Turkey has designated it as one. “Yet police officers kept telling me that my son was a terrorist,” Mr. Newey said about his interrogation earlier this month. A former British soldier, Daniel Burke, was charged this month with preparing an act of terrorism and financing terrorism after he spent months fighting with Y.P.G. forces in 2017 and 2018. Mr. Burke, 32, has also been accused of helping Mr. Newey travel to Iraq, according to British news reports. In a landmark case last month in Britain, Aidan James, 29, was sentenced to a year in prison for training with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., a Turkish group that has close ties with the Y.P.G. and is considered a terrorist organization by Britain, the United States and Turkey. But Mr. James was acquitted of terrorist charges for joining and fighting alongside the Y.P.G. In his sentencing remarks, the judge said that at the time Mr. James joined the Y.P.G., the group had no other goal than fighting against ISIS, and that such an action “was not terrorism at all.” Daniel Newey’s circumstance is somewhat different: His parents said he traveled back to Syria in October to fight against Turkish forces, months after ISIS had been dislodged from the last territory it held.  He has said that his father’s arrest and the potential charges against him would not deter him. He wrote in a Facebook post that Turkey’s actions were  like “crimes committed by the Nazis and various other regimes throughout recent history.” “Daniel doesn’t agree with the ethnic cleansing of Kurdish people and can’t comprehend why Western countries are sitting by and allowing atrocities to happen,” his mother, Vikki Downes, said.  Scores of people have been killed during the Turkish offensive into Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria, which began after President Trump ordered American forces to move away from the border between Syria and Turkey.  Human rights groups and Kurdish officials have criticized Western nations for abandoning the Kurdish forces. In a memo blaming the Trump administration for not trying harder to prevent the Turkish offensive, the senior American diplomat in northern Syria, William V. Roebuck, said the chaotic situation resulting from the incursion was “a catastrophic sideshow,” and that it was “to a significant degree of our making.” In Britain, Mr. Newey’s parents blamed their own government. His mother, Ms. Downes, said that because her son was allowed to keep his passport after returning from Syria last year, he was able to return there in October.  “I’m immensely proud of him, but very angry that my government has allowed him to travel,” Ms. Downes said. “If he doesn’t die, he will never be able to come to his home country.”']","The police arrested Paul Newey on suspicion of financing terrorism after his son, Daniel, traveled to Syria to fight with Kurdish-led forces."
The U.N. Tried to Save Hospitals in Syria. It Didn’t Work.,2019-12-29,By Evan Hill and Whitney Hurst,"['A United Nations system to prevent attacks on hospitals and other humanitarian sites in insurgent-held areas of Syria has been ignored by Russian and Syrian forces and marred by internal errors, a New York Times investigation has found. The repeated bombing and shelling of these sites has led relief group leaders to openly criticize the United Nations over the system, which is meant to provide warring parties with the precise locations of humanitarian sites that under international law are exempt from attack. Some of these groups have described the system of identifying and sharing sites, known as the “humanitarian deconfliction mechanism,” as effectively useless. A new offensive by Syrian and Russian forces that began in late December has devastated what remains of several towns in northwestern Syria and caused tens of thousands of civilians to flee. United Nations officials only recently created a unit to verify locations provided by relief groups that managed the exempt sites, some of which had been submitted incorrectly, The Times found. Such instances of misinformation give credibility to Russian criticisms that the system cannot be trusted and is vulnerable to misuse. “The level and scale of attacks has not really decreased,” said Dr. Mufaddal Hamadeh, the president of the Syrian American Medical Society, which supports more than 40 hospitals and other sites in insurgent-held areas of northwestern Syria. “We can say categorically that in terms of accountability, in terms of deterrence, that doesn’t work.” The Times compiled a list of 182 no-strike sites by using data provided by five relief groups and compiling public statements from others. Of those facilities, 27 were damaged by Russian or Syrian attacks since April. All were hospitals or clinics. Such a list is likely to represent only a small portion of the exempt sites struck during the Syrian war, now almost nine years old. Under international law, intentionally or recklessly bombing hospitals is a war crime. The deconfliction system works by sharing the location of humanitarian sites with Russian, Turkish and United States-led coalition forces operating in Syria, on the understanding that they will not target those sites. The system is voluntary, but relief groups said they felt intense pressure from donors and United Nations officials to participate. The groups give locations of their own choosing to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the agency that runs the system. A document prepared by the agency warned that participation in the system “does not guarantee” the safety of the sites or their personnel. The document also stated that the United Nations would not verify information provided by participating groups. The system also does not require the Russians, Turks or Americans to acknowledge receipt of no-strike locations. Whether such an arrangement can ever be successful in the brutal Syria conflict, where laws of war are disregarded on a daily basis, is an open question. The forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, alongside their Russian allies, have acted as if the deconfliction system does not exist. Local journalists and relief groups have recorded at least 69 attacks on no-strike sites since the Russian military intervention to help Mr. Assad began in October 2015, all but a few of them most likely committed by Russian or Syrian forces. Jan Egeland, a Norwegian diplomat who was an adviser to the United Nations on Syria from 2015 to 2018, said the United Nations had failed to impose sufficient repercussions on those responsible. “In general, deconfliction can work if there is a very loud, very noisy, very reliable investigation follow-up, accountability-oriented mechanism around it,” Mr. Egeland said, “so that the men who sit with their finger on the trigger understand there will be consequences if they don’t check the list or if they even deliberately target deconflicted places.” But Russia has repeatedly blocked action in the United Nations Security Council meant to strengthen accountability and humanitarian access in the Syria war, casting 14 vetoes since the conflict began, including for a resolution that would have referred Syria to the International Criminal Court. Russia’s latest veto, on Dec. 20, could halt deliveries of humanitarian aid into Syria from Turkey and Iraq starting next month. In August, the United Nations Secretary General António Guterres established a board of inquiry to investigate strikes on deconflicted sites, as well as other locations supported by the United Nations. But the investigators are currently planning to examine only seven of the dozens of attacks since April, and may not identify the perpetrators or even make their report public, a limited scope that has further angered humanitarian groups. Growing frustration over the failure of the deconfliction system led to a June meeting between an association of relief groups and Trond Jensen, a top United Nations humanitarian official in Turkey who has since moved to a new position in Gaza. A summary of the meeting that was sent to participants afterward by Mr. Jensen and that was obtained by The Times acknowledged “a huge trust deficit in the process and with those who manage it.” Relief groups felt they were putting the lives of their colleagues and other civilians at risk by participating, Mr. Jensen’s summary said. Fadi al-Dairi, chairman of the association that met with Mr. Jensen, said that the United Nations and humanitarian groups had acted in “good faith” when they began using the system but that “we’ve not achieved anything.” “There is a sense of frustration, lack of trust in everyone,” said Mr. al-Dairi, who is a co-founder of Hand in Hand for Aid and Development, which supports 53 deconflicted sites in Syria. Though the deconfliction system has existed for years, Mr. al-Dairi and others involved in relief efforts said that the United Nations humanitarian agency had only recently hired dedicated deconfliction staff in southern Turkey and Amman, Jordan, to verify locations of deconflicted sites so that false information was not sent to the warring parties. Previously, United Nations officials had told the groups that they did not have the capacity to hire more people, Mr. al-Dairi said. “Some NGOs might lack the skills when it comes to reporting the coordinates,” Mr. al-Dairi said of the groups, “but it’s up to the U.N. to confirm it.”  “It is a matter of life and death,” he added, “so that’s why they should have been more proactive, like they are now.” United Nations humanitarian officials privately told The Times that some relief groups had previously submitted incorrect locations and that, although rare, in a few cases misinformation had been shared with Russia, Turkey and the American-led coalition. The United Nations humanitarian agency has taken steps to improve the system in recent months, including the creation of a “centralized entity” to run it, according to Zoe Paxton, a spokeswoman for the agency. It also is now giving participant organizations a second opportunity to confirm submitted locations. United Nations officials emphasize that under international law, the warring parties are responsible for verifying targets and minimizing harm. Mr. Assad’s government, which has effectively criminalized the providing of health care in opposition-held areas, has repeatedly bombed humanitarian sites. Russian officials claim their Air Force carries out only precision strikes on “accurately researched targets,” and they have attacked the integrity of the deconfliction system. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, said at a news conference in September that Russian military reconnaissance had discovered “lots of instances of deliberate disinformation” in the system.  One site listed as a hospital was actually being used to store firearms, Mr. Nebenzia claimed, while other sites had been submitted with coordinates sometimes up to 10 kilometers from their real locations. “To get you a sense of an ‘iceberg’ size here, I will just say that only in July alone we were provided with 12 false coordinates,” he said. “And that is only about what we had capacity and time to check.” While some of Mr. Nebenzia’s claims were shown to be false, at least three relief groups did submit incorrect coordinates to the United Nations on various occasions, The Times found. While investigating an airstrike in November, The Times discovered that a relief group had provided coordinates for its health center that were around 240 meters away. When another hospital was bombed in May, The Times found that the coordinates submitted by its supporting organization pointed to an unrelated structure around 765 meters north. After questions from The Times prompted the organization to review its deconfliction list, a staff member discovered that it had provided the United Nations with incorrect locations for 14 of its 19 deconflicted sites. The original locations had been logged by a pharmacist. The list had been with the United Nations humanitarian agency for eight months, and no one had contacted the organization to correct the locations, a member of the organization’s staff said. Mr. al-Dairi and others involved in relief work said they assumed Russian and Syrian forces could find and target hospitals and other humanitarian sites without using the information shared by the United Nations. But they said they felt pressured to join the deconfliction system and had to convince skeptical Syrian doctors and aid workers to let them share their locations, knowing the information would go to the Russians and almost assuredly their Syrian government allies. Dr. Munzer al-Khalil, the head of the Idlib Health Directorate, which oversees health care in Syria’s last opposition-held province, said many international donors would not support medical facilities unless they joined the U.N.’s deconfliction system. “Therefore, we did not have much of an option,” Dr. al-Khalil said. “We paid a price by sharing the coordinates of the medical facilities with the United Nations. And what we got lately, frankly, was more bombing of medical facilities, and more precise bombing, and more destructive than before.” Relief group leaders said that their only remaining hope was that adding their sites to the deconfliction list had left Russia and the Syrian government with no deniability — important for theoretical war crimes trials decades in the future. “We truly believe the world has abandoned us,” Dr. al-Khalil said.

The Atheist Preacher. The Thorn in Beijing’s Side. The Mayor Awaiting Her Murder.,2019-12-27,By The New York Times,"['The opposite of a celebrity profile, which offers a surface-skimming sketch of someone everyone knows, The Saturday Profile instead delivers an in-depth look at an unfamiliar but fascinating person doing influential work around the world. Since 2002, the profile has discovered artists, activists, entrepreneurs and others whose pursuits may not yet have reached a global audience, but whose efforts — sometimes eccentric, but always important — are making real differences on six continents. This year, for the first time, we’re offering a year-end roundup of three of our favorites in condensed form, giving readers the chance to meet for the first time, or get reacquainted with, characters worth knowing. Despite being an outspoken atheist, the Rev. Gretta Vosper has steadfastly maintained her place in the United Church of Canada, Canada’s pre-eminent Protestant church. Although as a child she claimed that Jesus had taught her to skate, Ms. Vosper never considered herself a devotee. Instead, she says she has always understood God obliquely, as love. Divinity school cemented her metaphorical views of God. But once she began preaching, she realized many congregants thought she was talking about an all-knowing, all-seeing spirit who answered prayers and called some to heaven and others to hell. “I realized how little of what I said got through to anyone,” said Ms. Vosper, 61. So four years after she was hired at West Hill United Church in Toronto, she delivered a sermon called “Deconstructing God,” laying bare her disbelief in a theistic God. She recalls congregation members hugging her afterward. “Most of the congregation was in a similar place theologically,” said Debbie Ellis, a member at West Hill, where Ms. Vosper was first hired in 1997. While the policies of the church are propelled more by social justice than theology, and its leadership supported abortion and same-sex union before either became legal in Canada, her stance still stirred an existential passion. She received death threats, one taped to the church’s front door that said, “Suffer the witch not to live.” The local jurisdiction of the church ruled her “unsuitable” for ministry since she “does not believe in God, Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit,” and she was on the verge of being defrocked. David Giuliano, the church’s leader from 2006 to 2009, compared Ms. Vosper to an Amazon manager who doesn’t believe in online shopping. “I suppose someone could have the skills to do it,” he said. “But why would she want to?” But Ms. Vosper’s congregation of self-described agnostics and atheists rallied behind her, and in November 2018, the local jurisdiction agreed that she could continue to minister her congregation in Toronto’s gritty east end. Since then, Ms. Vosper has slowly stripped away the traditional biblical language from her Sunday “weekly gatherings.” In its place, she has put words and rituals reflecting her congregation’s agreed beliefs — love, justice, compassion, integrity, forgiveness. To sit through a service at West Hill United is to feel as if you were watching a classic film that has been dubbed into a different language. Instead of the Lord’s Prayer, the congregation recites the “Words of Commitment,” which Ms. Vosper wrote with her husband, the church’s musical director. They stand to sing humanist hymns dedicated to peace and love that the two also wrote. To her, the close relationships between congregants is the definition of God. “I see us as beams of light between each of us, and that light is a source of strength and encouragement and courage and bravado sometimes and peace and healing,” she said. —Catherine Porter He has been mocked for years in China’s state-controlled news media for being fat, which he isn’t, and denounced more recently as a C.I.A. agent and a member of an American-directed “gang of four” supposedly responsible for orchestrating the Hong Kong protest movement. He says he isn’t those things, either. That China has put so much energy into demonizing Jimmy Lai, 71, is a measure of his singular status as the one prominent businessman in Hong Kong who openly supports antigovernment protests, routinely denounces the Communist Party leader Xi Jinping as a “dictator” and refuses to follow fellow tycoons in paying at least token obeisance to Beijing. As the majority owner of Next Media Group, which publishes Next, a weekly magazine, and Apple Daily, a popular newspaper and website, Mr. Lai has provided a powerful, wide-reaching platform to the mostly young and leaderless protesters. The Chinese Communist Party, which controls two newspapers in the city, has squeezed the revenue of both of Mr. Lai’s publications by pressuring companies not to advertise, which has meant a loss of print revenue of about $44 million. While all of the other prominent tycoons in Hong Kong have stayed silent about the protests or issued statements filled with Communist-style jargon about the need to “resolutely stop the turmoil,” Mr. Lai has not only supported the protesters but has also joined them. “The establishment hates my guts. They ask, ‘Why don’t you just let us make money in peace?’ They think I’m a troublemaker,” he said, adding: “I am a troublemaker, but one with a good conscience.” He has caused further anger by cheering on President Trump, whom he describes as “the only one who plays hardball with China. This is the only thing that China understands.” Born across the border in Guangdong Province, Mr. Lai fled to Hong Kong in a boat as a boy and was a typical success story in the then British-ruled city. He stayed away from politics and diligently worked his way up from lowly jobs as a knitter to become the main owner of Giordano, a successful chain of clothing stores. The 1989 Tiananmen bloodshed, he said, made him start thinking about politics and led to his setting up Next Magazine the following year, a move that quickly hurt his clothing business once he started writing insulting articles about leaders in Beijing. “I had always hoped that China was changing and would become a democracy. I was wrong. It was wishful thinking,” he said. In retaliation, the Chinese authorities began closing his Giordano clothing stores on the mainland. He realized he had to either sell or mind his tongue. He sold everything but his media holdings for nearly $320 million. That experience, he said, has helped him understand why so many of his fellow tycoons toe Beijing’s line. “As a businessman, you can’t confront the regime,” he said. Many business people, he says, do not believe their own statements against the protesters, but feel they have no choice but to show support for Beijing. This, he said, is understandable but also a mistake because China’s leaders “know that once they cow you, they can always cow you.” —Andrew Higgins Zarifa Ghafari, who at 26 became one of Afghanistan’s first female mayors, has said she fully expects to be assassinated. Yet she is not keeping a low profile. After taking office in March in Maidan Shar, a town of 35,000 in Afghanistan’s Wardak Province, she had a banner hoisted with her name, a picture of her wearing a bright red head scarf and the slogan of her anti-littering campaign: “Let’s keep our city clean.” Ms. Ghafari is well aware that she is on the front lines of the struggle for women’s rights in Afghanistan, at a time when American peace talks with the Taliban have Afghans thinking about what might happen if the ultraconservative insurgents take part in running the country again. “My job is to make people believe in women’s rights and women’s power,” she wrote on Twitter. Ms. Ghafari is not the first woman to assume a traditionally male job in Afghanistan’s patriarchal society. But she has one of the toughest imaginable positions. Wardak is a particularly conservative province, where support for the Taliban is widespread. Ms. Ghafari was appointed in the summer of 2018 by Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani. But after a disastrous first day as mayor, her term was delayed for months. After she arrived for work that July day, her office was mobbed by angry men brandishing sticks and rocks. She had to be escorted out by a squad of paramilitary officers. “That was the worst day of my life,” she said. “Don’t come back,” protesters jeered as she left. Ms. Ghafari left town, but not quietly. “I was screaming so much I lost my voice,” she said. She went straight to the presidential palace in Kabul. “I told them I will claim my right to office if I have to set myself on fire in front of the palace,” she said. “It was not an idle threat.” It took nine months, but Ms. Ghafari finally managed to return, and reporters paid a visit to Maidan Shar to see her in action. She took a group of municipal cleaners to distribute plastic trash bags for her clean city campaign. At the bazaar, a crowd of men and boys gathered as soon as she appeared. Garbage was strewn all over the streets, but most refused to take a trash bag. Ms. Ghafari held her ground, demanding that people take the free bags and use them. “It’s our city. We should keep it clean,” she yelled. “I can’t do this without your help.” The daughter of a high school teacher and a colonel in the Afghan special forces, Ms. Ghafari said she had never expected to work in government. She earned her bachelor’s degree in India and was studying for her master’s in economics when, during a visit home last year, her family encouraged her to sit for a civil service exam. She was back in India when a friend called: Mr. Ghani’s office had announced on Facebook that Ms. Ghafari had been named mayor. “I didn’t believe I could get this job, because I am a person with neither political power nor gold,” she said. “But when I did, I knew I wanted to be here and try to change society.” Ms. Ghafari’s doggedness has won grudging respect. In a meeting at the governor’s office, about a road project she has championed, there was a glimmer of support. “Give her some credit,” one of the men present said. “That project was stopped for 12 years, and she is here for a month and it’s restarted. She may be a woman, but she is powerful.” —Fatima Faizi and Rod Nordland']",
Japan to Deploy Destroyer to Middle East,2019-12-27,By Ben Dooley,"['TOKYO — Japan will send defense forces early next year to patrol regional shipping lanes in the Middle East, from which it sources much of its crude oil, the government announced on Friday. The rare overseas deployment, which will be limited to gathering intelligence, is meant to ensure the “security” of Japanese merchant ships and help maintain “peace and stability” in the region, the cabinet office said in a statement. The decision follows a series of attacks on oil tankers in the region, one of which was Japanese-operated.  The announcement also comes a week after a meeting in Tokyo between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, whose country the United States has blamed for attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman in June. The United States has called for an international coalition to protect ships in the region, but only a few of its allies have joined that mission.  The Japanese mission will be independent of any other nation’s deployments in the area, the cabinet office said Friday. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, speaking at a regular news conference, said intelligence-gathering operations could be conducted in “coordination with relevant countries.”  The deployment will include one destroyer, equipped with helicopters, and at least one of two P-3C patrol planes currently engaged in antipiracy operations near Somalia. It will be tasked with collecting information that “directly impacts the security of vessels navigating” the region, according to the cabinet office, which approved the plan on Friday. The mission has been authorized for one year and can be extended.  Japan has been careful to keep up good relations with Iran, and Mr. Abe has positioned himself to act as a possible intermediary between Tehran and Washington. He briefed Mr. Rouhani on Japan’s mission to the Middle East during their meeting, according to NHK, the Japanese national broadcaster.   Japan imports about 90 percent of its crude oil from the Middle East, and “given the rising tensions, it is necessary to strengthen our information collection system for ensuring the safety of Japanese vessels,” Mr. Suga said. Tokyo has come under pressure from President Trump to play a more active role in protecting its interests in the Middle East. Mr. Trump has complained that the country pays “zero compensation” for American patrols of shipping lanes in the region. He has also demanded that Tokyo cover more of the costs of stationing American troops in Japan. Japan’s pacifist Constitution limits its ability to participate in international military coalitions. Mr. Abe has moved to change that, despite public opposition, by issuing a reinterpretation of the Constitution and campaigning to amend it. The new deployment will be limited to the northern Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman and the Gulf of Aden, the cabinet office said. Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force operates a base in Djibouti, which was established in 2011 as a staging area for antipiracy operations. The government is describing the deployment as an “investigation and research” mission. The participating forces are not authorized to use weapons to protect other ships against attack, the cabinet office said.  However, if the situation warrants, the mission could be converted to a “maritime policing operation,” a designation that would allow the destroyer and planes to defend other vessels. The Maritime Self-Defense Force will not patrol the vital shipping lanes that run through the Strait of Hormuz. Analysts said that decision was meant to avoid giving the impression that Japan was taking sides with the United States against Iran, with which it has long maintained friendly relations. The June attack on the Japanese-operated tanker in the Gulf of Oman occurred while Mr. Abe was on an official visit to Iran. The United States blamed the attack on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which the Americans have labeled a terrorist organization. During their meeting last week, Mr. Abe encouraged Mr. Rouhani to adhere to Iran’s commitments under the 2015 agreement that froze its nuclear program, according to NHK.  Iran has been incrementally reducing its commitment to the agreement as it seeks relief from heavy economic sanctions imposed on the country by Mr. Trump, following his decision to withdraw the United States from the pact.

"With Prisoner Swap, Ukraine’s President Inches Toward Peace With Separatists",2019-12-29,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners on Sunday with Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east, the latest sign of a tenuous thaw in relations between Ukraine and Russia. The trade was seen as a success for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has vowed to free all detainees and negotiate a settlement to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. But it came at a high price: to secure its prisoners, Ukraine freed riot police officers who had been accused of shooting protesters during the country’s revolution in 2014, a widely criticized move.  Mr. Zelensky negotiated the swap with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this month at peace talks in Paris that otherwise made little headway in resolving the five-year war. The sides exchanged soldiers, activists and people accused of espionage, some of whom had been languishing in jails for years. It was in an effort last summer to win American support for such diplomacy that Mr. Zelensky sought a White House meeting with President Trump, who in exchange asked for investigations that could help discredit his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The House of Representatives impeached Mr. Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. With the United States — Ukraine’s principal ally — distracted by impeachment proceedings, Mr. Zelensky entered the settlement talks with Russia with a weakened hand. But Mr. Zelensky, who won an election in April on a promise to end the war, has nonetheless been inching toward more stable relations with Russia. Mr. Putin, eager to shake Western resolve on economic sanctions, has accommodated with confidence-building steps, like the prisoner swap. The exchange was initially to be an all-for-all exchange of prisoners, but negotiations unraveled once the lists of detainees were presented. Some prisoners held by Ukraine declined to take part in a trade that would have sent them to live in the isolated, repressive separatist enclaves in the east known as the people’s republics, preferring to serve out their sentences in Ukraine instead. Ukrainian news media reported that 22 people declined to be traded. In response, the pro-Russia side withheld captives. Those who were released crossed a road between the front lines that was swathed in mist on Sunday. Soldiers stood guard, a video released by the Ukrainian government showed. In this swap, as in previous exchanges, detainees became bargaining chips not only to free captives but also to serve strategic goals in the broader conflict. The pro-Russian side requested the release of five Ukrainian riot police officers held for reasons unrelated to the war — they were accused of 48 counts of murder over shootings on Independence Square in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, during mass protests that toppled a pro-Russia president in 2014.  The shootings on the square became a searing moment in Ukraine’s post-Communist history, and families of the victims and Ukrainian nationalists had clamored for years for court convictions that would also become indictments of Russia’s influence in Ukraine. The men were charged but never convicted, and Sunday’s trade seemingly put them out of reach of justice. Mr. Zelensky’s policy of rapprochement with Russia has brought a resumption of peace talks, two prisoner releases and an agreement for Russia to ship natural gas to Europe through Ukrainian pipelines, while prompting protests against policies that critics see as caving to Russian demands.']","Among those traded were riot police officers accused of killing protesters during mass demonstrations in the capital, Kyiv, in 2014.

The CBC’s Cut of a Scene From ‘Home Alone 2’ Draws the Trumps’ Ire,2019-12-27,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — Could Canada’s relations with the United States have taken a turn for the worse after its leading public broadcaster cut a seconds-long scene of President Trump from  “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York?” Canadians were momentarily pondering that unlikely question over the Christmas holidays after the CBC broadcast the 1992 film without a cameo by Mr. Trump. In the scene, the character Kevin McCallister, played by Macaulay Culkin, asks Mr. Trump how to get to the lobby of New York’s ornate Plaza Hotel (which Mr. Trump owned at the time). The CBC said the cut had been made for time’s sake, and before Mr. Trump’s political career, but as the omission drew media attention, Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. posted about it on Thursday on his Instagram account, calling the alteration “absolutely pathetic” and saying it proved that the news media “really are the enemy of the people.” That evening, President Trump himself weighed in, retweeting an article about the edited version and adding an allusion to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada: “I guess Justin T doesn’t much like my making him pay up on NATO or Trade!” A few minutes later, Mr. Trump tweeted a different headline, reporting claims that the incident was an example of censorship. But those Canadians worrying that the perceived slight had undermined relations with Canada’s most important ally felt relief on Thursday evening when Mr. Trump injected a note of humor to his commentary. “The movie will never be the same! (just kidding),” he wrote on Twitter. On Friday, Mr. Trudeau’s office declined to comment on the incident. The CBC, for its part, said the scene with Mr. Trump had been cut in 2014, before he declared his candidacy for president in 2015, and thus was not politically motivated. “CBC’s airing of Home Alone 2 was edited for time,” Chuck Thompson, a spokesman for the broadcaster, wrote on Twitter. “This happens regularly with films adapted for television. The scene with Donald Trump was one of several that were cut from the movie as none of them were integral to the plot.” Mr. Trudeau, a progressive known for his advocacy of women’s rights and the fight against climate change, has had a somewhat rocky relationship with Mr. Trump, who last year called him “very dishonest and weak.” More recently, he called Mr. Trudeau “two-faced” after the prime minister had been caught on video apparently gossiping about Mr. Trump with other world leaders at a NATO reception at Buckingham Palace. Before the latest brouhaha, Mr. Trump said this week that it had been an honor to be in the film. He mentioned the movie during a video conference call from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with members of the United States military. “A lot of people mention it every year, especially around Christmas,’’ he said. “They say, ‘I just saw you.’ Especially young kids, they say, ‘I just saw you on the movie.’ And it turned out to be a very big hit, obviously. It’s a big Christmas hit — one of the biggest. So it’s an honor to be involved in something like that. You always like to see success.” Some of Mr. Trump’s supporters lashed out at the Canadian broadcaster. “CBC TV in Canada has cut Donald Trump’s Home Alone 2 cameo out of their broadcast,” Ryan Fournier, the chairman of a pro-Trump student group, wrote on Twitter. “They’re so triggered by him that they had to edit him out of the film. Absolutely pathetic.” On the television program “Fox & Friends,” the co-host Ed Henry accused the CBC of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.” “I think they’re actually terrified that people will remember that before he was the new Hitler, he was actually a beloved mainstream cultural figure,” the commentator Mark Steyn added on the show. “I think they’re terrified of these little things that will remind people of just how deranged his opponents are.” But others commended the cut, including George Conway, a lawyer who is a vociferous critic of Mr. Trump and the husband of his adviser Kellyanne Conway. “You see, Senators? It’s not that hard,” he wrote on Twitter, apparently alluding to Congress’s impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is expected to face a trial early next year in the Senate, where his acquittal in the Republican-controlled chamber appears likely. Michael Crowley contributed reporting from West Palm Beach, Fla.']","The Canadian broadcaster said it removed the cameo for the sake of time five years ago.

"Blocked in U.S., Huawei Touts ‘Shared Values’ to Compete in Europe",2019-12-27,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — The committee room of the European Parliament was crowded with lawmakers and lobbyists who were facing off with executives of the telecommunications giant Huawei. One lawmaker, eager to raise the trust issue, got directly to the point: Could Huawei be a front for Chinese state espionage? Abraham Liu, the company’s top official in Europe, pushed right back. Huawei, he said, is completely independent, with no obligation to spy for China, and to do so “would be like committing suicide.”  Then he added a twist — and a veiled swipe at Huawei’s loudest critic, the Trump administration: It is Huawei, not America, that shares European principles. “Europe’s values of openness, innovation and the rule of law have led to it being a powerhouse in mobile communications — and Huawei shares these values,” Mr. Liu said. In Washington, Huawei is treated like a grave security risk over concerns that Chinese intelligence agencies could use the company’s technology to infiltrate the systems of foreign customers. Yet in Brussels, the European Union’s de facto capital, the company is waging a multifaceted charm offensive, partly by exploiting European distrust toward the Trump administration — and, for now, it is working. As the company competes to build Europe’s next-generation 5G wireless networks, Huawei is spending millions of dollars on an intensive advertising and lobbying campaign, while making a bold argument to European policymakers: That while the Trump administration is unpredictable and unreliable, Huawei is a guarantor of privacy, transparency and globalization.  The message hasn’t gone unnoticed, nor has the irony. “The Chinese have started brazenly claiming that it is China, not the United States, that shares more values with Europe,” said Julianne Smith of the German Marshall Fund in Washington. “Chinese scholars and officials also frequently remind European audiences that unlike the United States, China believes in climate change and multilateralism, a message that is especially powerful in a place like Germany,” she said. To push its message, Huawei has made unexpected moves. One is the hearing, in October, in which Mr. Liu spoke about values. It was not a case of a corporate leader being hauled before lawmakers for a grilling. Instead, Huawei had organized the “public debate” with members of the European Parliament, live-streamed the proceeding and posted the video online. In the United States, the Trump administration has essentially blocked Huawei, but Mr. Trump’s efforts to push European allies to ban Huawei have fallen flat.  Neither the European Union nor individual countries have moved to restrict the company’s access to their markets. Hungary, whose far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, identifies himself as a Trump ally, announced in November that Huawei would lead its 5G infrastructure rollout.Even as government officials have debated its role, Huawei has forged ahead, and says it has already made dozens of deals to sell 5G hardware to wireless carriers across Europe. The extent of its involvement is unclear, because a single carrier can buy gear from multiple vendors, and some pieces of equipment are more security-sensitive than others. And at a NATO gathering near London this month, when Mr. Trump pressed Prime Minister Boris Johnson to shut Huawei out of Britain, Mr. Johnson — who has postponed a decision on the question — was noncommittal. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an opinion piece published by Politico Europe, implored policymakers “not to give control of their critical infrastructure to Chinese tech giants.” To a degree, European policymakers in charge of assessing risks to cybersecurity share the United States’ concerns about Huawei. A recent European Union report highlighted, without naming Huawei, that a non-European 5G technology provider could be forced to allow its government to hack into and even control its networks, enabling access to private data, trade secrets and national security operations. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that Huawei should be allowed to compete for 5G contracts, but other politicians have pushed back, indicating that the company could be in for a fight there. “No Chinese company is an independent company,” Norbert Röttgen, a former government minister from Ms. Merkel’s party, said recently, adding that Huawei’s involvement was “an imminent question of national security.” Yet one German telecommunication company, Telefonica Deutschland, has announced that it intends to contract Huawei for its 5G development. European Union rules make it difficult to target individual companies for political reasons. The bloc could impose stringent standards of conduct and openness for 5G contractors that could be used to restrict Huawei but, as yet, has simply let each member country to decide how to proceed. Distrust toward the Trump administration is also a significant factor, as European policymakers worry that American sanctions on Huawei are simply a bargaining chip in the United States’ broader trade war with China and might be reversed. “There is a fear that if you take what potentially are quite expensive decisions with regards to 5G because the Americans have told you that they are a security problem, and then President Trump gets a trade deal with China and suddenly Huawei is all O.K. again, then you’ll feel like the earth has moved under your feet,” said Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Center for European Reform, a policy group in London. Years before the advent of 5G, Huawei was establishing a major presence in Europe, where it ranks third in mobile phone sales, behind Samsung and Apple. The company says it has 12,000 employees, and 23 research and development centers in Europe, a way of building favor and familiarity with policymakers. And it has moved boldly to position itself in Brussels. Huawei has spent more than $3 million this year on advertising and lobbying, according to its disclosures in the European Union lobbying registry. That is more than the combined spending of its European 5G competitors, Ericsson and Nokia, and far more than its American rival, Qualcomm. In a huge advertising campaign this year, the company plastered banners featuring happy faces at Brussels Airport and in key spots around the city. “Vote for 5G,” they read. “#Vote Smarter.” In a press packet sent to hundreds of journalists there, Huawei argued that “It is crucial to roll out 5G the European way, in line with European values.” Huawei, it added, was best placed to guarantee those values. The company also placed advertising in the most insider-focused journalism product in town, Politico Europe’s daily newsletter. “Brussels Playbook, presented by Huawei — Vote for 5G,” the subject line of an early-morning email read in late May this year. Huawei has made donations to at least two major research institutions in Brussels that study European policy. Several other institutions receive funding from the Chinese government.  For Huawei, public records show that the amounts are relatively small, about $55,000 per organization. But they guarantee that the company is a player in the Brussels policy machinery. In an interview, Mr. Liu said the company spent money on advertising and lobbying because of “attacks from the U.S. toward Huawei.” He said the company was “obliged to talk to the stakeholders in Europe and also the rest of the word, because the U.S. is very powerful — the U.S. government is super-powerful.” “They’re trying to murder us,” he said. In many ways, Huawei is using the Brussels playbook of major American technology players like Google, which has pioneered the use of public advertising campaigns in Brussels to influence legislation or regulations. The two companies even share a small, unassuming office building three blocks from the European Commission, where Google occupies three floors and Huawei one. A review of the European Commission’s transparency register shows that Huawei employees met with top officials from the Commission, including commissioners and their top civil servants or members of their cabinets, 46 times in the past five years. The vast majority of those meetings were about 5G, the register shows. Mr. Liu says his company’s continued presence in Europe demonstrates Washington’s failure to show any concrete evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei. “It’s not fair on us as a private company to face such a challenge from a superpower,” he said. “And for Europe, we appreciate that the European stakeholders take a different approach.”']","The Chinese tech giant is spending millions of dollars on a charm offensive in Brussels, hoping for a leading role in building 5G networks. It seems to be working."
Putin Thanks Trump for Helping Russia Thwart Terrorist Attack,2019-12-29,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called President Trump on Sunday to thank him for a tip from American intelligence agencies that helped prevent a terrorist attack in Russia, the Kremlin said in a statement. The announcement offered no details about what information the United States had passed along. But the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the K.G.B., told Russian media it had detained two suspects preparing an attack on a crowded location in the northern city of St. Petersburg on New Year’s Eve. The two countries’ spy agencies typically view one another as adversaries, for example backing opposing sides in wars in Ukraine and, until earlier this year, in Syria. But when it comes to counterterrorism, they cooperate. Two years ago, Mr. Putin thanked Mr. Trump for information about another planned attack, also in St. Petersburg. And on Sunday, the Kremlin statement said Mr. Putin had again thanked Mr. Trump for “information transmitted through the channels of U.S. special services.” It said the two leaders had also discussed other “issues of mutual interest,” but did not spell them out. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Some of the terrorist groups tracked by the United States have also targeted Russia for years, among them the Islamic State. In 2015, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian airliner over Egypt, killing all 224 people aboard. Information has also flowed to the United States from Russia. In 2011, the Federal Security Service warned the F.B.I. that an immigrant from Russia living in Boston, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had associated with Islamist militants. The F.B.I. investigated the tip but closed the case after finding no proof.  Two years later, Mr. Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar detonated homemade bombs at the Boston Marathon.']",The Russian president called the American president to thank him for a tip about an attack said to be aimed at St. Petersburg. 
ISIS Affiliate in Nigeria Releases a Video Showing 11 Executions,2019-12-28,By Ruth Maclean and Eric Schmitt,"['DAKAR, Senegal — An affiliate of the Islamic State in Nigeria has claimed responsibility for the execution of 11 people, saying the killings were in retaliation for the death of the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria in October. A video released on Thursday showed members of the Nigerian affiliate slashing the throats of 10 people and shooting an additional person. A voice-over says the killings are a “message for Christians” and that all of those killed were Christian, although Nigerian experts said some of them were probably Muslims, based on previous episodes involving the group. The Islamic State, or ISIS, has lost all of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, but it remains a threat even after Mr. al-Baghdadi was killed in an American raid on his hide-out in northwestern Syria. In addition to the affiliate in Nigeria, which is known as the Islamic State West Africa Province, groups in the Philippines, Afghanistan, Sinai and the Sahel, a 3,000-mile stretch of land south of the Sahara, also claim allegiance to ISIS. The members of the Islamic State West Africa Province, which is known by the acronym ISWAP, left the Islamic militant group Boko Haram in 2016. According to the International Crisis Group, it has between 3,500 and 5,000 fighters. Its leaders split from Boko Haram in part because they disapproved of the violence that the group and its harsh leader, Abubakar Shekau, has meted out to Muslims, according to analysts. The executions could herald a possible return to the harsher methods of Boko Haram, according to experts. Abdulbasit Kassim, a co-author of “The Boko Haram Reader: From Nigerian Preachers to the Islamic State,” said that other Islamic State provinces had released videos of revenge for the killing of Mr. al-Baghdadi. Mr. Kassim said there was a strong possibility that ISWAP was under pressure to do the same. “I think there’s a demand from IS Central: ‘ISWAP, where is your submission for revenge for Baghdadi?’” said Mr. Kassim, referring to the main body of the Islamic State. He added that he believed ISWAP was making two types of propaganda, one aimed at obtaining ransoms from the Nigerian government, and one to satisfy Islamic State demands. The video was released to Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who often publishes information about both ISWAP and Boko Haram. According to Mr. Salkida, ISWAP had shown interest in negotiating a prisoner swap, but abruptly changed course and executed the prisoners instead.  The 56-second video shows the captives, who were blindfolded and wearing orange tunics, kneeling on the ground, their captors standing behind them in black balaclavas. A fighter in the middle lifts a handgun and shoots the prisoner in front of him in the head. The video then cuts to the fighters standing behind the other 10 prisoners. Holding each captive by the face or hair, the fighters slit their throats. In the version of the video seen by The New York Times, which was published on Amaq, an ISIS propaganda arm, a man speaks over the recording. “This message is to the Christians in the world,” he says in both Arabic and Hausa, a Nigerian language, according to the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadists and white supremacists. “Those who you see in front of us are Christians, and we will shed their blood as revenge for the two dignified sheikhs, the caliph of the Muslims, and the spokesman for the Islamic State, Sheikh Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, may Allah accept them.”  A day after the death of Mr. Baghdadi, considered the caliph by his followers, the man thought likely to be his successor, Mr. al-Muhajir, the group’s spokesman, was killed in a separate raid. Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he thought that “I.S. is trying to grab headlines during the holidays when usually there isn’t much news.” The State Department condemned the attacks. “We are appalled by the vicious ISIS-West Africa attack targeting Christians in Nigeria,” Tibor Nagy, the State Department’s top Africa policy official, said in a Twitter message. President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria said in a statement, “These barbaric killers don’t represent Islam and millions of other law-abiding Muslims around the world.”  There has been an upsurge in violence in northeast Nigeria over the past year, and particularly in the last six months, contributing to a deteriorating humanitarian situation there, with armed groups setting up checkpoints to target and abduct civilians, the United Nation’s humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, Antonio Canhandula, said this week. In Burkina Faso, another West African country plagued by groups of armed militants, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on Tuesday that killed seven soldiers that it said ISWAP fighters had carried out. Tens of thousands of civilians, the majority of them Muslim, have been killed by both Islamist militants and Nigerian security forces in three northeastern states of Nigeria since 2009. Ruth Maclean reported from Dakar and Eric Schmitt from New York.']",The grisly footage shows fighters aligned with the Islamic State cutting the throats of 10 prisoners and shooting an 11th captive.
‘The Pendulum Has Swung Back’: Latin America’s Corruption Fight Stalls,2019-12-28,By Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — The biggest corruption investigation in Latin America history began, humbly enough, at a Brazilian gas station, but as it steamrollered across the region, it took down top government officials and corporate titans alike. For those caught up in the scandal, it was a moment of reckoning. For ordinary citizens, it was something else: a moment of hope. Even the most powerful, it appeared, were finally being held to account. Now, five years after the scandal exploded into public view, the region’s drive against corruption has begun to stall.  “For a brief moment in time, everyone was within the reach of justice,” said Thelma Aldaña, a former attorney general of Guatemala who indicted the country’s president and vice president in a corruption case in 2015 and became one of the emblematic figures of the crackdown.  That crackdown came after years of high commodities prices that buoyed  many economies in the region, lifting millions out of poverty — but also feeding government spending and therefore opportunities for graft. When that period of plenty ended, it left government officials vulnerable, and prosecutors free to pursue the powerful.  In Peru, former President Alan García shot himself to death rather than face arrest. In Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president who remained the country’s most commanding political figure, was sentenced to time in prison, as was Marcelo Odebrecht, the head of Latin America’s largest construction conglomerate.  But efforts to adopt anti-corruption reforms sputtered amid political pressure. As discredited figures in business and politics mount comebacks, many of those who led the crusade against graft face retaliation. Ms. Aldaña, who is now in exile, faces death threats at home. The task force that enabled her country’s corruption fight was shut down.  “The pendulum went to one side, and now the pendulum has swung back,” said Deltan Dallagnol, the federal prosecutor who led Brazil’s main anti-corruption task force. It was established in 2014 to prosecute cases from the scandal that came to be known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, after the gas station in Brazil’s capital, Brasília. All this has helped fuel widespread anger and distrust of the political establishment. Millions of Latin Americans have voted out incumbents and over the past few months have poured into the streets in enormous protests. In some cases, the credibility of efforts to fight graft was undermined by transgressions committed by the crusaders themselves. In Brazil, leaked cellphone text messages showed the main judge in the investigation giving strategic guidance to federal prosecutors in what criminal procedure experts saw as a clear violation of legal and ethical guidelines. Brazil’s backsliding on corruption may be the most dramatic and consequential in the region, given how much prosecutors accomplished in a few years. The Car Wash task force has filed charges against 476 people, struck 136 plea agreements and recovered more than $900 million in stolen assets. Brazilian companies with projects around the region exported the corruption scheme they had perfected at home. The companies used money-laundering operations — such as the one that operated out of the gas station in Brasília — to clear cash used to pay off high-ranking politicians and parties. In exchange for the money, inflated public works contracts were steered the companies’ way.  Chief among these companies was Odebrecht, a Brazil-based construction conglomerate that paid more than $780 million in bribes across Latin American and the Caribbean to capture contracts worth $3.34 billion, according to the United States Justice Department. The scandal upended politics in Brazil, where every large party was implicated in illegal campaign finance and kickback schemes. The arrest and eventual imprisonment of Mr. da Silva, the former president, for accepting the use of a seaside apartment in exchange for steering government contracts represented a turning point for the country.  For some, seeing Brazil’s most commanding political figure in jail was the culmination of the anti-corruption drive and evidence that the law was finally being applied equally to everyone. For others, it was evidence that the investigation was politically contaminated and beginning to backslide into the influence trading it was intended to remedy. The unusual zeal and speed with which the leftist firebrand’s case was handled made it politically fraught: When Mr. da Silva was imprisoned in April of last year to start serving a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering, he was the front-runner in the presidential race. The conviction blocked him from the ballot and paved the way for the election of the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro. Suspicion that the prosecution was politically motivated only grew after Sérgio Moro, the judge who handled Mr. da Silva’s case, joined President Bolsonaro’s cabinet as justice minister. That appointment — which came with a promise of an eventual seat on the Supreme Court — outraged politicians on the left and tarnished the image of Mr. Moro, who had become a folk hero at home and a celebrated jurist abroad. “If there’s one thing a judge needs, that is autonomy from the political establishment,” said Margarita Stolbizer, a former lawmaker in Argentina and prominent activist against graft who said she was astonished by Mr. Moro’s decision to join Mr. Bolsonaro’s cabinet. “I felt he defrauded us, considering the image he sold of himself.” Mr. Moro declined a request for an interview. In response to emailed questions, some of which he did not answer, he said he saw the cabinet post as an opportunity to “consolidate the advances that have been made on anti-corruption and extend them to the fight against organized crime and violent crimes.” Mr. Moro’s legacy suffered a further blow when The Intercept Brasil, an online news outlet, began reporting in June on a trove of leaked text messages exchanged by federal prosecutors. The messages showed that Mr. Moro had provided guidance to the prosecution in Mr. da Silva’s case. The leaked messages were a boon to targets of corruption inquiries. “The disclosure of the chats left the Car Wash prosecutors bleeding, and the sharks smelled blood,” said Bruno Brandão, the executive director of Transparency International in Brazil. “What we’re seeing now are major and simultaneous strikes that represent a real threat of a return to the impunity the elites enjoyed historically.” As a candidate, Mr. Bolsonaro vowed to turbocharge the fight against corruption. His willingness to make good on that pledge was tested soon after his election in October 2018. By December, his son Flávio Bolsonaro, a senator, had become a target of a corruption investigation set off by suspicious financial transactions at his former office in the Rio de Janeiro state legislature. Months later, federal prosecutors cried foul over Mr. Bolsonaro’s protocol-breaking appointment of the new attorney general. The president has traditionally picked the attorney general from a list put forward by the national association of federal prosecutors. This system was intended to prevent a president from picking a deferential top law enforcement official, since that person oversees corruption inquiries involving elected officials, including the president. Mr. Bolsonaro instead picked his own man, a move that the prosecutors’ association called “the biggest democratic and institutional setback” for the office in 20 years. With the authority of law enforcement officials curbed, major graft cases in Brazil are stalled or moving at a glacial pace as powerful defendants appeal convictions and use legal tactics to put off prison sentences. Eike Batista,  once one of the world’s top 10 richest men, was sentenced in July 2018 to 30 years in prison for paying millions in bribes, but he has yet to start serving time. Former President Michel Temer remains free despite a flurry of criminal charges that have dogged him since 2017. They include an instance in which Mr. Temer was surreptitiously recorded condoning the payment of a bribe to keep a former political ally from detailing crimes to the authorities. The backsliding in Brazil has been watched closely across the region, where politicians have largely prioritized self-preservation over measures that would make judiciaries more independent, campaign financing more transparent and the public works contract process less prone to bribery. In Guatemala, President Jimmy Morales shut down a United Nations panel of experts that had been helping the attorney general’s office build complex, sensitive corruption cases. The decision came after Mr. Morales, who campaigned under the motto “neither corrupt nor a thief,” came under investigation for allegedly receiving illegal campaign contributions. The government of Honduras, which had signed off on the establishment of a similar entity there in 2016, this year declined to renew its mandate. Those models enjoyed widespread public support in 2016, when the United States Justice Department announced that Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction company, had agreed to pay a $3.5 billion penalty after confessing that it had set up a department to bribe politicians across the region to secure public works contracts. The founder  of the company, Marcelo Odebrecht, struck a plea deal with prosecutors in Brazil and served two and a half years in prison. The company then extended an offer to the  countries where it had paid bribes: In exchange for immunity from new prosecutions, it said, it would disclose the money paid and the contracts secured fraudulently. Some countries — including Ecuador, Peru and the Dominican Republic — took Odebrecht up on its offer, and saw former presidents arrested as a result. But in Colombia and Argentina, a lack of political will has prevented investigations into Odebrecht’s corruption from advancing. Vice President Marta Lucía Ramírez of Colombia called the failure to crack open the Odebrecht case deeply troubling in a country that has been roiled in recent days by mass protests. “It has very serious consequences, and it’s seriously undermining people’s trust in institutions, political parties, Congress and the justice system,” she said. “That puts the future of democracy in jeopardy.” In Brazil, several of the figures who were among the first to be imprisoned for their involvement in the Car Wash scandal are now free and rebuilding their lives. Among them is Nelma Kodama, a black-market currency trader sentenced to 18 years in prison. Her term was reduced by President Temer, who spent much of his time in office fending off corruption charges of his own. Ms. Kodama, who became infamous for posting a photo of her court-ordered ankle bracelet alongside red Chanel shoes, said in an interview that Car Wash, at the end of the day, had failed to upend the culture of corruption. While it made an example of several high-profile people, she said, the crackdown did more damage than good by deepening the recession that began in 2014 and crippling some of Brazil’s largest companies. “The operation was a failure,” said Ms. Kodama, who recently published a memoir detailing how she helped launder money for years and the indignities she endured in prison. “It didn’t end corruption, and left the country with a crazy level of unemployment.”']","A drive against graft that started in Brazil left many hoping for a fairer, more equal region.

Highlights From a Year of Traveling Across Canada,2019-12-27,By Ian Austen,"['While it’s not vacation travel, one of the great privileges of my job is regularly seeing various parts of Canada. Often, that means going to places well off the typical tourist track. And, just as frequently, those communities prove to be the most interesting destinations. On almost every trip, I stumble across discoveries big and small that are completely unrelated to the article that has lured me out. Before going over some highlights from this year, I should note that nearly all the people I approach while on assignment are happy to speak with me and generous with their time.  There are exceptions, of course: in communities at the heart of a major news story where many residents come to feel under siege and retreat, to use an understandable example. And often during interviews anywhere in the country, I run into people who become more open once they learn that I’m Canadian and not, as they had assumed, American. After many years, I’m still not entirely sure what that’s about. But, on the whole, we are a nation that is welcoming to strangers and keen to tell its stories. And before I go through a partial list of small, but welcome, surprises from my travels, I would like to offer my best wishes to all Canada Letter readers and their families for 2020. — When time permits, I try to pay at least a quick visit to any history museum I come across. Sometimes that provides context for my stories. It always sates my curiosity. After many years of not having time during its open hours to visit the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, I finally made it inside this fall. It’s a great place. But what really distinguishes the Glenbow is its approach to an issue many museums are facing: how to present the story of Indigenous people in Canada within institutions largely built around the experiences of the people who came here from Europe and the rest of the world. The Glenbow takes several approaches. Most prominent is a large and brilliant gallery in which the Niitsitapi or Blackfoot people tell their own history. It’s worth the price of admission on its own.  In a nearby gallery is a multimedia installation by Kent Monkman, the Toronto artist of Cree ancestry, on the near extinction of the American bison during the 19th century because of overhunting by white settlers. But the representation of Indigenous people doesn’t stop there. Each of the museum’s other history galleries has a large panel offering “A First Nations Perspective” on a topic.  While reconciliation with Indigenous people remains more of a goal than a reality in Canada, the Glenbow and other museums are at least taking first steps. — Most Canadians know about skating on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa (crews began flooding its surface earlier this week only to have a thaw undo their efforts). And in recent years, the capital has been in a friendly competition with Winnipeg about which city has the longest or biggest or greatest skating trail. But while in Sudbury, Ontario, early this year, I discovered that it is also a hub of recreational skating. Not far from my hotel in the Little Britain neighborhood was the Queen’s Athletic Skating Oval. On the snowy evening when I wandered over, the wide and less than perfectly shaped oval, which is surfaced with a Zamboni, was disproportionately being enjoyed by novice adult skaters, many apparently newcomers to Canada as well as skates.  Then out by the campus of Laurentian University, about 1.5 kilometers of Ramsey Lake are cleared and flooded to create a skate path.  Alas, I hadn’t packed my skates before heading to Sudbury so I was only a spectator. — O.K., I was very late to this game but I finally made it to The Forks in Winnipeg this spring. Now arguably best known as the home of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, the former railway yard where the Red and Assiniboine Rivers meet has become Winnipeg’s meeting place. Despite somewhat chilly temperatures when I headed over for dinner on a weekday, the place was packed. But The Forks is not just about eating, shopping and entertainment. Throughout the site, Parks Canada presents its history in various novel ways. The wall beside a path sloping down to the water is lined with an archaeological timeline.  Many cities have projects similar in some aspects to The Forks. Few are as obviously successful. — This year, I returned to Lac Mégantic, Quebec. I was there six years ago when the explosions and fires set off by the derailment of a runaway oil train killed 47 people and incinerated the community’s lakeside downtown. I had gone back, along with photographer Ian Willms, as part of a series we call Promises Made that follows up on the aftermath of disasters. The short version is that I found the progress both on rail safety and the rebuilding of Lac Mégantic has been frustratingly slow. You can read the entire report here.  As they were during their time of crisis and despite the lingering trauma, the people I met in Lac Mégantic were hospitable and open. Because I drove from Ottawa, I brought a bike along. On the day I left town, I rose early to do a 56-kilometer-long variation of a ride around the lake that shares its name with the town. The “Grand Tour,” as it’s called on its route signs, was light on traffic and heavy on spectacular scenery.  Before the fire, tourism was one of Lac Mégantic’s major industries, along with the production of particle board used by Sweden’s most famous retailer to make bookcases and desks. The disaster, however, has kept many visitors away. The scenery, the parks, the lake, the camping, cycling and hiking remain as terrific as Lac Mégantic’s citizens remain welcoming. Pay them a visit if you can. L’Express, the Montreal bistro, is about to celebrate its 40th anniversary. But the food writer Brett Anderson writes that “it contains part of the source code for the approachable bistros and brasseries that have transformed American fine dining in the last 25 years.” For Travel, Mike Arnot looked into the electric powered seaplane now being tested by Harbour Air in Vancouver. “Someone was going to do it someday, so it may as well be us,” the small airline’s founder said.

Mexican Police Chief Arrested in Massacre of Mormon Family,2019-12-27,By Elisabeth Malkin,"['MEXICO CITY — The police chief of a small town near Mexico’s border with the United States has been arrested on suspicion that he was involved in the massacre of nine women and children of a Mormon family last month, the Mexican authorities said Friday. The federal authorities arrested Fidel Alejandro Villegas, the police chief in the town of Janos in the state of Chihuahua, as part of their investigation into the Nov. 4 attack in a remote region in the neighboring state of Sonora. Mr. Villegas was arrested this week on suspicion of protecting organized crime in the region and of colluding in the killings, a spokesman for Mexico’s Public Security Ministry said. He is the fourth person to be arrested on suspicion of participating in the murder of the three women and six children, members of a binational Mormon community that farms land in northern Mexico. The case has reverberated across the border, with President Trump once threatening to designate Mexican organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations.  The women and children, dual citizens of Mexico and the United States, were traveling in sports utility vehicles on a remote country road when they were attacked by gunmen believed to belong to an organized crime group. Federal officials have said that they are investigating the possibility that the victims were mistaken for members of a rival group. The F.B.I. has worked with the Mexican authorities in the investigation. Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the victims, said that the arrest of the Janos police chief confirms that Mexican law enforcement often collaborates with organized crime. “It’s common knowledge down here that the police work with the criminals,” he said by telephone from Chihuahua. “They have a monopoly on security and they get paid a wage for protection, and later we find out that they participate in the murder of women and children,” he said. “These people take resources to protect us and they are murderers themselves.” Mexico is about to close its most violent year on record, with 32,600 murders reported through November. The violence is proving to be the biggest challenge to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has centered his crime-fighting strategy around a new law enforcement agency, the National Guard, and promised that an emphasis on social policies would address the root causes of crime. But the National Guard proved to be of little help on the day the members of the extended LeBarón and Langford families were killed. The authorities did not arrive at the scene until 10 hours later, Mr. LeBarón said. “I’ve been marching in Mexico and speaking out against the violence,’’ he said. “And I have never seen a case where a victim has had justice.” Mr. LeBarón’s brother was killed 10 years ago when he stood up to local gangs and nobody has been tried for that crime, he said. “The justice system has collapsed,” he said. “The impunity rate is almost 100 percent.”']","The killings of three women and six children, members of a binational community that farms land in northern Mexico, reverberated worldwide."
Climate Change and Political Chaos: A Deadly Mix in Honduras Dengue Epidemic,2019-12-29,By Kirk Semple,"['CHOLOMA, Honduras — More than 400 people died this year as one of the worst dengue epidemics on record swept through Central America — a type of outbreak that some scientists and public health officials are warning is likely to become more frequent and more widespread because of climate change.  But while climate change is threatening to increase the spread of dengue worldwide by expanding the range of the mosquitoes that carry the virus, the disease has already found an especially fertile breeding ground in Honduras, for reasons that go beyond the environment.  In Honduras, which accounted for more than 40 percent of the dengue deaths in Central America this year, according to the Pan American Health Organization, the effects of climate change have been compounded by government dysfunction, political tumult and public apathy. Dengue has hit the country hard. This year, it had more than 107,000 cases of the viral disease — more than 13 times the number recorded last year — and at least 175 deaths. In 2018, only three people in Honduras died from the disease, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Honduras’s notorious criminality has worsened matters, too, as public health teams, already stretched thin by budget cuts and a lack of trained personnel, have been blocked by gangs from entering some of the most severely afflicted neighborhoods to educate residents and fumigate against mosquito infestations. Dengue is transmitted to humans by a type of mosquito called Aedes, which thrives in urban areas of the world’s tropical and subtropical regions. Tens of millions of cases occur each year in more than 100 countries, and symptoms may include fever, internal bleeding and shock. Inadequately treated, the illness can quickly kill. In Honduras, health officials trace the start of the current epidemic to the fall of 2018. The number of incidents then rose sharply during the first half of 2019, hitting a peak this summer before falling off as the year ended. A nationwide health emergency declared in July by the administration of President Juan Orlando Hernández remains in effect. The outbreak struck during a time of political turbulence in Honduras, with violent street protests against Mr. Hernández and calls for his ouster. Some of the protests have been driven by fears the government planned to privatize the health and education sectors.  The nation also suffers from high murder rates and widespread poverty, which have combined to drive tens of thousands of Hondurans in recent years to emigrate, with many trying to make it to the United States. The dengue outbreak has met little resistance from a public health system gutted by budget cuts and pervasive corruption, analysts and officials said. “It’s a collapsed system, an inefficient system,” said Ismael Zepeda, an economist with Fosdeh, a research group in Tegucigalpa, the capital. Surveillance programs intended to detect outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases were feeble. The nation’s poorly supplied and understaffed medical facilities lacked the capacity to adequately handle even the nation’s normal demands, much less an epidemic of historic proportions requiring a fast, highly organized response. “In another country there would be many sick but not as many deaths,” said Eduardo Ortíz, an adviser on sustainable development and environmental health for the Pan American Health Organization in Honduras. “The cure for dengue is political.” The epidemic in Honduras has been particularly brutal in the northern department, or province, of Cortés, the industrial heartland of Honduras. It got started early in this region and spread quickly through its main cities, San Pedro Sula and Choloma.  Cortés then became a kind of engine for the national crisis, officials said, as its large migratory population of factory workers helped spread the disease to other regions on visits home, officials said. The epidemic has had a particularly devastating impact on Cortés’s low-income neighborhoods, which suffer from overburdened and ill-equipped public services and poor health care resources.  The epidemic caught Wendy Carcamo and her family unaware early this year.  Though the outbreak had already begun to bedevil Honduras, Ms. Carcamo said she knew little about it. Then one day in February, her son, Jostin Pineda, 7, suddenly fell ill.  “All day he was happy,” Ms. Carcamo recalled of her son. But by nightfall he was suffering a brutal headache and a high fever.  In the ensuing days, Ms. Carcamo said, Jostin’s illness was misdiagnosed by doctors at three local, private health clinics in a poor sector of Choloma. The last doctor referred the boy to the main public hospital in San Pedro Sula. But by then the disease was too far along, and he died the following morning. It’s a story of missed opportunities that has become remarkably common during this outbreak in Honduras. “As a parent, I wasn’t well prepared,” Ms. Carcamo said. “And as doctors, they weren’t well-prepared.” She added: “Everything happened too fast.” Dr. Dinorah Nolasco, the regional health director in Cortés, acknowledged that one of the main factors contributing to the epidemic’s spread was the shortage of trained personnel focused on prevention, education and response. “In the face of the virus and its speed, we weren’t prepared,” she said. Dr. Nolasco said her teams also had difficulty getting access to certain neighborhoods where armed gangs hold sway and harbor a suspicion of outsiders, particularly from the government. In the poor, violent neighborhood of López Arellano in Choloma, Dr. Nolasco’s teams were blocked for months by gang members from getting into certain areas and were unable to survey for mosquito breeding grounds, educate residents or fumigate.  Government personnel were able to secure regular access only after Dr. Nolasco held a series of meetings with community leaders, who then negotiated with gang leaders. By then, however, López Arellano had already become a dengue hot spot, with thousands of infections. Access remains a fraught issue. One worker for the health ministry has had to pay bribes to gang members — in small amounts of cash or marijuana — to do her work. While better governance and bigger budgets would have helped contain the Honduran epidemic, scientists and public health experts say, they also point to another factor that might have contributed to the intensity and scope of the outbreak: meteorological conditions that are beyond the ability of one country to mitigate.  Honduras this year endured a drought so severe that it merited an emergency declaration in September by the government. But the nation also suffered bouts of unexpectedly intense rainfall, part of a pattern of increasing weather variability that climate scientists say is most likely related to climate change. Some of this variability has created conditions that, in the absence of a strong governmental program of disease control, has allowed dengue to flourish. During periods of extreme drought, residents living in neighborhoods without a reliable public water supply — as is the case in much of Honduras — will sometimes store water in their homes, providing more potential mosquito breeding sites. And during heavy rainfall, flooding can provide more breeding environments, particularly in areas with poor drainage systems. “With climate change, we have rainy periods where there were once dry periods, dry periods when there was rain,” Dr. Nolasco lamented. “Before we had three cycles of spraying. Now we have to spray year-round.” But experts caution that no single epidemic can be attributed wholly to climate change. “In general, climate change is one of the multitude of factors affecting dengue,” said Rachel Lowe, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who researches the connection between climate and the spread of diseases. Honduran public health officials are particularly worried about apathy, an enduring problem throughout the epidemic, particularly among poor, vulnerable populations. “People are thinking about other problems,” said Dr. Nolasco, the regional health director. “If I’m a mother and I have three children, four children, I’m going to be thinking about what I’m going to feed them, whether my son is running with the gangs. They’ll be thinking least of all about dengue.” During a visit to López Arellano this month, Dr. Nolasco stopped by the home of one family that had lost a child to dengue. She inspected a basin where water was stored for washing clothes and found hundreds of mosquito larvae swimming around. She found the same thing at a house across the street. “How do you educate the population?” she said later, frustration in her voice. “In what moment is the public going to help?” Though the number of cases reported per day in Honduras has fallen sharply from the epidemic’s peak in July, Dr. Nolasco frets that scenes like this are part of the reason there may be a resurgence of cases in the new year.  “I don’t even know what’s coming in January, February, March,” she said, sounding exhausted. “It could get worse.”']","Rising temperatures are increasing the range of disease-bearing mosquitoes globally. But in Honduras, the effects are compounded by government dysfunction and criminal gangs."
"Norwegian Spy Jailed by Russia Is Free. He’s Angry, Too, but Not at Moscow.",2019-12-28,By Anton Troianovski,"['KIRKENES, Norway — Frode Berg says he never meant to be a spy. Mr. Berg, a silver-haired Norwegian pensioner known by his neighbors to have a soft spot for neighboring Russia, was 60 when an acquaintance in his Arctic hometown recruited him in 2015 to work for Norway’s military intelligence. Over the next two years, on five trips across the border, Mr. Berg acted as a courier — mailing relatively small sums of cash and encrypted memory cards to a woman in Moscow he knew nothing about. Then, one December morning in 2017 when he was in Moscow, Russian agents swept him up, bundled him into a brown Volkswagen van and sped him to the old K.G.B. headquarters. He spent the next two years in prison where, by his own account, he was treated fairly well. Now, finally free, Mr. Berg is angry — but not at Russia. “I was under pressure from the military intelligence service in Norway,” Mr. Berg, a former inspector along the Norwegian border with Russia, said in an interview after his release in a prisoner swap in November. “I trusted them that they will not send me to something dangerous in Russia. And they did.” Mr. Berg was, by all appearances, a small-time player in a botched intelligence operation. But his tale embodies the tensions emerging as Western countries intensify their hunt for the Kremlin’s secrets.  His arrest has also shaken his hometown, Kirkenes, a prim, fjord-side community in Norway’s far north that has close economic ties with Russia. People in this Arctic seaport just west of the Russian frontier are upset that Mr. Berg, who spent decades promoting cross-border cooperation, had breached the trust those efforts were meant to build. And they are furious that Norway — a NATO ally that abuts Russia in the strategically important Arctic region — has solicited intelligence help from its own citizens who frequently cross the border for business and cultural exchanges. To NATO, Kirkenes is on the vanguard of East-West confrontation because it is just across the border from the Kola Peninsula, home to Russia’s powerful Northern Fleet and much of the country’s nuclear arsenal. But to many who live in this isolated region, Russia is primarily a partner, driving their economy thanks to fishermen docking at their port and Russians making day trips to buy diapers and other Western goods.  “We want to promote this region as a region of cooperation, bringing down walls and building bridges,” said Marit Jacobsen, deputy head of the Norwegian Barents Secretariat, which funds cooperation projects with Russia. “We can handle one Frode Berg, but we cannot handle that many.” During the Cold War, Mr. Berg was stationed as a soldier in Kirkenes, now a town of about 3,500 people. Sometimes he found himself a few feet from Soviet soldiers on patrol, but he never made eye contact.  He later became a border inspector and, after communism collapsed, he and his colleagues gave boots, uniforms and food to their suddenly impoverished Russian counterparts.  Fascinated by Norway’s newly accessible neighbor, Mr. Berg later traveled frequently to Russia and worked with a Kirkenes cross-border arts organization, Pikene pa Broen, to help coordinate its annual international festival.  Then, in 2015, a local politician asked for a favor, Mr. Berg recalls: Would he mind mailing 3,000 euros in cash, about $3,300, to an address in Moscow on his next trip to Russia? It was an open secret, known to Mr. Berg, that this politician worked for Norway’s military intelligence agency. Mr. Berg trusted him, so he agreed without asking questions. “What is this about, really?” Mr. Berg says he later asked another intelligence officer, in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, who gave him digital memory cards and more cash to mail. “‘It’s very important that you can do this for me, Frode,’” the man in Oslo responded, according to Mr. Berg. “You’re a good Norwegian, and helping us.” Mr. Berg said he tried to quit in spring 2017. But tantalized by an expenses-paid trip to glittering Moscow at Christmastime, he agreed to one last mission. On Dec. 5, 2017, men in civilian clothes swept up Mr. Berg as he walked out of the ritzy Metropol Hotel and brought him to the offices of Russia’s spy agency — the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B. In a wood-paneled basement conference room, the officers showed a picture of a Norwegian intelligence official who they said was in charge of Mr. Berg’s operation. Mr. Berg said, yes, he knew him. They offered more names of intelligence officials he had been in contact with, and Mr. Berg said, yes, he knew them all. “‘We respect you, but we had to arrest you,’” one of the officers said, according to Mr. Berg. “‘We know everything.’” After the arrest, Mr. Berg’s friends in Kirkenes were convinced he was an innocent man who had been framed by Russia or was the victim of a terrible mistake.  But realizing that his sole chance of freedom was a speedy conviction and a spy swap, Mr. Berg admitted a few months later, through his lawyers, that he had worked as a courier — shocking his supporters who thought he was innocent and had hung a “Help Frode Come Home!” banner in the Kirkenes main square. “When you are a border citizen, you have to act like a border citizen,” said one of those supporters, the Kirkenes pastor Torbjorn Brox Webber. That means “not to get so involved with the intelligence service.” Mr. Berg said he was treated much better than other inmates at Moscow’s Lefortovo Prison, where he spent his two years behind bars. He watched TV, became a fan of the Russian pop star Olga Buzova and read up on the crimes his fellow prisoners were accused of in the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets, delivered daily to his cell. He counted 14 meetings with counterintelligence officers from the F.S.B. When they asked if he wanted anything, Mr. Berg said McDonald’s. So they started bringing a McChicken sandwich, fries and Coke Zero. Afterward, he said, the officers sometimes poured him a shot of cognac. Rather than pressing him for information, they seemed intent on showing off how much they knew, he said. They even identified the nondescript building in Kirkenes where Norway’s military intelligence held secret meetings. At one point, the conversation got so friendly, Mr. Berg recalled, that one officer told him: “‘Frode, don’t forget. I’m the investigator and you’re sitting in prison. You’re a spy.’” In trying to secure Mr. Berg’s release, Norway’s government faced an obstacle: Its prisons had no Russian spies to trade. Eventually, its NATO ally Lithuania, which was holding two Russians on espionage convictions, agreed to a three-way deal. On the way to the airport in Moscow, the four-car F.S.B. convoy carrying Mr. Berg and the two Lithuanian prisoners to freedom made a stop. It was at a McDonald’s. Back on home soil in November, Mr. Berg told Norwegian journalists that the F.S.B. had named others who, unknown to him, had supposedly worked for Norwegian intelligence.  The comment jolted Rune Rafaelsen, the mayor of Kirkenes: “I thought, ‘Who is that?’” Mr. Rafaelsen said he has “chosen not to look behind my shoulder” and question whether his neighbors are spies. Others are less certain.  Distrust, they said, has become unavoidable in the wake of the Berg case, especially as rumors fly about more undercover officers and other recruitment attempts.  “Let them recruit their people elsewhere,” said Willy Bangsund, a wrestling coach who said he had turned down cooperation requests from Norwegian intelligence.  Norwegian intelligence agents, Mr. Bangsund and others said, had become overzealous in trying to recruit locals to help them gain information about Russia, putting at risk their efforts to deepen economic and cultural ties with their neighbor to the east.  As a result, few in Kirkenes praised Mr. Berg for undertaking a high-risk mission in the name of national security. Rather, they said, he should have understood what he was getting into, and that fellow Norwegians may face greater suspicion when they travel to Russia as a result. “There was no pistol at his head,” Mr. Rafaelsen said, referring to Mr. Berg’s decision to cooperate with Norwegian intelligence. “I don’t think the pressure was so hard that he couldn’t have said no.” A parliamentary committee is investigating possible wrongdoing in Mr. Berg’s case, though the government hasn’t publicly confirmed links between him and the military intelligence service. Norway’s Defense Ministry, which oversees the service, declined interview requests, as did the prime minister’s office. “For 70 years Norway, has pursued a balanced, pragmatic and transparent approach of deterrence and dialogue toward Russia,” the state secretary of defense, Tone Skogen, said in a statement. Mr. Berg says he takes no pride in his clandestine missions and two years in prison in the service of his country.  “It’s not for me to be a spion,” Mr. Berg said, using the Norwegian, and Russian, word for spy. “A hero? I don’t feel like this.”']","Frode Berg, a trusting pensioner, willingly worked for Norwegian intelligence. Then, he says, they hung him out to dry."
Kazakhstan Plane Crash Kills at Least 12 People,2019-12-27,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — A passenger jet carrying 98 people crashed into a building shortly after takeoff from Almaty International Airport in Kazakhstan on Friday morning, killing at least 12 people and injuring scores more. The crash of the Bek Air plane was the latest aviation tragedy to befall a former Soviet republic, a region plagued by a still-checkered safety record even as passenger numbers increase with the proliferation of low-cost carriers like Bek, a small Kazakh airline.  The accident heightened fears about air travel in Kazakhstan and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a group that includes most of the former Soviet Union — and that ranks worst in the world for its incidence of major accidents, according to the International Air Transport Association.  In Russia, another member of the C.I.S., the crash renewed talk about the country’s own aviation problems. The Bek Air accident follows a fiery emergency landing by an Aeroflot plane in Moscow in May, killing 41 people, and a Saratov Airlines crash outside Moscow last year that killed all 71 people aboard. In Almaty, most of the passengers survived, the Kazakh authorities said. There were conflicting reports on the total number of people on board, but the Health Ministry, in a statement, eventually fixed the numbers at 93 passengers and five crew members. Photographs carried by Kazakh news outlets showed the fuselage of the passenger jet ripped to pieces in the snow amid the rubble of a building. Rescue workers combed the wreckage. In one photo, emergency workers were seen picking through the debris — a red suitcase, a building’s window frame and pieces of the aircraft. At 7:22 a.m., the plane, a Dutch-made Fokker 100, bound for Nur-Sultan, the Kazakh capital, lost altitude and crashed into a two-story building in a residential area near the airport, officials said.  Eight people were confirmed dead at the scene, two more while being treated at the airport and another two after being taken to a hospital, officials said. Ten people were reported hospitalized in critical condition. A surviving passenger, Aslan Nazaraliyev, 34, said he was watching the TV show “Billions” in an aisle seat in row 15 when the plane started “rocking like a boat” as it gained altitude after takeoff. Then, he said, it started shaking violently and people on board started to panic, even as the craft continued to climb. About a minute later, “the flight got out of control,” like a car skidding on ice, Mr. Nazaraliyev, a businessman whose company makes professional cleaning supplies, said in a phone interview. The plane started to fall at an angle before it made impact some 20 seconds later, he said, slamming into a two-story building, pieces of which rained down to the ground. A man and woman to his right opened the emergency exit and clambered out, slipping and falling on the plane’s icy wing. Guided by their smartphone flashlights and by people’s moans, Mr. Nazaraliyev and others dragged the injured people away from the plane for fear it would catch fire. “Where is the ambulance?” a woman can be heard saying on a video from the scene circulated by the Kazakh news media. “People are asking for an ambulance and it’s not arriving.” In another video, apparently filmed about 20 minutes after the crash, people can be heard moaning and screaming. No emergency workers can be seen. “We’re taking them out on our own and helping on our own,” a man says.  Among the dead, Interfax reported, were the plane’s 38-year-old captain, Marat Muratbayev; an editor for a Kazakh news outlet, Dana Kruglova, who was 35; and a prominent Kazakh major general, Rustem Kaydarov, 79. Mr. Nazaraliyev said he was unharmed in the crash. After rescue workers arrived, he got a ride back to the same airport from which he had just departed and then took a cab home. He said that some survivors asked if they would get their tickets refunded and when they would get their luggage back. “I said, ‘Guys, you should be happy you’re alive,’” Mr. Nazaraliyev recalled. Almaty, in southeastern Kazakhstan near the mountainous border with Kyrgyzstan, is the Central Asian country’s biggest city.  The Kazakh authorities have halted flights of the Fokker 100, a twin-engine model built in the 1980s and ’90s, news agencies reported, citing the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development.  The authorities were investigating pilot error or technical problems as possible causes of the crash, Deputy Prime Minister Roman Sklyar said. The plane’s tail twice touched the runway as it was taking off, Mr. Sklyar said, according to Russia’s Tass state news agency. “We don’t know where the Fokker 100 is,” an air traffic controller told another airliner after the Bek Air flight took off, according to a recording published by Kazakh news outlets.  Bek Air, which was Kazakhstan’s first low-cost airline, operated seven Fokker 100 jets and flies to 12 Kazakh destinations as well as Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia. A brief statement from the airline offered condolences and warned Kazakhs about the risk of fraudsters taking advantage of the tragedy. The accident is the second major deadly commercial aviation accident in the former Soviet Union this year, after the Aeroflot accident  in Moscow.  The crashes highlighted a history of problems in regional air travel as documented by the International Air Transport Association. In 2018, the C.I.S. region saw 1.19 aircraft losses per one million departures, compared to zero in Europe, Africa, and North America and 0.32 in the Asia-Pacific region. From 2013 to 2017, the C.I.S. ranked second worst, just ahead of Africa. A mass-market Russian tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, published an interview with an airline safety expert, Valery Shelkovnikov, who said Russian aviation employees shied away from reporting problems. “People are still afraid of everything,” Mr. Shelkovnikov said. “What if the bosses find out?” The last major commercial airline crash in Kazakhstan, which has a relatively small airline market, was in 2013, when a SCAT Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 regional jet went down outside Almaty, killing all 21 on board.  Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, declared Saturday a national day of mourning and ordered all entertainment events to be canceled across the country. In an emergency meeting at his residence, Mr. Tokayev called for checks on all airlines and air travel infrastructure in the country and directed the authorities to examine the legality of constructing buildings in the immediate vicinity of the Almaty airport. “All the guilty will be punished severely in accordance with the law,” Mr. Tokayev said on Twitter. Production on the Fokker 100 ceased in 1997, after the plane’s Dutch manufacturer went into bankruptcy a year earlier. Though many airlines have retired the aircraft, more than 100 are still active, mostly in Australia and Iran, and a well-maintained airliner can remain in service for more than 30 years; the plane involved in Friday’s crash was nearly 24 years old. The plane is almost 117 feet long and can carry up to 109 passengers.  In July this year, a Fokker 100 flying for Virgin Australia suffered engine failure after taking off from an airport in Western Australia. Crew members tried to restart the left engine after it began to fail as the aircraft was climbing, said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is investigating the incident. They could not restart the engine, but were able to fly to their destination 260 miles away. The plane landed safely with no injuries reported. A report on the investigation is expected in the first few months of the new year. And last month, a Fokker 100 flying for Alliance Airlines lost speed preparing to land at Rockhampton Airport in the Australian state of Queensland, the safety bureau said.

Somali Terror Group Al Shabab Remains Resilient Despite Setbacks,2019-12-29,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — The terror group Al Shabab, suspected in the weekend attack that killed 79 people in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, has proved resilient in recent years even as it lost territory, suffered high-level defections and faced increasing airstrikes by the United States. Almost a decade since African peacekeeping forces kicked the Al Qaeda-linked group out of Mogadishu, it has become deft in handling its operations, versatile in using guerrilla tactics and prolific in manufacturing bombs.  Over the past few years, the Shabab killed hundreds of people in attacks at home and on neighboring Kenya, assaulted an American military base outside Mogadishu and overran military bases of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.  To finance itself, the militants have set up an extensive racketeering system that levies fees on sales of agricultural produce in southern and central Somalia — areas that are the stronghold of the group. They also tax imports into the Mogadishu port, according to the United Nations.  The Shabab have also been able to infiltrate federal institutions — they claimed to have recruited a government employee to kill Mogadishu’s mayor, Abdirahman Omar Osman, in July. And the group’s growing assertiveness was in evidence when it declared war last year on pro-Islamic State groups in Somalia in a fight over territory. “Al Shabab is still strong and stable,” said Stig Jarle Hansen, the author of “Horn, Sahel and Rift: Fault-lines of the African Jihad.” The ongoing threat it poses, he said, goes to show that the  “government still has a lot of work to do when it comes to providing safety and security for its ordinary citizens.” The government said at least 79 people were killed and 149 injured when a truck bomb detonated at a busy intersection on Saturday — the deadliest attack in the country in more two years. While no group has taken responsibility yet, suspicion immediately fell on the Shabab, which remains a serious threat to peace and stability in Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa region.   The magnitude of the attack was the latest reminder of the deteriorating security situation in Somalia — one of the world’s most fragile states — even as the nation takes piecemeal efforts toward recovery from a decades-long civil war.  The weak government is afflicted by internal dysfunction and corruption and oversees an ineffective security force. Efforts to rebuild a functional security apparatus to face off against the Shabab have proved easier said than done.  The government has a number of external backers, including the African Union, the United Nations and the United States, which are helping it build a functional police force. In 2017, Turkey set up its largest overseas military base in Somalia in a bid to train and equip more than 10,000 Somali soldiers. But while these entities continue to support the Somali Army in the liberation of key towns from the militants, the Shabab sometimes retake those towns immediately afterward, because of the federal government’s inability to securely govern them.  On Sunday, the Pentagon’s Africa Command, which oversees military relations with African states, said in a statement that it conducted three airstrikes against Al Shabab, killing four militants. “The government has failed to become credible and legitimate in the eyes of the public,” said Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst. The country’s security services “are in complete disarray,” he added, undermining efforts to successfully hold off attacks. Somalia has also become a proxy battleground for Gulf powers looking to expand their economic and political influence in the Horn of Africa, with both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates accused of delivering military training to various regional security forces. But where the Somali government continues to seek external support, the Shabab has learned to be “self-reliant” and “operate on a shoestring budget,” Mr. Abdi said. “There must be foreign help, but it is very minimal and very negligible,” he said. And where they enlist support, it must be with making and securely posting some of its sophisticated propaganda online. In November, a group of United Nations experts said the Shabab’s use of improvised explosive devices to carry out attacks reached its “greatest extent in Somali history” last year thanks to growing bomb-making operations.  But Mr. Abdi said that nothing has boosted Al Shabab’s recent rise more than the stagnation of the government in Mogadishu. While the country has made tremendous political, social and economic progress since the federal government was established in 2012, it still faces poverty, high unemployment, and periodic natural disasters. Over the past year, a standoff between the central government and federal states over electoral processes has added to the threats to Somalia’s stability. Even in areas controlled by the government, the authorities struggle to provide basic services and overcome corruption and mismanagement of state institutions.  The Shabab, on the other hand, mediates to resolve day-to-day problems — especially land disputes —  even in areas it doesn’t control, Mr. Abdi said. “Al Shabab feeds on these weaknesses and grows in strength,” he said. Civilians are bearing the brunt of the growing bloodshed that has gripped major Somali towns and cities in recent years. Tired of the vicious cycle of violence and slow government response, citizens have started taking matters into their own hands during emergencies.  Following Saturday’s attack, a group of 19 young men and women crowded into a room in Mogadishu and came up with a grass-roots organization to track and identify dead or missing people, share the names and locations of those injured, appeal for global attention and seek financial support. During times of crises, the government’s response “is at best tepid and at worst inhumane,” said the group’s coordinator, Abdihakim Ainte. Within hours of their formation on Saturday evening, they raised $20,000 from people in three countries, Mr. Ainte said. On Sunday, as the group’s membership ballooned, they sent counselors to hospitals to support families and victims. “The idea is driven by self-reliance,” Mr. Ainte said. “This is a Somali tragedy and it should have a Somali response.” Among the victims were parents going to work, students heading to university, foreign engineers building roads, and shop owners. The attack resembled another in October 2017 when a double truck bombing detonated at a busy crossroads in Mogadishu and killed nearly 600 people.  While the Shabab didn’t take responsibility, it was similar to others carried out by the group that involved packing a vehicle with explosives to breach the perimeter of a target followed by a direct assault by gunmen.  ']","The group suspected in a weekend attack that killed 79 people has lost territory, suffered defections and been targeted by increasing United States airstrikes. But it can still mount large attacks."
The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in January,2019-12-27,By Scott Tobias,"['Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for January, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. ‘The Post’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 Produced quickly in response to the escalating tensions between the press and the Trump administration, Steven Spielberg’s political thriller makes a strong case for the mainstream media as a bulwark of democracy in dark political times. “The Post” spells that thesis out a bit too explicitly at times, but when it focuses on the nuts and bolts of the Washington Post editor in chief Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) and his team publishing the Pentagon Papers despite White House objections, it belongs in the conversation with classics like “All the President’s Men.” Meryl Streep does standout work as Katharine Graham, the paper’s new publisher, who has to fend off the same D.C. elites she entertains at parties. ‘Game Night’ Starts streaming: Jan. 4 Rachel McAdams cuts loose in this hugely entertaining comedy about a competitive married couple (McAdams and Jason Bateman) whose regular game night among friends turns into a life-or-death situation. It begins innocently enough with her megasuccessful brother-in-law (Kyle Chandler) inviting the group over for an interactive role-playing mystery game, but when assailants break into the house and take him away, nobody realizes he’s been abducted for real. “Game Night” keeps them in the dark for a while, leading to one hilarious bit in which McAdams re-enacts a scene from “Pulp Fiction,” and it stays funny when they’re thrust into a chaotic nocturnal adventure. ‘Captain America: The First Avenger’ Starts streaming: Jan. 25 One criticism of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies is that all of them look the same, forced to conform to a common template so the various superheroes can come together in crossovers and team-ups. “Captain America: The First Avenger” is one of the few exceptions, thanks to its director, Joe Johnston, who has always been a high-quality Steven Spielberg mimic (he directed “Jurassic Park III”) and who gives the World War II section of the film a distinct visual panache. Chris Evans enters the MCU as Steve Rogers, an eager World War II recruit who agrees to take part in a “super-soldier” experiment if it can help the war effort. The experiment works all too well. ‘Frères Ennemis’ Starts streaming: Jan. 29 Picked up by Netflix after drawing strong reviews at the Venice Film Festival in September, David Oelhoffen’s French crime drama, translated as “Close Enemies,” details the divergent paths of two men who grew up friends in a rough Paris banlieue — one has become a narcotics officer, the other part of a drug syndicate. The twist in “Frères Ennemis” is that the surrogate families that surround these men are not what one might assume: The drug dealer (Matthias Schoenaerts) is part of a warm and loyal clan while the officer (Reda Kateb) lives out his more respectable life in relative isolation. Their paths intersect in complex and explosive ways. ‘Uncut Gems’ Starts streaming: Jan. 31 In Josh and Benny Safdie’s bleeding ulcer of a thriller, Adam Sandler stars as a Diamond District store owner whose gambling addiction has put him in mortal danger with the criminal element. His chances of betting his way out of hock are remote, but he sees an opportunity to climb out of debt when he purchases an uncut opal from an Ethiopian mine with the hope of auctioning it off for hundreds of thousands of dollars. A visit from the former Boston Celtics center Kevin Garnett (playing himself, convincingly) alters his plans, as do huge bets placed with a bookie (Mike Francesa) and with the Mohegan Sun casino. The Safdies stage his wheeling and dealing with relentless pace and an acrid sense of humor. ‘Messiah’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 What if the Second Coming happened in our modern world? That’s the question asked by this sure-to-be-controversial series about a serene miracle worker (Mehdi Dehbi) who materializes in the Middle East and gathers a devoted following, but opinions vary on whether he’s a savior or a con artist. Michelle Monaghan stars as the C.I.A. officer assigned to the case, and the supporting cast is loaded with familiar faces like Jane Adams, Beau Bridges and Philip Baker Hall. Mark Burnett and Roma Downey are among the executive producers, and given their past sponsorship of faith-based projects like “The Bible” and “Son of God,” a Christian bent seems likely. ‘Spinning Out’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 Older generations might remember the 1978 sports drama “Ice Castles,” about a figure skater who is blinded in a terrible accident and miraculously returns to the sport with a partner/love interest. This new series looks like a similar story, only a much hipper, more hard-edge version, with Kaya Scodelario starring as an Olympic-level talent who abruptly exits the competition track after a head injury, but makes a comeback alongside a bad-boy pairs skater (Evan Roderick). The heightened theatrics of the trailer make “Spinning Out” look like a camp thriller, with “Mad Men” ice queen January Jones as Scodelario’s disapproving mother and a role for the real-life skater Johnny Weir. ‘The Circle’ Starts streaming: Jan. 1 It wasn’t long ago that Dave Eggers wrote a book called “The Circle” that warned of the dark side of Silicon Valley, focusing on a cultish invasiveness of a Google-like corporate campus. It was even less long ago that Eggers’s book was turned into a disastrous flop with Tom Hanks and Emma Watson. And now the title has been claimed, without a hint of self-awareness, by this reality competition series, which cheerfully accepts an online discourse where identity and accountability are totally up for grabs. “The Circle” mixes the surveillance-cam aesthetics of “Big Brother” with the sinister twists of “Catfish,” with contestants who all live in the same apartment building but communicate with one another only through an app. The last one not to get “blocked” wins. ‘Cheer’ Starts streaming: Jan. 8 Fans of the addictive junior-college football series “Last Chance U” can expect a similar approach to this six-episode documentary series from the same creator, Greg Whiteley, about the unusually dominant competitive cheerleading squad at Navarro College in Corsicana, Tex. The Navarro cheerleaders have won 14 national championships since 2000, so expectations are high that they will win another in the year “Cheer” follows them around, but the pressure to win, along with injuries and other setbacks, makes it a stressful run. As with “Last Chance U,” Whiteley tries to bear down on the particulars of the sport while getting to know these athletes off the field, too. ‘AJ and the Queen’ Starts streaming: Jan. 10 Despite some bit appearances in movies and fictional shows over the years, the drag queen icon RuPaul is best known for appearing on television shows like the reality-TV hit “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” The new series “AJ and the Queen,” which he conceived with the frequent “Sex and the City” writer/director Michael Patrick King, gives him a chance to play off his irreverent persona while honing his dramatic chops. He stars here as Ruby Red, a cash-poor drag queen who travels across the country in a beat-up R.V., accompanied by  an 11-year-old orphan stowaway (Izzy G.). The pair get more than a few looks as they make their way through the heartland. ‘Giri/Haji’ Starts streaming: Jan. 10 After debuting to strong reviews on the BBC, this eight-part cross-cultural British mini-series comes to Netflix to fill a seemingly endless appetite for crime stories among subscribers. Set between London and Tokyo, “Giri/Haji” (translated as Duty/Shame) starts with a Japanese detective (Takehiro Hira) who travels to London to search for his missing brother, who’s a member of the Yakuza. Once he arrives in the U.K., he gets help from a detective constable (Kelly Macdonald) and a half-Japanese prostitute (Will Sharpe), but these unlikely allies face a much thicker plot than they might have imagined. ‘Medical Police’ Starts streaming: Jan. 10 The creators of “Childrens Hospital” parody international espionage thrillers with this extended goof about doctors-turned-government agents who try to find the source of a virus that threatens to wipe out civilization. Erinn Hayes and Rob Huebel star as American physicians in a São Paulo hospital who discover the virus and get recruited by a secret spy organization to find the cure while unmasking the conspiracy responsible. Other “Childrens Hospital” regulars are cast here, too — including Rob Corddry, Malin Åkerman, Ken Marino and Lake Bell — so it’s reasonable to expect the tongue-in-cheek absurdity of that show to carry over into this one. ‘Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts’ Starts streaming: Jan. 14 Though heavily influenced by the sharp angles, vibrant colors and exaggerated character design of Japanese animation, “Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts” was created through DreamWorks by one of its artisans, Radford Sechrist, and includes Sterling K. Brown, Dan Stevens, Joan Jett, John Hodgman and RZA among its eclectic voice talents. Karen Fukuhara voices Kipo, a young girl who is among the human survivors of an apocalyptic event that has turned other living things into enormous and intelligent creatures, pushing people far down the evolutionary chain. She and a handful of humans and friendly surface-dwellers band together to find her father and others missing from her underground city. ‘Next in Fashion’ Starts streaming: Jan. 29 The venerable “Project Runway” is currently on its 18th season and counting, but without Heidi Klum as host and Tim Gunn as mentor, there must be enough blood in the water for another fashion competition show to seize the spotlight. The “Queer Eye” favorite Tan France and the designer/model Alexa Chung are co-hosting “Next in Fashion,” which puts 18 designers through various challenges to determine a winner, but the tight 10-episode run will ramp up the hourly casualties. The winner gets $250,000 and a collection showcased by the retailer Net-a-Porter, which is a larger-than-usual carrot at the end of the stick. ‘The Stranger’ Starts streaming: Jan. 30 The team behind the Netflix crime drama “Safe” from 2018 — the novelist Harlan Coben and Red Production Company — returns with an eight-episode adaptation of Coben’s novel “The Stranger.” Richard Armitage stars as a normal guy with a healthy marriage and two sons whose life turns to shambles when a stranger sits next to him at a bar and tells him a secret that sets him on a destabilizing course. How this stranger’s words could upend the lives of anyone who hears them is a mystery the series will explore, leading its hero to a sinister conspiracy that threatens harm to himself and others. ‘Bojack Horseman Season 6 (Part B)’ Starts streaming: Jan. 31 After a three-month breather, “Bojack Horseman” returns with the last eight episodes of its six-season run, which has evolved from an offbeat comedy about a has-been equine entertainer (voiced by Will Arnett) to a character study that’s chased its laughs with serious insight into addiction, depression and various existential crises. The first part of season six caught Bojack at a low point, struggling to clean himself up after getting hooked on painkillers and alcohol, and assaulting a co-star. The second part will continue his road to recovery, but characters and incidents from his past are sure to create a few speed bumps. The miracle of the show is how much it incorporates these difficult life events without losing its sense of humor. Also of interest: “American Graffiti” (Jan. 1), “Definitely, Maybe” (Jan. 1), “Sex, Explained: Limited Series” (Jan. 2), “Thieves of the Wood” (Jan. 2), “Grace and Frankie: Season 6” (Jan. 15), “Sex Education: Season 2” (Jan. 17), “Tyler Perry’s A Fall From Grace” (Jan. 17), “The Queen” (Jan. 23), “The Ranch: The Final Season” (Jan. 24), “I Am a Killer: Season 2” (Jan. 31).']","This month’s new additions include “The Post” with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks; “Uncut Gems,” starring Adam Sandler; and “AJ and the Queen,” featuring RuPaul."
"Tourists Drowned at Pool in Spain Because They Couldn’t Swim, Police Say",2019-12-27,By Mark A. Walsh,"['LONDON — The deaths of a father and two children who drowned in a swimming pool at a resort in southern Spain this week were “a tragic accident” that came about because none of the victims knew how to swim, the authorities said on Friday, in a conclusion that was quickly challenged by a family member. The victims, including a 9-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, were tourists on a family vacation at a resort in Mijas, in the Costa del Sol.  The family’s three children, including the two who died and a 14-year-old girl, had been bathing in the shallow end of a pool at about 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday while their parents sunbathed, according to a statement by the Civil Guard, a Spanish police force.  The 9-year-old at some point moved into deeper water and could not get out. Her brother, the 16-year-old, tried to help but then found himself also in trouble, prompting the father to jump in, the statement said. None of the three could swim, the police said. A church in Britain, the Redeemed Christian Church of God, said in a statement that the victims included a pastor, Gabriel Diya, 52, who had worked at Open Heavens, a branch of the organization in Charlton, southeastern London, along with one of his daughters, Comfort Diya, and his son, Praise-Emmanuel Diya.  Mr. Diya’s wife, Olubunmi, said in a statement Friday that all three knew how to swim. She said that the children had used steps to enter the pool, “but found themselves dragged into the middle, which was deeper and called for help when they could not get out.” “I believe something was wrong with the pool that must have made swimming difficult for them at that point in time,” she said. “By the time assistance came, the three of them were under the water.” She added that investigations by the Spanish police were “still ongoing.” The father and daughter were British citizens and the teenage son was American, the authorities said. The five members of the family were said to have arrived at the resort, the Club La Costa World, on Sunday. “He was a loving husband and devoted father,” the statement from the church said. “He was also a humble, friendly and committed pastor and Christian leader.” Jorge Martín, a spokesman for the civil guard in Spain, said by telephone on Friday that the water was about six and a half feet deep at the pool’s deepest point.  An initial report that a resort employee who entered the pool during the episode had also struggled to get out suggested that there might have been a problem with the pool’s filtration or drainage systems, Mr. Martín said. That led to suspicions that a malfunction might have sucked the three victims underwater, but the police statement said that investigators had checked the equipment at the resort and found no problems.  Mr. Martín said the employee had clarified that he had had trouble exiting the pool because he was trying to retrieve the bodies. Samples of the water were also taken and were being analyzed, the statement said, but autopsies found no evidence of chemical intoxication and ruled the cause of deaths as drowning. The civil guard said that the deaths were “a tragic accident caused by the victims’ lack of expertise in swimming when they found themselves in a deep area of the pool where they could not put their feet down.” The operator of the resort, CLC World Resorts and Hotels, said that the company was providing care and support to the family and other guests. The authorities “have carried out a full investigation and gave formal permissions to reopen the pool as they found no concerns relating to the pool or procedures in place,” the company said in a statement. Experts warn that even if children are confident in the water, vigilance is needed whenever they go swimming. For those who cannot swim competently, arm’s-length supervision is recommended. Nicole Hughes, a teacher in Tennessee, has been an advocate for legislation to provide more barriers around pools since her 3-year-old son, Levi, drowned while on vacation in Alabama in 2018. She told The New York Times in July that it was frighteningly simple for accidents to happen. “We took water safety very seriously — if you’d given me a list of 1,000 reasons one of my kids would die, drowning would have been the 1,000th,” Ms. Hughes said at the time. The numbers back up the warnings. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 people die in the United States by accidental drowning every day, two of them children under 14.']","A father and two children, ages 9 and 16, who died in a pool at a resort on the Costa del Sol, found themselves in deep water and unable to get out, the authorities said."
Netanyahu Won Over His Party. Can He Win Over Israel?,2019-12-27,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — After failing to form a government twice in two tries, then being hit with a bribery charge, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s long rule over Israel appeared set to expire. But in his first real test since his indictment last month in three corruption cases, Mr. Netanyahu crushed a lone rival Thursday for the leadership of his conservative Likud party and, like a political phoenix, rose to fight another day. “I received a renewed and huge mandate from the Likud yesterday,” he said in a victory speech on Friday, hours after the final tally was in. “The future is in our hands.” With his landslide victory in the Likud party primary election, Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and a famed political survivor, has reasserted his grip over the party in spite of his legal troubles, fired up his base and reinvigorated his campaign ahead of the next general election in early March. The election will be the third in a year, an unprecedented situation as a deeply polarized Israel struggles to form a government after inconclusive elections in April and September. The questions many Israelis were asking Friday were whether the die-hard Netanyahu fans who came out to vote for him on a wet, blustery day reflect wider support on the Israeli right, whether Mr. Netanyahu can maintain his fresh momentum for another two months, and whether anything could jolt a hung electorate out of its political logjam. “The primary injected enthusiasm and got the Likud machine working,” said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “But can that buzz be maintained over months? I’m not sure.” Mr. Netanyahu trounced his party rival, Gideon Saar, winning 72.5 percent of the vote. Still, just under half the 116,000 eligible dues-paying Likud members cast ballots, meaning that about 41,000 Netanyahu adherents — a tiny fraction of the total Israeli electorate of about 6.4 million voters — may have locked the country into another round of political paralysis. The previous two elections ended in a draw between Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing-religious coalition and the center-left bloc led by Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief, with neither able to form a majority coalition. Recent polls before the Likud primary showed Mr. Netanyahu’s support softening after his indictment but not enough to change the unforgiving math that has paralyzed the Israeli government for the past year. Moderate conservatives concerned about upholding the rule of law may find it difficult to vote for Mr. Netanyahu, Ms. Talshir said, noting that in more educated, well-heeled districts like north Tel Aviv,  Mr. Saar made a strong showing. The one likely outcome of Mr. Netanyahu’s new lease on political life is that the March 2 election will again be ugly and divisive, analysts said. It will pit the “Only Bibi” camp of supporters, who lovingly call Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname, attack the law enforcement authorities and try to delegitimize any opposition, against the other Israel that cannot accept the idea of a prime minister facing prosecution for serious crimes. Mr. Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White party, made it clear on Friday that he will once again run as the “not Bibi” candidate. “It appears that the defendant Netanyahu, who is leading the state of Israel down a path of corruption, will continue to lead Likud,” Mr. Gantz said in response to the primary results. “These elections demand that we place a mirror in front of the ‘Netanyahu party’ and make the choice for unity, dignity and internal reconciliation,” he added. But with the same protagonists running again on the same issues, and with recent polls showing a similar deadlock, there is little expectation of a fundamental shake-up by the March election. “The people who don’t like Netanyahu still won’t like him,” said Israel Bachar, a strategist for the Blue and White campaign, dismissing any notion that the primary result could have a wider impact. “It won’t change the polling data.” What the primary did do is remove any doubt about Mr. Netanyahu’s hold over his party and his ministers, Mr. Bachar said, “and that’s a good change for him.” While Mr. Netanyahu focuses on his legal issues, he added, Mr. Gantz will focus on values. Mr. Netanyahu is accused of trading official favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media moguls for illicit gifts of cigars, champagne and jewelry, as well as positive news coverage. He has denied any wrongdoing, casting himself as the victim of a witch hunt by a left-wing elite that he says dominates the news media and has pressed the law enforcement authorities to pursue criminal investigations against him. For his loyalists, the primary triumph clears a possible path ahead for Mr. Netanyahu. Miki Zohar, Likud’s chief whip in Parliament, said on television that the result is basically telling Mr. Netanyahu that his Likud voters want him to request parliamentary immunity from prosecution. Mr. Netanyahu has a few days left before the deadline for submitting such a request, though it would likely only be voted on if and when a new government is formed after the election. Approval would depend on Mr. Netanyahu’s being able to muster a majority of 61 in the 120-seat Parliament. That will mean getting out every last Likud and right-wing voter. In Jerusalem’s bustling Mahane Yehuda market, an old Likud bastion, some of the vendors reverently display fading portraits of Likud’s founder, Menachem Begin, a stickler for the rule of law, in their shops. One of them, Avraham Levy, 69, who voted for Mr. Netanyahu in the primary, said it was “not easy to find someone like him in our generation” as he sold fruit on Friday. He dismissed the charges against Mr. Netanyahu, saying, “It’s not bribery in my eyes so long as he didn’t take money.” Crediting the prime minister with the country’s strong economy and security, he said, “You don’t exchange a horse for a donkey. We have a good horse.” “Of course I’m a Likudnik,” exclaimed Shmuel Rosemarine, 30, who was working at his family’s dried fruit and nuts store. “Is there anything else? I’m for Bibi, and only Bibi. Nobody can replace him.” Yossi Verter, a political columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, cautioned that the love poured on Mr. Netanyahu by his party faithful may have no bearing at all on the March election. He cited the 1999 Likud primary, which Mr. Netanyahu won by an even greater margin before going on to a stinging defeat in the general election. “The only relevant conclusion today,” Mr. Verter wrote on Friday, “is that what happens in Likud stays in Likud.” ']","Handing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a victory in a Likud leadership primary, a tiny fraction of voters may have prolonged Israel’s political deadlock.

"An Old Menstruation Taboo Killed Her. This Time, a Man Went to Jail.",2019-12-27,By Bhadra Sharma and Jeffrey Gettleman,"['KATHMANDU, Nepal — Every winter, in Nepal’s snow-covered hills, young women keep dying because of a deadly superstition.  The tradition here says that any woman who has her period must be banished outside, to a cowshed or makeshift bunker, no matter how cold or dangerous. This has been a ritual, believed to protect the purity of the village, for as long as anyone can remember.  But this winter, someone was finally arrested in such a death — a first in Nepal, according to law enforcement officials. The case has set off a national debate about women’s rights, tradition, law and punishment. The Nepali authorities have jailed the brother-in-law of a young woman who died in a shed this month in the remote Achham District, in the far west. Many Nepalis have been disturbed by her death, and one newspaper called the taboo — called chhaupadi (pronounced CHOW-pa-dee) — a “national shame.” Human rights activists have been pressing the authorities to enforce a law that went into effect last year that punishes family members who exile menstruating women from their own homes. Still, villagers continue to do it, and many residents in Achham are upset that someone was sent to jail.  “The police are just adding pain over pain,’’ said Krishna Budha, the chief of the village where the young woman died. “She had gone to the hut on her own, taking part of our culture.”  But Nepal’s highest authorities intervened, leading police officers to make the arrest. An investigation is underway.  In the past few weeks, villagers have been ordered to destroy dozens of chhaupadi huts, and Nepal’s home ministry has threatened to cut off government aid to families that do not comply with a law that bans the chhaupadi ritual. “The police did a good job this time,” said Pashupati Kunwar, a leading anti-chhaupadi activist. “This has sent a warning.”  In Nepali language, chhaupadi means someone who bears an impurity. Menstruating women are considered polluted, even toxic, and from the earliest age, people here are taught that any contact with a menstruating woman will bring bad luck. An oppressive tradition has evolved around this taboo, including the construction of a separate hut for menstruating women to retreat to at night and then sleep in. Some of the spaces are as tiny as a closet, walls made of mud or rock, basically menstruation foxholes. Each year, at least one woman, usually more, and often young, dies in such a tiny space from smoke inhalation, a snake bite or exposure to the cold. On Dec. 2, it happened again.  Shortly after sunrise, according to police officials, relatives of Parbati Budha, 21, sensed that something was wrong. Ms. Budha, who lived in a mountain village about a two-day drive from the capital, Kathmandu, was usually an early riser. She was known in the village as a determined worker who was quite bright; she graduated from 12th grade, unusual for girls from her village.  But on this morning, she did not emerge from her chhaupadi hut. When her sister-in-law and brother-in-law went to check on her, they found her on the shed’s floor, face down. Investigators said she had built a small fire inside the hut to keep warm during the freezing night, and died from inhaling too much smoke.  Ms. Budha had married about a year and a half ago and moved in with her husband’s family, as most women do in rural Nepal. Her husband worked in a sari showroom in neighboring India, and police officials say it was her husband’s brother, Chhatra Raut, 25, who pressured Ms. Budha to move out to the shed. (Some police officials said his name was Chhatra Rawat.) The news about Ms. Budha’s death quickly spread, dismaying human rights activists. The activists, including Ms. Kunwar, asked the local police to investigate, but the officers refused. The officers said that nobody in the village had complained about the young woman’s death and therefore there was no case.  But the activists kept up their pressure. And in Kathmandu, the tide has turned against chhaupadi, which has become something of an embarrassment to those trying to modernize Nepal.  After hearing what happened, Nepal’s attorney general, Agni Prasad Kharel, stepped in and ordered police officials to open an investigation, which quickly led them to the brother-in-law. The police arrested Mr. Raut and are holding him in a small jail. He faces a three-month sentence if found guilty of breaking the chhaupadi law, which makes it a crime to pressure a woman into seclusion.  Kedar Nath Sharma, a spokesman for the Home Ministry, said that any members of a family still practicing chhaupadi would not get the usual government allowances for elderly people and single women, concessional loans or recommendations for a school scholarship or government job.  He said the Nepali government was serious about ending this tradition once and for all.  “Women are dying in these huts,” he said. Bhadra Sharma reported from Kathmandu, and Jeffrey Gettleman from New Delhi.']","In a first for Nepal, the authorities have arrested a man who forced his sister-in-law to sleep out in a cold hut during her period."
Samoa Lifts State of Emergency After Deadly Measles Epidemic,2019-12-29,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Samoa announced on Saturday that it would reopen schools and end restrictions on public gatherings as it lifted a six-week state of emergency in the aftermath of a measles epidemic that left scores of children and babies dead.  Since September, more than 5,600 measles cases have been recorded in the Pacific island nation of about 200,000 people, the Health Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. At least 81 people have died, many of them younger than 5.  Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans, and no one in the close-knit country was left untouched.  The disease has resurfaced globally as vaccination rates have fallen, particularly in countries where poverty has left gaps in public health systems, experts said. In 2013, 90 percent of Samoan infants received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine by their first birthday. But by last year, the vaccination rate had dropped to 30 percent. The government said it had been complacent in routine immunizations. When two infants died after nurses inadvertently mixed the vaccine with muscle relaxant instead of sterile water, the country temporarily suspended the vaccination program.  That action, coupled with misinformation about the safety of the vaccine, left children under 5 particularly susceptible to the virus, according to the World Health Organization. When the virus arrived in Samoa from a person who had traveled from New Zealand, which is struggling with its own outbreak, the unvaccinated population was hit particularly hard. Under the state of emergency, schools were closed, children were banned from public gatherings and vaccinations were made compulsory. Early this month, the government shut down to focus on a nationwide vaccination campaign. Dozens of countries and international organizations sent health workers and supplies to help hospitals straining to keep up with the caseload. Health Ministry officials said that 95 percent of eligible people had received vaccinations, the threshold for “herd immunity,” which experts say is required to stop the spread of measles.']","The Pacific island nation will reopen schools after a measles outbreak killed 81 people, many of them children.

North Korea Leader Urges ‘Offensive Measures’ at Top Party Meeting,2019-12-29,By Choe Sang-Hun,"[""SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called for “offensive measures” to strengthen security at a meeting of senior officials, the state-run media reported on Monday, a day before a North Korean-imposed deadline for Washington to make concessions in stalled nuclear talks. Mr. Kim's comments came at a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party, which was convened over the weekend amid North Korean warnings that it was prepared to abandon diplomacy and resume nuclear and long-range missile tests. On Sunday, the second day of the meeting, Mr. Kim emphasized “the need to take positive and offensive measures for fully ensuring the sovereignty and security of the country as required by the present situation,” according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. To that end, Mr. Kim outlined “the duties of the fields of foreign affairs, munitions industry and armed forces,” the news agency reported. It provided no clarifications, including whether North Korea would officially lift its moratorium on testing intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons. Washington has dismissed the Dec. 31 deadline imposed by North Korea as “artificial,” and has urged Pyongyang to maintain a dialogue and not revert to the provocations that had raised fears of war on the Korean Peninsula two years ago. But Mr. Kim’s remarks about “offensive measures” indicated that North Korea was shifting to a harder line amid faltering diplomacy with Washington. President Trump, who has met with the North Korean leader at two summit meetings, has repeatedly cited his “good relationship” with him — at one point, he said he and Mr. Kim “fell in love.” He has frequently cited the North’s testing moratorium as evidence that his policy of engaging with North Korea is working.  North Korea has not been explicit about what might happen after the Dec. 31 deadline expires, but Mr. Kim has warned of finding a “new way” if Washington does not remove the economic sanctions that have crippled his country’s economy or if it tries to force an unpalatable denuclearization deal. The North Korean leader is set to deliver an annual speech on New Year’s Day, and analysts say he may officially reveal a major policy shift to be adopted at the party’s Central Committee. The committee is one of the highest decision-making bodies in North Korea, but it usually rubber-stamps any policy proposed by Mr. Kim, who rules with totalitarian control of the party, the military and all other levers of power. The party meeting was set to continue on Monday, and cover a variety of domestic and external issues, such as how to revive the country’s agriculture and other moribund industries, the news agency reported. Since assuming power in 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un has accelerated his country’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. North Korea has conducted four of its six underground nuclear tests since 2011, and it conducted three intercontinental ballistic missile tests in 2017. But at a Central Committee meeting in April 2018, Mr. Kim declared that with its nuclear force successfully built, North Korea would shift its focus to economic development and halt all nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. Two months later, he met Mr. Trump in Singapore for the first summit meeting between the sitting leaders of North Korea and the United States. Afterward, North Korea sounded victorious, and Mr. Kim promised to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Mr. Trump in turn promised the North security guarantees and “new” relations. But the mood soon soured as the governments began negotiating the details of what incentives Washington should offer in return for the North’s denuclearization and the timeline for doing so. The North demanded the immediate lifting of United Nations sanctions. Washington, however, insisted that North Korea first dismantle its nuclear program. A second meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, held in Vietnam in February, ended without an agreement, and North Korea later warned that Washington must offer a “new calculation” and create a breakthrough in the stalled negotiations by the end of the year. Turning up the pressure, the North has resumed weapons tests, launching 27 mostly short-range ballistic missiles and rockets since May and warning of more provocative tests to come. It warned this month that it was entirely up to the Trump administration “what Christmas gift it will select to get,” and conducted two ground tests at its missile engine test site to bolster what it called its “nuclear deterrent.”  But Christmas Day passed without any long-range missile or nuclear test by North Korea. In recent weeks, North Korean officials have suggested that they have all but concluded that there is little point in continuing negotiations with the politically vulnerable Mr. Trump. They have hardened their position, vowing to keep denuclearization off the table until Washington first revoked its entire “hostile policy,” including ending joint annual military exercises with South Korea. And they have also reverted to calling Mr. Trump insulting names, among them “dotard.”""]",Analysts warn that Kim Jong-un may end a moratorium on testing long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. 
How a Chase Bank Chairman Helped the Deposed Shah of Iran Enter the U.S.,2019-12-29,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['One late fall evening 40 years ago, a worn-out white Gulfstream II jet descended over Fort Lauderdale, Fla., carrying a regal but sickly passenger almost no one was expecting. Crowded aboard were a Republican political operative, a retinue of Iranian military officers, four smelly and hyperactive dogs and Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the newly deposed shah of Iran. Yet as the jet touched down, the only one waiting to receive the deposed monarch was a senior executive of Chase Manhattan Bank, which had not only lobbied the White House to admit the former shah but had arranged visas for his entourage, searched out private schools and mansions for his family and helped arrange the Gulfstream to deliver him. “The Eagle has landed,” Joseph V. Reed Jr., the chief of staff to the bank’s chairman, David Rockefeller, declared in a celebratory meeting at the bank the next morning. Less than two weeks later, on Nov. 4, 1979, vowing revenge for the admission of the shah to the United States, revolutionary Iranian students seized the American Embassy in Tehran and then held more than 50 Americans — and Washington — hostage for 444 days. The shah, Washington’s closest ally in the Persian Gulf, had fled Tehran in January 1979 in the face of a burgeoning uprising against his 38 years of iron-fisted rule. Liberals, leftists and religious conservatives were rallying against him. Strikes and demonstrations had shut down Tehran, and his security forces were losing control. The shah sought refuge in America. But President Jimmy Carter, hoping to forge ties to the new government rising out of the chaos and concerned about the security of the United States Embassy in Tehran, refused him entry for the first 10 months of his exile. Even then, the White House only begrudgingly let him in for medical treatment. Now, a newly disclosed secret history from the offices of Mr. Rockefeller shows in vivid detail how Chase Manhattan Bank and its well-connected chairman worked behind the scenes to persuade the Carter administration to admit the shah, one of the bank’s most profitable clients. For Mr. Carter, for the United States and for the Middle East it was an incendiary decision. The ensuing hostage crisis enabled Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to consolidate his theocratic rule, started a four-decade conflict between Washington and Tehran that is still roiling the region and helped Ronald Reagan take the White House. To American policymakers, Iran became a parable about the political perils in the fall of a friendly strongman. Although Mr. Carter complained publicly at the time about the pressure campaign, the full, behind-the-scenes story — laid out in the recently disclosed documents — has never been told.  Mr. Rockefeller’s team called the campaign Project Eagle, after the code name used for the shah. Exploiting clubby networks of power stretching deep into the White House, Mr. Rockefeller mobilized a phalanx of elder statesmen.  They included Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state and the chairman of a Chase advisory board; John J. McCloy, the former commissioner of occupied Germany after World War II and an adviser to eight presidents as well as a future Chase chairman; a Chase executive and former C.I.A. agent, Archibald B. Roosevelt Jr., whose cousin, the C.I.A. agent Kermit Roosevelt Jr., had orchestrated a 1953 coup to keep the shah in power; and Richard M. Helms, a former director of the C.I.A. and former ambassador to Iran.  Charles Francis, a veteran of corporate public affairs who worked for Chase at the time, brought the documents to the attention of The Times. “Today’s corporate campaigns are demolition derbies compared to this operation,” he said. “It was smooth, smooth, smooth and almost entirely invisible.” Records of Project Eagle were donated to Yale by Mr. Reed, the campaign’s director. But he deemed the material so potentially embarrassing to his patron that Mr. Reed, who died in 2016, stipulated that the records remain sealed until Mr. Rockefeller’s death. Mr. Rockefeller died in 2017 at the age of 101.  Some of the information may embarrass others as well. Hawkish critics have often faulted Mr. Carter as worrying too much about human rights and thus failing to prop up the shah.  But the papers reveal that the president’s special envoy to Iran had actually urged the country’s generals to use as much deadly force as needed to suppress the revolt, advising them about how to carry out a military takeover to keep the shah in power.  A spokeswoman for Mr. Carter did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Carter at the time of the crisis was not immediately available. After the hostages were taken, the Carter administration worked desperately to try to free the captives, and on April 24, 1980, authorized a rescue mission that collapsed in disaster: A helicopter crash in the desert killed eight service members, whose charred bodies were gleefully exhibited by Iranian officials. The hostage crisis doomed Mr. Carter’s presidency. And the team around Mr. Rockefeller, a lifelong Republican with a dim view of Mr. Carter’s dovish foreign policy, collaborated closely with the Reagan campaign in its efforts to pre-empt and discourage what it derisively labeled an “October surprise” — a pre-election release of the American hostages, the papers show.  The Chase team helped the Reagan campaign gather and spread rumors about possible payoffs to win the release, a propaganda effort that Carter administration officials have said impeded talks to free the captives.  “I had given my all” to thwarting any effort by the Carter officials “to pull off the long-suspected ‘October surprise,’” Mr. Reed wrote in a letter to his family after the election, apparently referring to the Chase effort to track and discourage a hostage release deal. He was later named Mr. Reagan’s ambassador to Morocco.  Mr. Rockefeller then personally lobbied the incoming administration to ensure that its Iran policies protected the bank’s financial interests.  The records indicate that Mr. Rockefeller hoped for the restoration of a version of the deposed government.  At the start of the Iranian upheaval, the papers show, Mr. Kissinger advised Mr. Rockefeller that the probable conclusion would be “a sort of Bonapartist counterrevolution that rallies the pro-Western elements together with what was left of the army.” Mr. Kissinger, in a recent email, acknowledged that the prediction “reflects my thinking at the time” but said “it was a judgment, not a policy proposal.”  But Mr. Rockefeller evidently continued to advocate for some form of restoration long after the shah fled Tehran. As late as December 1980, Mr. Rockefeller personally urged the incoming Reagan administration to encourage a counterrevolution by stopping “rug merchant type bargaining” for the hostages and instead taking military action to punish Iran if the hostages were not released. He suggested occupying three Iranian-controlled islands in the Persian Gulf. “The most likely outcome of this situation is an eventual replacement of the present fanatic Shiite Muslim government, either by a military one or a combination of the military with the civilian democratic leaders,” Mr. Rockefeller argued, according to his talking points for meetings with the Reagan transition team. An heir to his family’s oil fortune, Mr. Rockefeller styled himself a corporate statesman and personally knew many White House officials, including Mr. Carter. He had known the shah since 1962, socializing with him in New York, Tehran and St. Moritz, Switzerland.  As Tehran’s coffers swelled with oil revenues in the 1970s, Chase formed a joint venture with an Iranian state bank and earned big fees advising the national oil company.  By 1979, the bank had syndicated more than $1.7 billion in loans for Iranian public projects (the equivalent of about $5.8 billion today). The Chase balance sheet held more than $360 million in loans to Iran and more than $500 million in Iranian deposits. Mr. Rockefeller often insisted that his concern for the shah was purely about Washington’s “prestige and credibility.” It was about “the abandonment of a friend when he needed us most,” he wrote in his memoirs.  His only advocacy for the shah, Mr. Rockefeller wrote, had been in a brief aside to Mr. Carter during an unrelated White House meeting in April 1979. “I did nothing more, publicly or privately, to influence the administration’s thinking.” Yet the Project Eagle papers show that Mr. Rockefeller received detailed updates on the risks to Chase’s holdings, and that even his aside to Mr. Carter in April had been planned out the previous day with Mr. Reed, Mr. McCloy and Mr. Kissinger. Over lunch at the Knickerbocker Club in New York, Mr. Carter’s special envoy to Tehran, Gen. Robert E. Huyser, told the Project Eagle team that he had urged Iran’s top military leaders to kill as many demonstrators as necessary to keep the shah in power. If shooting over the heads of demonstrators failed to disperse them, “move to focusing on the chests,” General Huyser said he told the Iranian generals, according to minutes of the lunch. “I got stern and noisy with the military,” he added, but in the end, the top general was “gutless.”  Mr. Rockefeller had his own special envoy to try to help the shah: Robert F. Armao, a Republican operative and public relations consultant who had worked for Mr. Rockefeller’s brother Nelson, the former governor of New York and former vice president.  Mr. Armao became one of the shah’s closest advisers, and after Nelson Rockefeller died at the start of 1979, he reported to the Project Eagle team at Chase nearly every day for more than two years. “Everybody had the hope that there would be a repeat of the 1953 events,” Mr. Armao recalled recently, referring to the American-backed coup that restored the shah the first time he fled. When the shah’s rule became untenable at the start of 1979, the State Department first turned to David Rockefeller for help relocating the Iranian monarch in the United States. “Not large enough for my very special client,” Mr. Reed wrote to a Greenwich, Conn., broker who had offered two estates priced at around $2 million each — about $7.4 million today. But while the shah tarried in Egypt and Morocco, an Iranian mob briefly seized the American Embassy in February. Diplomats warned that admitting the shah risked another assault, and Mr. Carter changed his mind about offering haven.  Mr. Rockefeller refused to deliver this bad news to the shah, afraid that it would hurt the bank by alienating a prized client. “The risks were too high relating to the CMB position in Iran,” he responded, referring to Chase Manhattan Bank, according to the records. Instead, Mr. Rockefeller scrambled to find accommodations elsewhere — first in the Bahamas, and then in Mexico — while strategizing with Mr. Kissinger, Mr. McCloy and others about how to persuade the White House to let in the shah.  During a three-day push in April, Mr. Kissinger made a personal appeal to the national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and a follow-up phone call to Mr. Carter. Mr. Rockefeller buttonholed the president at the White House.  And in a speech, Mr. Kissinger publicly accused the Carter administration of forcing a loyal ally to sail the world in search of refuge, “like a flying Dutchman looking for a port of call” — the seed of what became a “who lost Iran” campaign theme for the Republicans.  Mr. McCloy flooded the White House with lengthy letters to senior officials, often arguing about the danger of demoralizing other “friendly sovereigns.” “Dear Zbig,” he addressed his old friend Mr. Brzezinski.  Finally, in October, Mr. Reed sent his personal doctor to Cuernavaca, Mexico, “to take a ‘look-see’” at the shah. He had been hiding a cancer diagnosis. The doctor, Benjamin H. Kean, determined that the shah needed sophisticated treatment within a few weeks — in Mexico, if necessary, Dr. Kean later said he had concluded. But when Mr. Reed put the doctor in touch with State Department officials, they came away with a different prognosis: that the shah was “at the point of death” and that only a New York hospital “was capable of possibly saving his life,” as Mr. Carter described it at the time to The Times. With that opening, the Chase team began preparing the flight to Fort Lauderdale. “When I told the Customs man who the principal was, he almost fainted,” the waiting executive, Eugene Swanzey, reported the next morning. The plane’s bathroom was malfunctioning. The shah and his wife hunted in vain for a missing videocassette to finish a movie. And their four dogs — a poodle, a collie, a cocker spaniel and a Great Dane — jumped on everyone. The Great Dane “hadn’t been washed in weeks,” Mr. Swanzey said. “The aroma was just terrible.” When Mr. Reed met the plane on its final arrival in New York, he recalled the next day, the shah seemed to be thinking, “‘At last I am getting into competent hands.’”  But as he checked the shah into New York Hospital, Mr. Reed was circumspect. “I am the unidentified American,” he told the inquisitive staff. Mr. Reed, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Kissinger met again three days after the hostages were taken.  “Noted was the feeling of indignation as being high and nothing useful to say,” read the minutes.  The White House said the shah had to depart as soon as possible, but Project Eagle continued. “The ideal place for the Eagle to land,” Mr. Reed wrote to Mr. Armao on Nov. 9, forwarding a brochure for a 350-acre Hudson Valley estate.  A week later, Mr. Rockefeller personally urged Mr. Carter in a phone call to direct the secretary of state to meet with the shah about “the current situation.” Mr. Carter did not and the shah soon departed, for Panama, then Egypt.  Only after the death of the shah, on July 27, 1980, nine months after his landing in Fort Lauderdale, did the Project Eagle team shift to new objectives. One was protecting Mr. Rockefeller from blame for the crisis. Over roast loin of veal and vintage wine at the exclusive River Club in New York, Mr. Rockefeller and nine others on the team gathered on Aug. 19. Amid discussion of a laudatory biography of the shah by a Berkeley professor that the team had commissioned, some warned that a Rockefeller link to the embassy seizure would be hard to escape.  Why was the shah admitted? “Medical treatment/DR recommended,” one said, using Mr. Rockefeller’s initials, according to minutes of the dinner. “This association cannot be ignored.”  But Mr. Kissinger was reassuring. Congress would never hold an investigation during an election campaign. “I don’t think we are in trouble any more, David,” Mr. Kissinger told him. The hostages were released on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1981, and a few days later Mr. Carter’s departing White House counsel called Mr. Rockefeller to inquire about how the release deal affected Chase bank. “Worked out very well,” Mr. Rockefeller told him, according to his records. “Far better than we had feared.”   ']",The fateful decision in 1979 to admit Mohammed Reza Pahlavi prompted the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran and helped doom the Carter presidency.
"Growing a Little Marijuana at Home Is Not a Crime, Italy’s Top Court Says",2019-12-27,By Anna Momigliano,"['ROME — Growing small amounts of marijuana at home for private use is not a crime, Italy’s top court has ruled, putting an end to a yearslong legal dispute and adding Italy to the short list of countries to allow cultivation of recreational cannabis. A 1990s law prohibits the cultivation and sale of marijuana in Italy, but conflicting court decisions, and a 2016 amendment that opened a loophole in the law, created confusion over how it should be interpreted. The country’s highest court appears to have settled at least part of the question, writing in a one-page statement of its findings that “at home, small-scale cultivation activities are to be considered excluded from the application of the penal code.” The judges produced the document on Dec. 19 and it was first publicized on Thursday by the news agency AGI. A full, detailed ruling remains weeks or months away, so the court’s complete reasoning has not been made public.  Among the unanswered questions is how much cannabis qualifies as “small-scale cultivation,” but the ruling stemmed from a case in which the defendant had two plants. The court appears to have stopped short of outright legalizing marijuana, but has decriminalized small-scale, private cultivation, meaning that while it might still be technically illegal, it is not treated as a serious crime and carries only light penalties. “It’s a very important decision, because it will shield from prison those who choose to cultivate marijuana for personal use,” said Leonardo Fiorentini, a representative of the drug policy advocacy group Forum Droghe. Only a handful of countries have, to varying degrees, legalized possession or cultivation of small amounts of cannabis for recreational use, most of them recently. Lawmakers in Uruguay voted in 2013 to remove the prohibition, and the law went into full effect in 2017. In 2018, Canada’s Parliament legalized marijuana, and the Supreme Courts of both Mexico and South Africa struck down their bans. In Spain, a law has been in place for decades that allows small-scale, private growing and use of the drug, but the number of people taking advantage of it has grown rapidly in the past decade. A few other countries have decriminalized limited possession, cultivation or both. They include the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Colombia and Chile. Still others allow marijuana for medical use, including Italy, where the army has a monopoly on commercial growing and a marijuana greenhouse in Florence. In 2013, a court in Torre Annunziata, a small town in southern Italy, sentenced a man, identified in court records only as CG, to one year in prison and a fine of 3,000 euros for growing two cannabis plants at home. He appealed the decision, first to a higher court in Naples and eventually to Italy’s Corte Suprema di Cassazione, the supreme court. Unlike its American counterpart, Italy’s supreme court is divided into multiple sections for different areas of law, and they had come to differing conclusions about small-scale cultivation of marijuana. The confusion stemmed partly from disagreement about how to apply the broader ban on cultivation to growing for private use, and how to apply a 2016 amendment that allowed people to grow and sell “light cannabis,” with low levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient.  As a result, Pietro Faraguna, a constitutional law professor at the University of Trieste, said that Italian courts — including the supreme court itself — have struggled to put the laws into practice. Given the contradictory rulings, in August the court asked for a ruling by its own highest authority, the Sezioni Unite, or joint sections — in effect, the supreme court of the supreme court. The Sezioni Unite ruled that the “rudimentary techniques” and “the small amount produced” in small-scale home growing makes it irrelevant to the illegal drug trade that the criminal law is intended to address. Now the court “has clearly said cultivating cannabis alone is not enough,” to be a crime, Mr. Faraguna said, setting a binding precedent.  But Mr. Fiorentini said the ruling illustrated the failure of Italy’s lawmakers, because they should make clear what their statutes mean, rather than asking judges to cut through the confusion. “Courts are bailing out politics, because politics is indecisive on the issue,” he said.']",The ruling adds Italy to the small number of countries where small-scale cultivation for personal use is allowed.
"North Korea Is No Longer Bound by Nuclear Test Moratorium, Kim Says",2019-12-31,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, \u200bsaid his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, its official media reported on Wednesday, the strongest indication yet that the country could soon resume such tests. Mr. Kim also said the world would witness a new strategic weapon “in the near future,” according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, though no details were provided. North Korea has not conducted a long-range missile test or a nuclear test in more than two years. Mr. Kim had announced his moratorium at a time when he hoped negotiations with the United States — and his budding personal relationship with President Trump — would prompt the United States to begin lifting crippling sanctions.  Mr. Trump, who has met Mr. Kim three times, has often cited the North’s restraint as a major diplomatic achievement. Speaking with reporters Tuesday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump said he still had a “very good relationship” with Mr. Kim. The North had set a Dec. 31 deadline for the United States to make at least some concessions, complaining that its 18 months of diplomacy with Mr. Trump had yielded limited results. And for weeks, American officials feared Mr. Kim might test an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, to make his point.  During the party meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Kim said his country “will shift to a shocking actual action” that will make the United States “pay for the pains sustained by our people,” the North Korean news agency said.  It remained unclear if a test was imminent. It is possible that Mr. Kim’s announcement on Wednesday is, by itself, the warning shot he wants to send to prod Mr. Trump, on the eve of a presidential election year, to begin lifting sanctions. All of the North’s state media gave prominent coverage to Mr. Kim’s remarks, indicating that they may have replaced an annual New Year’s Day speech that he had been expected to deliver. In its New Year’s Day edition, the North’s main party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, filled its front page with Mr. Kim’s remarks, including an exhortation to his people to “foil the enemies’ sanctions.”  Mr. Kim, who had hoped to shift his focus to finally reviving his country’s economy, has been growing frustrated in recent months as his negotiations on denuclearization with the Trump administration have stalled.  He made the latest remarks about the moratorium on Tuesday, the last day of a four-day meeting of the Workers’ Party Central Committee, the North’s highest decision-making body. The remarks threatened a major shift in North Korean policy.  He stressed that North Korea “should more actively push forward the project for developing strategic weapons\u200b” now that Washington’s “gangster-like acts” have stymied  economic growth. The unprecedented rapprochement between the United States and North Korea began nearly two years ago, after months of nuclear and ICBM tests and threats from both sides. Two months after Mr. Kim announced his moratorium — saying he had now completed his nuclear force — the two leaders met in Singapore in June 2018 in the first summit meeting between the two countries.  The summit ended with a commitment to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” but the pledge was never understood the same way by the two sides. The administration insisted that meant Mr. Kim would give up his nuclear weapons, his stockpile of fissile material and his missiles, but the North argued that it also meant the United States would withdraw troops and offshore ships and submarines that could launch nuclear weapons. Subsequent negotiations have failed to close the gap. Mr. Trump, speaking in Florida on Friday night, cited the Singapore pledge and said he considered Mr. Kim to be a “man of his word.” “I know that he is sending out certain messages about a Christmas present,” Mr. Trump added, reprising a line he had used before, “and I hope his present is a beautiful vase.” But Mr. Kim’s words on Tuesday were much harsher. “If the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the D.P.R.K., there will never be denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,” he said, using the initials for the North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “The scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated depending on the U.S. future attitude to the D.P.R.K.”  That remark, and Mr. Kim’s reluctance to clarify when North Korea would officially resume testing, indicated that he might still be open to further negotiations with Washington. While the North has demonstrated that its fleet of missiles could likely reach parts of the United States, the country still has not shown it could design a nuclear warhead that would survive the heat and huge forces that come with re-entry of a warhead into the atmosphere. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday night that the Trump administration continued to hope that Mr. Kim would “take a different course.” “President Trump came into office with the threat of war from North Korea real, and a true concern for the American people. He took a tack — we said we can deliver a better outcome for the people of North Korea,” Mr. Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News. “We’re hopeful that Chairman Kim will make the right decision, and he’ll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,” he added. Washington had dismissed the Dec. 31 deadline imposed by the North as “artificial,” urging  Pyongyang to maintain a dialogue and not revert to the provocations that had raised fears of war on the Korean Peninsula two years ago. Since taking over his country following the death of his father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, Mr. Kim has accelerated his country’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. North Korea has conducted the last four of its six underground nuclear tests under Mr. Kim. It flight-tested three intercontinental ballistic missile tests in 2017. As his diplomacy with Mr. Trump has failed to bring about the benefits he had sought, especially the lifting or easing of sanctions, Mr. Kim has sounded increasingly impatient. North Korea broke an 18-month hiatus in weapons tests in May, launching 27 mostly short-range ballistic missiles and rocket since then and warning of more provocative tests to come. In December, it conducted two ground tests at its missile-engine test site to bolster what it called its “nuclear deterrent.” At the same time, Mr. Kim has exhorted his people not to expect any immediate easing of sanctions and to brace for a prolonged struggle against the Americans by building a “self-reliant” economy.    David E. Sanger contributed reporting.']","Kim Jong-un said North Korea was free of a self-imposed pause on testing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, which President Trump had called a diplomatic victory."
"Voracious Appetite for Sea Cucumbers Fuels a Farm Boom, but at a Cost",2019-12-29,By Steven Lee Myers and Gilles Sabrié,"['GUANGLU ISLAND, China — Sea cucumbers are like chickens, Cong Xuanzhi explained. He did not mean the taste. He was describing how sea cucumbers, the unlovely cousins of starfish and sea urchins, end up on the tables of the Chinese today. “Some are raised in pens,” Mr. Cong said, wearing blue overalls and white rubber boots, and standing outside a long cinder-block building that contained 54 pools filled with sea cucumbers, redolent of the sea. “And some are free range.” That’s a figure of speech, strictly speaking, since the creatures barely move in their lives. Mr. Cong’s comment, though, highlights yet another consequence of China’s enormous economic transformation, which has lifted millions of people out of poverty and also stoked a voracious appetite for delicacies like the sea cucumber. In China, sea cucumbers have been highly prized for centuries for their nutritional value and texture, if not their flavor. They are believed to have medicinal properties, treating ailments from arthritis to impotency. In their wild state, though, they have become a rarity, even on Guanglu Island, off the Liaodong Peninsula, which is famous for them. In a few decades, demand has all but depleted the natural stocks of the local species. So the authorities have turned to aquaculture — with some of the animals raised in sedentary conditions in pens or ponds near the shoreline, while others are raised in the sea in something approximating their natural habitat. Those are considered free range. The entire effort is fueling a boom in the local economy that has reshaped the Liaodong coast.  Huge stretches of tidal flatlands northeast of Dalian, the peninsula’s port city, have been carved into patchworks of ponds so vast they are visible in satellite maps.  The ponds, fed by ocean water, are seeded with young sea cucumbers that, within a year, grow large enough to harvest. Farther inland, huge structures like Mr. Cong’s breed sea cucumbers that are destined for tidal ponds nearby or, in his case, as far away as Fujian, the southeastern province.  Some companies breed larvae and seed sections of the open sea with them that the government licenses to harvesting operations. “People here all rely on this,” said Liu Aiqing, who was recording the weight of the animals that divers pulled out of a nearby pond, larger than a football field. She used to work in a factory.  Sea cucumbers have become the most valuable farmed sea product in China, worth more than $8 billion a year, said Bao Pengyun, a marine biologist whose research at Dalian Ocean University contributed to the development of the industry in China. They are also good for the environment, feeding off the rocks and sand where they live, purifying the surrounding water. Their eradication would be devastating up and down the food chain. Homages to the sea cucumber abound in and around Dalian. Restaurants and markets have sea cucumber statues. There is a sea cucumber-themed resort, with hotels, a museum and a cartoon mascot. One of the most famous seafood restaurants in Dalian, Wanbao Seafood Fang, plays a video of sea cucumbers in an endless loop, including a subtitled clip from Fox News discussing how they might even be a “miracle cure” for cancer.  The Michelin online guide to Chinese cuisine offers this helpful guidance: “A book in the Ming dynasty notes its physical resemblance to men’s genitals, which might contribute to its popularity as an ingredient at that time, given the Chinese belief that one can reinforce a specific part of the body by eating food that are in a similar shape.”  The local variety, the Japanese spiky sea cucumber, is among the seven species of the animal listed as endangered — nine more are considered vulnerable — by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. By some estimates 70 percent of the world’s edible species of sea cucumbers are over exploited — from the South Pacific to the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Mexico. Like Mr. Cong and others in the industry, Mr. Bao, the marine biologist, thinks there is little difference between sea cucumbers raised in pens or free range, and those from the wild. “Very much the same,” he said. Not everyone agrees. “The difference is tangible,” said Mou Jie, who with friends drove two hours up the coast from Dalian to catch a ferry that deposited her nearly an hour later on Guanglu. She could have bought wild sea cucumbers in Dalian but instead waited in a blustery November chill for a flat-bottomed boat to pull ashore and unload its catch.  Wild sea cucumbers have wider and whiter spikes. Those from colder waters grow more slowly, typically three years instead of one, making them more nutritious. Here’s another difference: Wild ones, whether fresh, partially processed or dried, cost two to three times as much. The most expensive — dried — can cost almost $1,000 a kilogram.  “If you don’t lack money, you’ll buy this one,” said Yang Yufeng, a vendor at the main wholesale fish market in Dalian, pointing to the most expensive wild sea cucumbers he had.  The sluggish sea cucumbers might be easy to catch, but it is not easy work.  During the peak harvest season, as fall turns into winter, divers plunge into water that is about 48 degrees Fahrenheit, coming up for only short breaks to unload their mesh nets. They are paid according to the weight, and can earn the equivalent of several hundred dollars a day. Under Chinese law, those harvested by divers here cannot be sold as wild because they come from seeded stock, meaning those partially raised with human help have intermingled with the wild ones. “We just say that they are sea cucumbers from the deep sea,” said Hao Junze, the chief executive officer of Dalian Caishen Island Group, the company that operates the concessions on the sea floor around Guanglu. Mr. He said his company has not seeded the area since 2013, effectively restoring it to something like the wild it once was. Our stock, he said, “is naturally breeding on its own.”  Ms. Mou and her friends bought about 800 fresh sea cucumbers, enough to last the whole winter, and watched in the cold as three workers gutted the animals with box cutters and piled them in a heaping, muddy mess. So about the taste: Haters, and there are many, say sea cucumbers are flavorless and have the texture of cartilage or, worse, rubber.  When plucked alive from the sea, blanched lightly and bathed in, say, a sauce of garlic, cilantro and chili oil — as they are served at a small fish restaurant not far away — they taste like a rubbery piece of cartilage, bathed in a sauce of garlic, cilantro and chili oil.  In short, not bad at all. Steven Lee Myers is a veteran diplomatic and national security correspondent, now based in the Beijing bureau.

"A Couple Unwittingly Threw Away $20,000. The Dump Gave It Back.",2019-12-31,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — When a British couple dropped off a few boxes at a waste and recycling center after clearing out the house of a dead relative a few weeks ago, they drove off with no idea what they had really left behind. Tucked away inside one of the boxes was 15,000 pounds in cash —\xa0nearly $20,000. Luckily for the pair, according to a statement released by the police on Friday, a hawk-eyed — and honest\xa0— employee at the waste center helped ensure that the money made its way back to them. When the team at the recycling center, at Midsomer Norton in southwestern England, suddenly found themselves with the unexplained box brimming with hundreds of £20 notes in a place where garden waste and broken furniture and electrical items are the usual fare, they started by calling the police.  Then, with the help of technology and a little ingenuity, they tracked down the couple who had unwittingly left the money behind, who turned out to live 27 miles away in the coastal town of Burnham-on-Sea. First, the staff members ran through the dump’s CCTV footage until a man was spotted on camera leaving the box behind.  After watching him on video returning to his car, the workers matched it to its license plate, which had been automatically scanned by cameras that track all vehicles driving into the depot. And the police soon traced the car’s owner and address. Without revealing what exactly had been discovered, the Avon and Somerset Police interviewed the couple in their home and at a police station until they were satisfied that their account of events aligned with the property abandoned at the recycling center. “No details of the discovery were disclosed to the couple,” David Bowen, a police employee who worked on the case, said in a statement on Monday, adding that once the pair were interviewed, there was “no doubt” that the money belonged to them. A police spokeswoman said that the couple were in their mid- to late 60s and did not want to be identified.  The family was “shocked” and “aghast” when they learned of the substantial amount of cash found among what they had thought were worthless items, the police said. But the couple were not entirely surprised: They told the police that the dead relative had had a habit of hiding money around the house. As for the recycling center staff, although the Metropolitan Police say that anyone who finds valuable property should make “reasonable enquiries” to find the owner, the workers in this case were praised for their actions and detective work that went above and beyond expectations.  “Without their diligent attitude, integrity and assistance, the family would never have known about the money found, and we would not have been able to return it to them, especially in time for Christmas,” the police statement said. The police said on Monday that the couple had given a reward to the staff member who came across the money — and who could have been in line to claim it if the owners had not been found within six weeks — but did not specify what it was.  The local council responsible for the recycling center said on Monday that the worker who had made the discovery was not available to speak to news media. Instead, the council said in a tweet, the employee was “having a well-deserved Christmas break.”']","The money, hidden in a box of possessions from a deceased relative, was returned thanks to a hawk-eyed (and honest) worker.

It’s 50 Below. The Past Is a Horror Show. You’d Dream of Escaping Too.,2019-12-31,By Andrew Higgins,"['MAGADAN, Russia — Like many young people in Magadan, a frigid northern Russian city more than 3,600 miles from Moscow, Dinat Yur is fed up with living in a place where winters drag on for six months and the average annual temperature is below freezing. “I really dream of leaving this place,” said Mr. Yur, a 29-year-old cook. “I can’t wait.” Born and raised in a city proud of its resilience against climatic and all other odds, Mr. Yur has for the moment found his calling in a defiantly contrarian occupation for a place so cold: He makes ice cream. As the temperature in Magadan dipped the other week to well below freezing — on its way to minus 50 Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit) once winter really sets in — he was hard at work mixing milk, sugar and a raspberry mush imported from Italy to produce a summery swirl of frozen gelato. Eating his confections outside during winter, Mr. Yur conceded, is not a good idea — they quickly turn to teeth-cracking chunks of ice — but “everyone here likes to sit at home in front of the TV with some ice cream.” Russia’s curious love affair with ice cream has long been a subject of theorizing about how a country plagued by such terrible weather and other miserable conditions manages to keep going, prevailing over seemingly unsurmountable hurdles.  Particularly popular in Russia is a story, probably apocryphal, about a visit to Moscow in the winter of 1944 by Winston Churchill that has Britain’s wartime leader noticing Muscovites eating ice cream on a snowy street from his car window and declaring “such a people will never be conquered.” Moscow, however, has winters that usually hover in the 20s Fahrenheit — meaning that Magadan is pushing the limits of this against-the-odds spirit.  Burdened by its Stalin-era beginnings as the gateway to a string of brutal labor camps in nearby Kolyma — where tens of thousands were executed and more than 100,000 died from disease and hunger — the city is trying to rebrand itself cheerily as the “golden heart of Russia,” a reference to vast reserves of gold buried in nearby mountains. Built on an icy bay overlooking the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, Magadan is Russia’s version of Dawson City, the Canadian town created by the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century. Only Russians never rushed to Magadan; they were dragged there. The only recent rush has been to the exit.  Young people particularly are making a run for it, a stampede that the city’s mayor, Yuri Grishin, has been working to slow. He points to a new sports complex now under construction, a rash of restaurant openings and fresh licks of paint for buildings in the center of town as possible encouragement for people to stay put.  After years of dramatic decline that slashed the population by more than 40 percent, the mayor said the number of residents has now “more or less stabilized” at around 91,000. But among those who have moved away are the mayor’s own three grown children. One now lives in Moscow.  The mayor doesn’t understand. Why would anyone trade Magadan for the capital, where “they will live in a tiny apartment and spend three hours a day in traffic jams,” he asked. Aside from its bleak weather and even bleaker history, Magadan is, if truth be told, no worse — and in some respects better — than many provincial Russian towns. It has the same crumbling concrete apartment blocks, the same colonnaded theater building, the same central square formerly named after Lenin and the same street slogans celebrating victory in the Great Patriotic War, as Russia refers to World War II. It also has three movie houses, two indoor public swimming pools, a well-deserved reputation for camaraderie and a huge new Orthodox cathedral with glittering golden domes, an indispensable feature of urban planning in the age of President Vladimir V. Putin.  Another plus is climate change, which is making winters somewhat milder. It did not start snowing heavily this year until late November. But thoughts of escaping, either by eating Italian gelato or getting on a plane, are so ever-present that a local sociologist diagnosed Magadan as suffering from “delayed life syndrome” — a psychological condition that detaches inhabitants’ hopes and ambitions from their current life and punts them into the future. “People think they are just here temporarily and that they will only live fully once they leave,” said Andrei Grishan, 31, the founder and editor of an online local news portal, Vesma Today. Recently married, he and his new wife both said they want to leave at some point. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Magadan had 155,000 people. They were a mix of locally born residents — many of them descendants of former gulag prisoners, guards or administrators — and outsiders attracted by salaries that had for years been far higher than in the rest of the country. That was thanks to the “northern bonus,” a Soviet-era premium offered to anyone willing to work there. But for many people in Magadan, the end of the Soviet Union meant economic ruin. The slashing of Soviet-era subsidies sent Magadan salaries tumbling. As factories closed and services withered, some free-market zealots in Moscow suggested that the city be put out of its misery and shut down. Mr. Putin, though, has done the opposite, stressing the importance of keeping remote northern outposts alive, no matter the cost. His calculations include security, patriotic pride in Russia’s reach, and economics: Most of Russia’s natural resources lie beneath the ice and snow of places like Magadan and the nearby wilds. The federal government subsidizes daily flights to and from Moscow and is funding new roads, the new sports complex and high-speed internet lines. Government subsidies also help keep the interest rate on mortgages in town much lower than in warmer parts of Russia. Since 2016, Moscow has been offering free land in Magadan and other sparsely populated regions of the Russian Far East. Four hundred people have taken up the offer in the Magadan region, but nearly all are locals, not would-be settlers from the outside as the Kremlin had hoped. While Magadan is blessed with rich supplies of gold, silver and other natural resources, conditions are so harsh that some economists still question whether it makes sense to keep it as a city rather than just a transit center for contract workers heading for the mines. But giving up on Magadan as a functioning urban center would effectively return it to its original role when it was founded in 1929 — a grim seaport through which geologists and then gulag laborers passed on their way to the gold mines of Kolyma. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the author of “The Gulag Archipelago,” described this particular outpost of the gulag as “the pole of cold and cruelty.” When Mr. Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994 after years of exile in Vermont, he made Magadan his first stop, explaining upon his arrival from Alaska that he had “come to bow to the land where many hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, who were executed, are buried.” Even today, residents still refer to the rest of Russia as “the mainland,” a sign of how isolated the city feels. To lift flagging spirits, municipal buses are emblazoned with a defiant statement of the city’s will to survive: “Magadan was, is and will be.”  The phrase borrows, inauspiciously, from a less-than-successful Soviet-era slogan once plastered across the country: “Lenin lived, lives and will live!” Because of the flight of young people, Magadan now has a severe shortage of able-bodied workers. The mayor said the city needed 20,000 more people to do construction and other work and is making do in the meantime by bringing in workers on short-term contracts. “It upsets me that people have this stereotype of Magadan as a big prison camp,” the mayor said. The city, he added, is “repositioning itself as a bright, colorful and happy place.” Mr. Yur, the ice-cream maker, is not convinced. He tries to take a holiday each summer somewhere in Asia, which is much closer than Europe and most of Russia. But returning home to Magadan is always a trial. “When I come back here,” he said, “I slip into a deep depression.”']",
Bolivia Expels 3 Diplomats in Tiff With Mexico and Spain Over Morales Aides,2019-12-30,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Raphael Minder,"['Bolivia’s interim government expelled three senior Spanish and Mexican diplomats from the country on Monday, dramatically escalating a diplomatic spat caused by the downfall of President Evo Morales. Bolivia’s caretaker president, Jeanine Añez, gave Mexico’s ambassador and Spain’s chargé d’affaires and its consul in La Paz, the nation’s main city, 72 hours to leave, accusing them of breaking diplomatic norms by aiding former officials linked to Mr. Morales. “This group of representatives of the governments of Mexico and Spain have gravely damaged the sovereignty and dignity of the people and the government” of Bolivia, Ms. Añez said Monday at a news conference.  Spain’s government responded by expelling three Bolivian diplomats on Monday. Mexico’s Foreign Ministry called Bolivia’s move “political” but did not immediately retaliate. The surprise expulsions by Bolivia were the latest and most drastic step taken by Ms. Añez to reshape foreign and domestic policy since succeeding Mr. Morales in November. Mr. Morales fled to Mexico last month, after stepping down under pressure from street protesters and the military. He later traveled to Argentina.  Since assuming the presidency, Ms. Añez has kicked out hundreds of Cuban workers, halted formal recognition of Nicolás Maduro as Venezuela’s president, begun a legal crusade against top officials under Mr. Morales and brought religious symbols back into the ceremonies of the explicitly secular state. Her critics say these measures go well beyond her self-professed mission as a caretaker to oversee new elections early next year.  Ms. Añez’s shake-up of diplomatic ties could have lasting political and economic consequences for the next president. Of particular concern would be any political fallout with Spain, a significant investment partner whose government helped broker Ms. Añez’s ascension. “Frankly, there’s very little for Bolivia to gain from this over the long term,” said Filipe Carvalho, a Washington-based risk analyst with the Eurasia Group, a consultancy firm. “These measures are counterproductive.” Ms. Añez’s diplomatic saber-rattling instead serves a short-term political goal, he said: mobilizing Mr. Morales’s staunch opponents ahead of elections. “This is a very polarized country, and some here really want to get back at the people who held power for 14 years” under Mr. Morales, Mr. Carvalho said. The recent diplomatic tensions have centered around 10 officials from Mr. Morales’s inner circle who sought asylum in the Mexican diplomatic premises in La Paz after the former president fled into exile. The caretaker government has accused three of them of sedition and electoral fraud and issued warrants for their arrests. Officials in the Añez administration said Mexico had broken diplomatic norms by allowing asylum seekers to conduct political activity and move in diplomatic vehicles. Mexico’s left-wing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, initially drew Bolivia’s ire for granting Mr. Morales, an ally, temporary asylum and sending a military plane to pick him up at his Bolivian hide-out. The tensions exploded into the open last week after the Spanish government unexpectedly became involved. On Friday, two Spanish diplomatic cars, driven by masked security officers, tried to enter the Mexican ambassador’s residence in La Paz, fueling suspicions that Spain was trying to quietly intervene in the standoff.  In an attempt to diffuse the spat, the Spanish government sent a commission to investigate the episode, without explaining why its officials had covered their faces and refused to identify themselves to the Bolivian police. Some local residents and politicians were outraged, accusing Spain, a former colonial power, of disrespect and arrogance. “The times of Pizarro and Cortés are over,” said Jorge Quiroga, a former president of Bolivia who is a prominent commentator. “By these actions, they have thrown away decades of work they spent improving their image in the country.” Cesar Del Castillo and Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting.']","The caretaker president accused the Mexican ambassador and two Spanish diplomats of breaking norms by aiding former officials linked to Evo Morales, the ousted president."
"China Sentences Wang Yi, Christian Pastor, to 9 Years in Prison",2019-12-30,By Paul Mozur and Ian Johnson,"[""HONG KONG — A secretive Chinese court sentenced one of the country’s best-known Christian voices and founder of one of its largest underground churches to nine years in prison for subversion of state power and illegal business operations, according to a government statement released on Monday. Wang Yi, the pastor who founded Early Rain Covenant Church, was detained last December with more than 100 members of his congregation as part of a crackdown on churches, mosques and temples not registered with the state. While most of Mr. Wang’s parishioners, including his wife, Jiang Rong, were eventually released, Mr. Wang never re-emerged from detention.  As part of his sentence, he will also be stripped of his political rights for three years and have 50,000 renminbi, or almost $7,200, of his assets seized, according to the statement.  Mr. Wang had become known for taking high-profile positions on politically sensitive issues, including forced abortions and the massacre that crushed the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989.  A lawyer by training, Mr. Wang was a well-known blogger before converting to Christianity in 2005. Just a few months later, he was selected to meet President George W. Bush at the White House as part of a program to reach out to Chinese Christians. More recently, he emerged as a critic of Xi Jinping, China's leader, who ushered in more authoritarian policies and abolished term limits. “Pastor Wang Yi was just sentenced to 9 years in prison for proclaiming the gospel,” read a statement posted to a Facebook page run by church supporters, which added, “May the Lord use Pastor Wang Yi’s imprisonment to draw many to himself and to bring glory to his name.” The government in November sentenced another church leader, Qin Defu, to four years in prison for the charge of illegal business operations. While the charge of inciting to subvert state power reflects Mr. Wang’s political views, the illegal business operations highlight a more widespread and troubling problem for the government: Early Rain and hundreds of other unregistered churches across China are no longer just small, underground gatherings of believers in people’s homes, but are large, sophisticated organizations.  At its peak in 2018, Early Rain had more than 500 members, a seminary that trained clergy from across China, a kindergarten and elementary school, and a bookstore — none of which were registered with the government. Mr. Wang’s arrest is part of a broader effort to subdue all social organizations that operate independently of the government.  In 2017, the government passed a law sharply curtailing the rights of nongovernmental organizations. That same year it enacted new regulations on religious life. In both cases, groups were ordered to register with the government and cut all foreign ties. Around the same time, the government began a policy of detaining more than a million Muslims in what it calls re-education camps.  Compared to the country’s 20 million Muslims, most of whom are ethnic minorities, Protestant Christianity is practiced by 60 million ethnic Chinese, who are often white-collar professionals living in the country’s heartland. The vast majority of China’s independent churches have been untouched by the recent crackdown, but observers said the attack on high-profile churches was a signal to others to reduce their size and avoid politics. In addition to closing Early Rain, the government last year shuttered Zion Church in Beijing and Rongguili in Guangzhou. “The government is worried about the development of these churches,” said Ying Fuk-tsang, the director of the Divinity School at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “They think there are too many, and they are going against the bigger ones to solve the problem in this fashion.” Mr. Wang, who founded Early Rain in the city of Chengdu, rejected the idea that his church should avoid political issues in order to operate unmolested by the authorities. In a 2017 sermon on the issue, he shared a quote that he attributed to Hermann Hesse, saying it was “better to harm your body 10 times over than to harm your soul once.” In a statement posted on Facebook, the church said that Mr. Wang had committed no crime and had always supported the separation of church and state. “He has taught that even when the church is being persecuted, Christians should be willing to submit to the government’s physical restrictions of them as well as to the deprivation of their property,” the statement said. “He has never said or done anything that amounts to ‘inciting to subvert state power.’” Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Ian Johnson from London.""]",The founder of one of China’s largest unregistered churches was given a lengthy sentence for what the government called subversion of state power.
Apocalyptic Scenes in Australia as Fires Turn Skies Blood Red,2019-12-31,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — As the fire stalked the east coast of Australia on Tuesday, the daytime sky turned inky black, then blood red. Emergency sirens wailed, followed by the thunder of gas explosions. Thousands of residents fled their homes and huddled near the shore. There was nowhere else to go.  Apocalyptic scenes like these in Mallacoota, a vacation destination between Sydney and Melbourne, came on the last day of the warmest decade on record in Australia.  The country is in the grip of a devastating fire season, with months of summer still to go, as record-breaking temperatures, strong winds and prolonged drought have ignited huge blazes across the country. The government prepared to deploy navy vessels and military helicopters to help fight the fires and evacuate people.  The devastation is immense. In the state of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, more than 900 homes have been destroyed and nine million acres have burned since November. Almost 100 fires were still raging in the state on Tuesday, with about three dozen more across the border in Victoria.  At least 15 people have died, with eight deaths confirmed on Monday and Tuesday. Australia is normally hot and dry in summer, but climate change, which brings more frequent and longer periods of extreme heat, worsens these conditions and makes vegetation drier and more likely to burn. The country recently concluded its driest spring on record. That was followed in mid-December by the hottest day on record, with average highs across the country of 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit). Polls show a large majority of Australians view climate change as an urgent threat and want stronger government action to combat it. The catastrophic fire conditions have put an intense focus on the Australian government’s failure to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which traps heat when released into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison, a conservative, has made it clear that Australia’s economic prosperity comes first. Even as his country burned, he has said repeatedly that it is not the time to discuss climate policy.  “We have stood up to these terrible disasters before, and we have come through the other side,” he said in his New Year’s Eve address. “We will rebuild and we will stay strong.” [Update: 3 U.S. firefighters die in plane crash as Australia’s blazes intensify.] As Australia has seen a surge of climate activism in recent months, Mr. Morrison has gone so far as to suggest that the government should outlaw efforts by environmental groups to pressure businesses with rallies and boycotts. Other members of Mr. Morrison’s government have answered calls for action with insults; the deputy prime minister called people who care about global warming “raving inner-city lunatics.”  More recently, Mr. Morrison has been in damage control mode over his decision to vacation in Hawaii even as the authorities raised emergency fire warnings across the country. He cut the trip short after two volunteer firefighters died.  Those deaths raised new questions about Australia’s reliance on an overwhelmingly volunteer firefighting force. The physical and emotional toll on the thousands of unpaid firefighters has been mounting as some have worked shifts of 12 hours or more. After initially resisting calls to compensate firefighters, Mr. Morrison announced limited daily payments.  The fires have been a constant presence in Australia for weeks, but the eerie images that emerged on social media on Tuesday cast them in a new light, and seemed to be a harbinger for the new decade that the country rang in hours later. So heavy was the smoke, it even drifted over to neighboring New Zealand, 1,300 miles away, who woke up to a blood-red sun on New Year’s Day. In Mallacoota, where several homes were destroyed, residents in boats shared footage of themselves wearing masks and life vests as they waited under the blazing red sky. Others opted to stay and defend homes, likening burning trees to “exploding infernos” and describing the roar of the blazes. In Batemans Bay, four hours north, residents sat on folding chairs along the beach, life rafts at the ready, as a fire encircled the town and burned homes. To the south, in Cobargo, a father and son died in a blaze as they tried to protect the family home.  With several blazes burning out of control, thousands were stranded in evacuation centers in other towns along the coast as firefighters told people to stay put. Tens of thousands of people were without power, the Australian military was authorized to deploy aircraft and naval vessels, and the government requested firefighting help from Canada and the United States. Telecommunications remained down on Wednesday in a 200-mile stretch of threatened area on the southeast coast.  In Sydney, where heavy smoke from fires has obscured the sun many days this summer, officials rejected calls to cancel the city’s signature New Year’s Eve fireworks display after the Rural Fire Service in New South Wales approved the celebration. One blaze reached the western part of Sydney, threatening homes. The fires have been so fierce that they have created their own weather systems. On Monday night, a volunteer firefighter died after a phenomenon called a fire tornado — turbulence caused by extreme rising heat — in New South Wales caused a 10-ton fire truck to roll over.  The firefighter, Samuel McPaul, 28, was expected to become a father in May. He was the third volunteer firefighter to die this fire season; the other two, who also died in an accident involving a fire truck, were fathers of young children.  In Mallacoota, just over the border in the state of Victoria, residents had spent Monday night preparing to evacuate. As the fire approached, some gathered at a community center, while others climbed into boats in bodies of water.  “I’ve never seen anything like it,” said one man filming his escape on a boat. Ida Dempsey of Melbourne, who spends Christmas every year in the area with her family, also took refuge on the water.  “We couldn’t see a thing. It was pitch black,” Ms. Dempsey said. “We had face masks; the smoke was very bad.” She commended fire officials for keeping people calm. “If we didn’t have a plan, I would have panicked a bit more,” she said. In Batemans Bay, said James Findlay, who grew up there, the fire came so quickly that there was no hope to save his family home.  “Everything’s gone,” he said.  His parents, Mr. Findlay said, were in shock. “People have lost their homes, their farms, and people have lost their lives,” he said.  “If this isn’t some kind of a sign that more should be done, then I don’t know what is.”']",Thousands of people fled from their homes as wildfires raged on the last day of the warmest decade on record in Australia. 
Woman Who Accused 12 Men of Rape Is Guilty of ‘Public Mischief’ in Cyprus,2019-12-30,By Lizzy Ioannidou and Iliana Magra,"['PARALIMNI, Cyprus — A British woman was convicted by a Cyprus court on Monday for lying to the authorities when she accused a dozen Israeli men of raping her and later retracted her statement, the latest twist in a case that divided public opinion in Cyprus and Israel.  The British woman, who was 19 when she made the accusation and has not been publicly identified, had accused the men, who ranged in age from 15 to 18, of raping her in a hotel room in the resort town of Ayia Napa in July. The men were arrested that month but were later released after the police said the woman had retracted the accusations.  Marios Christou, the chief investigating officer in the case, testified during the legal proceedings that she had “admitted that she reported the incident” because the men “were recording her having sex” and “she felt insulted.” He also pointed to inconsistencies between her statement and video footage from the night on which she said she was raped.  On Monday, the Famagusta District Court in Cyprus convicted her of public mischief. She is due to be sentenced on Jan. 7 and could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 1,700 euros, or around $1,900. She can appeal the verdict, and her lawyers have asked for a suspended sentence. “She did not tell the truth, and tried to mislead the court,” said Michalis Papathanasiou, the judge in the case. “There was no rape, or violence, and the police had carried out a thorough investigation, making all necessary arrests.” On Monday, the court was full, and members of several women’s rights organizations attended in support of the woman on trial. The groups protested outside the court after the decision. The woman pleaded not guilty when her trial began on Oct. 2. But proceedings were paused when a separate hearing began later that month to determine whether the police had forced her to change her original statement and withdraw the rape accusation, as she claimed.  That hearing concluded on Nov. 28 when a judge ruled that her retraction was admissible as evidence in her initial trial, according to a statement last month from Justice Abroad, a legal charity that has assisted her. Mr. Christou, the investigating officer, testified that the police had not pressured her to change her stance. At her trial, the woman said that she was in a romantic relationship with one of the accused men, according to Justice Abroad. She testified that she had consensual sex with the man in his hotel room on July 17, but that he “turned more aggressive than usual.” Other young men then entered the room, she said, adding that she had told them to leave.  She said that one of the men had immobilized her by shoving his knees on her shoulders, and that because she lost consciousness during the episode, she did not know how many of the men had assaulted her, according to Justice Abroad.  She said that she eventually managed to escape, and then went to a nearby clinic. The doctor who examined her that day called the police.  The woman later told the court that the police had pressured her to retract the accusations on July 27 after she was held for four hours at a police station where she had been taken to give a voluntary statement. “They asked me to say that it wasn’t a rape,” she said in court. Andrea Nini, a forensic linguist, testified during the proceedings that it was likely that a paragraph in the statement had been dictated to the woman by someone who spoke English as a second language.  The woman’s legal team argued that she had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The woman also said that while she was in the police station, she was not allowed to call her mother, who was in Cyprus at the time. “I said, ‘Mum has a law degree, and I know my rights and I want a lawyer,’” she testified, adding that Mr. Christou told her that “maybe that’s allowed in the U.K., but not in Cyprus.” She spent more than a month in prison after being charged with public mischief, and has not been able to leave Cyprus for more than six months.  The initial allegations against the 12 men had led to soul searching in Israel, prompting conversations about societal pressures on young men to prove their manliness. But as the case against the men appeared to fall apart, many sprang to their defense, and their relieved families celebrated.  Despite general relief in Israel over the men’s release, many people raised ethical questions over issues like drunkenness and sexual consent, as well as reports that the woman had been recorded on video without her permission. Many Israelis were embarrassed by the celebratory scenes at the airport when the men arrived home and were greeted with singing and dancing. Nir Yaslovitch, an Israeli lawyer who represented several of the men, told the Hebrew news site Ynet on Monday that he was considering pursuing a civil case against the British woman for the damage caused to his clients. Lizzy Ioannidou reported from Paralimni, Cyprus, and Iliana Magra from London. Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem. ']","The British woman said that a dozen Israeli men had raped her in a resort town, and then retracted her statement. She could face up to a year in prison. "
Inside China’s Push to Turn Muslim Minorities Into an Army of Workers,2019-12-30,By Chris Buckley and Austin Ramzy,"['KASHGAR, China — The order from Chinese officials was blunt and urgent. Villagers from Muslim minorities should be pushed into jobs, willing or not. Quotas would be set and families penalized if they refused to go along. “Make people who are hard to employ renounce their selfish ideas,” the labor bureau of Qapqal, a county in the western region of Xinjiang, said in the directive last year.  Such orders are part of an aggressive campaign to remold Xinjiang’s Muslim minorities — mostly Uighurs and Kazakhs — into an army of workers for factories and other big employers. Under pressure from the authorities, poor farmers, small traders and idle villagers of working age attend training and indoctrination courses for weeks or months, and are then assigned to stitch clothes, make shoes, sweep streets or fill other jobs.  These labor programs represent an expanding front in a major effort by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to entrench control over this region, where these minorities make up about half the population. They are crucial to the government’s strategy of social re-engineering alongside the indoctrination camps, which have held one million or more Uighurs and Kazakhs. The labor bureau of Qapqal ordered that villagers should undergo military-style training to convert them into obedient workers, loyal to employers and the ruling Communist Party. “Turn around their ingrained lazy, lax, slow, sloppy, freewheeling, individualistic ways so they obey company rules,” the directive said.  The government maintains that the Uighur and Kazakh villagers are “rural surplus labor” and are an underemployed population that threatens social stability. Putting them in steady, supervised government-approved work, officials say, will erase poverty and slow the spread of religious extremism and ethnic violence.  The government describes the laborers as volunteers, though critics say they are clearly coerced. Official documents, interviews with experts, and visits by The New York Times to Xinjiang indicate that local plans uproot villagers, restrict their movements and pressure them to stay at jobs.  Experts say those harsh methods can amount to forced labor, potentially tainting the global supply chain that uses Xinjiang workers, particularly for cotton goods. The Japanese retailers Muji and Uniqlo say they have used cotton from the region, while Walmart has bought goods from a company that until recently used workers from Xinjiang. Given the tight control on Xinjiang, “we have to assume for the moment that there’s a very significant risk of coercion,” said Amy K. Lehr, director of the human rights initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the co-author of a study on Xinjiang’s labor programs.  Forced labor could arise “even if the coercion was implicit or the programs offered workers a decent income,” she added. The labor programs operate in parallel with the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang, that have drawn condemnation from Western governments. Camp inmates also receive job training, and officials say that many will be sent to work in factories.  Taken collectively, the policies are designed to make the region’s Muslim minorities more secular and urbanized like China’s Han majority. Many Chinese people see that as laudable. Uighur critics see it as ethnic subjugation. “What they are trying to do is assimilate the Uighur people,” said Mustafa Aksu, a program coordinator at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. The factory run by the Jinfujie Clothing Company on the sandy edge of Kashgar, a city in southern Xinjiang, has been a star in the government’s labor campaign.  Jinfujie, which calls itself Golden Future in English, trained and employed 2,300 workers from villages. It also opened a branch factory in an indoctrination camp, where it would put to work more than 500 inmates, a company executive told officials last year. The executive, Sun Yijie, a former soldier, said the company ran a tight ship to turn villagers into workers. “Beginning with military drills before they start their jobs, we foster a sense of discipline,” he said. Video footage posted online shows Jinfujie workers in gray-and-orange uniforms lined up for a pep rally. “A successful future,” they shouted in unison.  The company has said it won an order from Germany to make hundreds of thousands of ski pants. Jinfujie would not answer questions about the claimed order. During a recent visit, Times reporters were barred by guards from visiting the Jinfujie factory or the surrounding industrial zone.  Dozens of factory zones have emerged across Xinjiang, attesting to the government’s ambitions to remake the region. Mr. Xi, China’s leader, has vowed to end poverty nationwide by late 2020, and Xinjiang officials face intense pressure to create jobs. “The offensive to eradicate poverty has reached the crucial stage in a decisive battle,” Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, said early this month on a tour of southern Xinjiang. “Transmit the pressure down, level by level.” The labor programs depend on luring companies from China’s wealthier eastern seaboard, where fewer young people want to work on production lines. Xinjiang has offered manufacturers inexpensive labor, as well as generous tax breaks and subsidies. “They’re still not as fast as workers from other parts of China,” said He Tan, a businessman who owns a small factory on the outskirts of Hotan, a city in Xinjiang.  The government’s goals are sweeping. One plan issued in 2018 called for putting to work 100,000 people from the poorest parts of southern Xinjiang, a heavily Uighur area, by the end of 2020. The government recently said that target was met a year ahead of schedule.  By late 2023, another plan says, Xinjiang wants one million working in its textile and garment industries, up from about 100,000 in 2017.  At Mr. He’s factory, dozens of Uighur women from nearby villages sat wordlessly in rows sewing school uniforms. Guzalnur Mamatjan, a 20-year-old Uighur, said she made about $200 a month. “I’d like to work here for two or three years and then open my own clothes shop,” she said in a brief interview in the presence of officials. Jutting out against desert dunes, the new industrial zones in Xinjiang are often surrounded by high walls, barbed wire and security cameras. Some are built near indoctrination camps and employ former inmates. Xinjiang’s drive to put minorities in jobs often feels less like a jobs fair and more like a military call-up. Trainee laborers often first attend political courses similar to those used in the indoctrination camps. They practice military drills, learn patriotic Chinese songs, and listen to lectures warning against Islamic zeal and preaching gratitude to the Communist Party. New laborers are sometimes shown in Chinese media reports wearing military-type uniforms and standing to attention as they are escorted to their employers.  Many are separated from their families. A directive from the Qapqal government ordered children of working couples to be put in care — home villages for the young, boarding schools for older ones — so their parents could move for work. Workers’ movements are highly controlled if they are far from home. In Yanqi County in the region’s north, workers sent from the south are not allowed to quit unless they get written permission from several officials, according to rules by the local government. Labor recruits undergo “political vetting” to determine if they are a security risk. In Qapqal County, officials imposed rules to grade potential recruits from most to least trustworthy. The least trustworthy had to attend indoctrination classes in the evenings, while only the most trusted could leave the county for work. “There is a great deal of pressure placed on individuals to sign work contracts,” said Darren Byler, an expert on Xinjiang at the University of Colorado Boulder. Mr. Byler said many residents believed that resisting work transfers could prompt detention. “The threat of the camps hangs over everyone’s heads, so there is really no resistance to assigned factory work,” he said. Chinese official media reports that workers make $400 and up a month, a decent income. The reality may differ, especially in smaller, struggling factories. In a township in southern Xinjiang, two thirds of 43 factory employees whose wages were included in online records earned $114 a month, according to Adrian Zenz, an expert on Xinjiang who has studied the labor programs.  Amanzhol Qisa, a 31-year-old Xinjiang resident, spent a year in an indoctrination camp and in April was sent to work at a clothing factory for three months. She was paid $115 a month, less than half the minimum wage, according to her husband, Muhamet Qyzyrbek.  Mr. Qyzyrbek, a Kazakh citizen, said by phone from Shymkent, a city in southern Kazakhstan, that his wife had no choice but to take the job. “After being released, you need to work according to their policies,” he said. Starting in late summer, villagers in Xinjiang file onto buses taking them to cotton farms, sometimes hundreds of miles away. For a few intense weeks under the sun, they hunch over in fields, picking the crop that ends up in Chinese clothing factories. Teams of Communist Party officials in villages hold “mobilization meetings,” pressing farmers to sign up. The pay is good, they say.  “Head out boldly and bring back the cash,” a village official in Dol Township in southern Xinjiang told dozens of farmers, according a local government report last year. The village officials urged team leaders to take special care of three villagers in their 60s who had signed up to pick cotton, the report said. Xinjiang grows 85 percent of China’s cotton, by official estimates, and is pushing to make more textiles and garments. And nearly every link in the supply chain intersects with the government’s labor programs. Large Chinese textile makers, such as Huafu Fashion Company, based in eastern China, have promoted their role in employing minorities from the countryside, while denying that any were forced to take the work. Some global companies have advertised high-quality Xinjiang cotton as a selling point. The Japanese retailer Muji describes that its flannel uses “hand harvested” cotton from the region. The international concern over human rights in Xinjiang is putting pressure on global retailers to vet their suppliers. The United States recently banned clothing from Hetian Taida, a company in Xinjiang suspected of using workers from an indoctrination camp.  The parent company of the Japanese retailer Uniqlo said the brand stopped working with production partners in Xinjiang. Muji of Japan did not respond to emails requesting comment. In August, its parent company, Ryohin Keikaku, said it was committed to banning forced labor, including among its business partners. Until recently, Qapqal County had sent a total of over 440 workers to east China to work for a factory that makes inflatable paddle pools and beds for export to the United States and other countries. The factory is owned by the Bestway Leisure Products Company, which has sold such products to Walmart, Kmart and other retailers, according to export records.  Pat Fumagalli, a chief strategic officer for Bestway who is based in the United States, said the company ended the program to take workers from Xinjiang in October, after managers in the United States noted reports about the region’s labor programs. Marilee McInnis, a spokeswoman for Walmart, said in email: “Responsible recruitment and voluntary labor are two very important issues for Walmart.”  Transform Holdco, the parent company of Kmart, declined to comment. After The Times made inquiries, inspectors acting for Walmart visited the factory. The inspectors from the ICTI Ethical Toy Program examined records and spoke to managers. They found no disparity between the pay and conditions of workers from Xinjiang and other places, said Mark Robertson, a senior vice president for the inspection program.  “We did not have the opportunity to interview workers from Xinjiang as none were working at the factory when we conducted our visit,” he said.']",The Communist Party wants to remold Xinjiang’s minorities into loyal blue-collar workers to supply Chinese factories with cheap labor.
Sudan Sentences 29 Intelligence Officers to Death for Teacher’s Killing,2019-12-30,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — A Sudanese court on Monday sentenced to death 29 members of the national intelligence service for the torture and killing of a teacher, the latest in a series of convictions and investigations this month targeting the government of the deposed president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir.  The court sentenced the men in the killing of Ahmed al-Kheir, a teacher who died in custody in February during mass protests against Mr. al-Bashir’s rule. Mr. al-Kheir, 36, was arrested in January from his home in Khashm el-Girba, in the eastern state of Kassala, on allegations that he had helped to organize the protests, according to news reports. Following his death, family members told Reuters that Mr. al-Kheir’s body had bruises showing that he was beaten while in detention.  Dozens of security officers filled the court on Monday as the judge read the charges against the accused, who were seated in a dock surrounded by metal bars. As the ruling proceeded, some of the defendants repeatedly yelled, “Monsters!” Mr. al-Kheir’s death became a focus of demonstrators’ outrage early this year, as they demanded an end to the autocratic rule of Mr. al-Bashir and his allies, a tenure that was marked by corruption and brutality.  Outside the court in Omdurman, the country’s second-most populous city, a large crowd gathered, many of them carrying the Sudanese flag and holding pictures of Mr. al-Kheir.  Itimad al-Mujamar, a representative of the Sudanese teacher’s union, said at a news conference on Monday that the convictions were “a win for justice.”  The ruling, he said, “sends a message to the other martyrs of the revolution and their families that we are intent on getting our lost rights back.” The Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella group of unions that steered the protests against Mr. al-Bashir, said they hoped the family and students of Mr. al-Kheir would find “some solace in this ruling.” The verdict came weeks after another court convicted Mr. al-Bashir, 75, of money laundering, and sentenced him to two years in a rehabilitation facility, citing his age. Mr. al-Bashir ruled Sudan for almost three decades but was ousted in April after months of protests precipitated by high bread prices persuaded military commanders to turn against him.  In August, Sudan’s generals and protest leaders formed an 11-member sovereign council to govern the country for three years, until elections can be held. Abdalla Hamdok, an economist, is currently serving as prime minister, while Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan leads the sovereign council. In October, the government appointed two independent judges after protesters demanded that previous appointees be removed before prosecutions went ahead against members of the old leadership and those responsible for crackdowns against anti-Bashir protests. This month, one of the new appointees, the Sudanese attorney general Taj al-Sir al-Hibir, said the government would open investigations into the crimes committed in the western region of Darfur during Mr. al-Bashir’s rule.  About 300,000 people were killed in the conflict there, and 2.7 million were forced from their homes, according to the United Nations. Mr. al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court over his role in the atrocities in Darfur.  Mr. al-Bashir could also face a slew of other charges related to accusations that he ordered the killing of pro-democracy protesters earlier this year and his role in the coup that brought him to power in 1989. In looking into crimes committed under Mr. al-Bashir, the transitional government’s law enforcement and judicial systems want to be seen as responsive to the protesters’ demands for justice, said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow with the think tank Atlantic Council. But while efforts to hold security officials responsible are “welcome progress,” Mr. Hudson said, “there is also a degree of score-settling and purging going on within the intelligence services.” Many officers remain loyal to former intelligence chief Salah Gosh, who is being investigated by the current administration. He quit days after Mr. al-Bashir was ousted, and then left the country. Given that, Mr. Hudson said, it was important that “the arrests and trials be seen as credible in the eyes of the people and targeting those truly responsible for ordering and carrying out these crimes.”']","The ruling came just weeks after Omar al-Bashir, the ousted president, was convicted of money laundering and corruption."
‘A Slow-Motion Chernobyl’: How Lax Laws Turned a River Into a Disaster,2019-12-30,By Steve Fisher and Elisabeth Malkin,"['EL SALTO, Mexico — By the time the polluted Santiago River bursts over a waterfall on the outskirts of Guadalajara, in western Mexico, its stench seems to be everywhere: hovering over crops, seeping into homes, fouling the tap water. The river smells of industrial waste and sewage — a catastrophe years in the making, with far-ranging consequences. Activists say the chemicals streaming from factories have contributed to a toxic brew that has killed and sickened many along its banks. The environment minister recently called it an “environmental hell.”  “This town is a slow-motion Chernobyl,” said Enrique Enciso, whose house in El Salto is perched just a few blocks from the river, and whose family has fought for more than a decade to clean it up. The river is a powerful example of Mexico’s failure to protect its environment: A New York Times analysis of 15 years of efforts to clean up the Santiago found that attempts floundered in the face of legal loopholes, deficient funding and a lack of political will.  Now, Mexico has signed an expansive trade deal with the United States and Canada in which it made an explicit promise to conserve its environment — a provision that was central to winning approval from Democrats in the United States Congress. But The Times’s interviews with federal, state and local authorities and with families along the river showed that, without an overhaul of Mexico’s flawed legal framework and a change in the political conditions that allowed the Santiago to become little more than a channel for industrial runoff, Mexico is unlikely to be able to meet the terms of the trade deal. The Santiago River, which courses through the state of Jalisco, is a case study in the ways the government has proved unable to police the businesses in a major river basin.  The United Nations called it Mexico’s most polluted waterway. Farms and factories that help power Mexico’s economy — and that would be bound up in the terms of the new trade deal — dump illegal quantities of waste into it, and do so with little penalty. Factories are required to report and treat their own emissions, for instance — an exercise in good faith that officials admit does not work. Less than a third of the country’s industrial wastewater is treated, the director of the government agency in charge of Mexico’s rivers, the National Water Commission, or Conagua, said recently at a public event, citing 2017 figures. There are companies that do treat their wastewater, the director, Blanca Jiménez said. “But there are companies that don’t, even when they have the economic means. And there the state has to intervene.” But the state rarely acts. Conagua is responsible for regulating industrial emissions into rivers, but it has just one inspector for the entire state of Jalisco. And even when the agency does respond, the penalties it can impose are too low to be a deterrent. In one example, according to documents obtained by The Times, the Texas-based Celanese Corporation acknowledged to Conagua that it had discharged illegal amounts of chemical waste 13 times during the summer of 2015, including almost 500 kilograms of hydrochloric acid, a corrosive compound. The company blamed heavy rains for the overflow, but Conagua issued a $4,300 fine.  The federal environmental enforcement agency also has the authority to inspect industrial wastewater — but rarely does so. In the state of Jalisco, inspectors visited 73 companies in the five years leading up to 2018 to check water emissions. There are an estimated 10,000 companies — from family-owned workshops to state-owned energy companies and large multinationals — operating in the Santiago River basin in Jalisco. Mexican officials have known the Santiago is heavily polluted for many years. In 2008, an 8-year-old boy, Miguel Ángel López Rocha, fell into a tributary of the Santiago. He scrambled out, but by dinnertime he was convulsing and vomiting. He died days later, of arsenic poisoning caused by the river, according to the National Human Rights Commission. His death turned national attention to the river’s pollution, and the state commissioned a study. That 2011 report, by the Mexican Institute for Water Technology, found that the river contained high levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, cyanide, mercury and nickel. Two years later, a commission set up under the first North American trade agreement studied pollution in the Santiago and the adjoining Lake Chapala at the request of local communities. It found monitoring and enforcement failures as well as little evidence of an “alleged implementation of an ecological restoration plan” for the region. But that trade deal, known as Nafta, did not allow for any penalties.  In 2017, the state of Jalisco, together with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, studied the river again and found its condition to be “critical,” with levels of many pollutants that repeatedly violated the permitted limits. “The Santiago River is, for me, one of the most shameful, most terrible stories that Jalisco and Mexico have,” said the state governor, Enrique Alfaro. Just after taking office a year ago, Mr. Alfaro visited the bridge over the waterfall that has become the symbol of the river’s pollution, and promised to tackle the problem — a bold pledge, given that both his power and his resources are limited. Mexico’s regulations are antiquated and riddled with loopholes.  Mexico overhauled its environmental regulations and set up new national agencies after the original 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement brought international attention to its lax standards.  But that impulse quickly dissipated as Mexico worked to attract investment, and a quarter-century later, Mexican regulations generally allow factories to dump more contaminants into the water and the air than is allowed in the United States.  There is no limit to the number of factories allowed to discharge waste into a river. Regulations do not include some organic chemicals, such as pesticides, and many heavy metals, according to Elizabeth Southerland, a former water expert at the Environmental Protection Agency who reviewed the Mexican regulations. The limited rules, she added, are “totally inadequate to protect aquatic life and human health.” The agencies in charge of enforcing the law have few resources and little political support, making them no match for the country’s expanding industry and growing population. A proposed overhaul of wastewater limits has stalled, blocked by lobbying from industry, according to Luis Esparza, an environmental lawyer, and Conagua officials. “The law is made to normalize polluting activities to give them the seal of approval legally,” said Cindy McCulligh, an environmental expert at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas who studies the causes of the Santiago’s pollution. “Then you have the total absence of inspections, so that generates an environment of even greater impunity.” When Mr. Alfaro, the governor, asked federal officials for help, he was told there was not a single peso available. The federal budget for the environment has fallen by more than half of what it was five years ago.  With no help from the federal government, Mr. Alfaro signed an agreement with local factories in August in which the companies made a voluntary pledge to play by the rules. The government “does not have the capacity to ensure that we all follow the law,” said Rubén Masayi González, the coordinator of the Council of Jalisco Industry Chambers at the time. Municipal authorities, in theory, also have the power to check polluters: They have control over zoning and emissions into the municipal sewage system. But in practice, with threadbare budgets and little technical expertise, they are the weakest link in enforcing regulations. That is what Carlos Maldonado, a former wheat farmer, found out when he ran for mayor of Poncitlán, a largely rural municipality upstream from where the river loops around Guadalajara. Over decades, he had seen mounds of foam form in the irrigation channels carrying river water to his crops. Then the fish disappeared from the river and the land became barren. During his first days in office, in 2010, he decided to audit local companies. “When people voted for me they did not vote for someone who was going to turn a blind eye,” Mr. Maldonado said. He asked a chemical plant owned by Celanese, a major employer in Poncitlán, for a report of its emissions. It had operated the plant in Jalisco since the 1940s, but shut it down at the end of October, citing market conditions. Celanese told Mr. Maldonado that the request was beyond his authority, he said. So he withheld the company’s yearly operating license as leverage. When the mayor would not back down, Celanese contacted the state governor. And after a meeting among state and local officials with lawyers for Celanese, Mr. Maldonado relented. W. Travis Jacobsen, a spokesman for Celanese, said that the mayor had no reason to withhold any licenses or permits because the company was never cited for any wrongdoing. The former Conagua director for the Santiago River Basin, José Chedid Abraham, said laws on pollution enforcement were flawed. “Everybody enforces the part that corresponds to them,” he said. “And that leaves gaps where polluters can maneuver so that they can continue to pollute.” That could change under the new trade deal, said Gustavo Alanís, the director of the Mexican Center for Environmental Law, one of Mexico’s leading environmental organizations. Tucked into the fine print of the law that the United States Congress wrote to approve the deal is a measure that would require Mexico to correct failures in enforcement or face possible penalties. “This could be an important signal,” Mr. Alanís said, adding that the measure put “baby teeth” in the agreement. “We have always wanted there to be enforcement.” But after years of activism, the communities living along the river have little hope of change. The Enciso family have been pressing for government action more than a decade. In that time, they have seen neighbors suffering from kidney disease, respiratory illnesses, and skin rashes. Others developed cancer, said the family, and many believed the river was to blame. “Now we realize the size of the monster,” said Mr. Enciso’s wife, Graciela González, 58.  Mr. Enciso added: “The government is walking hand in hand with the guilty.”']",A look at 15 years of attempts to clean up Mexico’s most polluted waterway revealed that the country has neither the means nor the laws to preserve its environment. 
The U.N. Tried to Save Hospitals in Syria. It Didn’t Work.,2019-12-29,By Evan Hill and Whitney Hurst,"['A United Nations system to prevent attacks on hospitals and other humanitarian sites in insurgent-held areas of Syria has been ignored by Russian and Syrian forces and marred by internal errors, a New York Times investigation has found. The repeated bombing and shelling of these sites has led relief group leaders to openly criticize the United Nations over the system, which is meant to provide warring parties with the precise locations of humanitarian sites that under international law are exempt from attack. Some of these groups have described the system of identifying and sharing sites, known as the “humanitarian deconfliction mechanism,” as effectively useless. A new offensive by Syrian and Russian forces that began in late December has devastated what remains of several towns in northwestern Syria and caused tens of thousands of civilians to flee. United Nations officials only recently created a unit to verify locations provided by relief groups that managed the exempt sites, some of which had been submitted incorrectly, The Times found. Such instances of misinformation give credibility to Russian criticisms that the system cannot be trusted and is vulnerable to misuse. “The level and scale of attacks has not really decreased,” said Dr. Mufaddal Hamadeh, the president of the Syrian American Medical Society, which supports more than 40 hospitals and other sites in insurgent-held areas of northwestern Syria. “We can say categorically that in terms of accountability, in terms of deterrence, that doesn’t work.” The Times compiled a list of 182 no-strike sites by using data provided by five relief groups and compiling public statements from others. Of those facilities, 27 were damaged by Russian or Syrian attacks since April. All were hospitals or clinics. Such a list is likely to represent only a small portion of the exempt sites struck during the Syrian war, now almost nine years old. Under international law, intentionally or recklessly bombing hospitals is a war crime. The deconfliction system works by sharing the location of humanitarian sites with Russian, Turkish and United States-led coalition forces operating in Syria, on the understanding that they will not target those sites. The system is voluntary, but relief groups said they felt intense pressure from donors and United Nations officials to participate. The groups give locations of their own choosing to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the agency that runs the system. A document prepared by the agency warned that participation in the system “does not guarantee” the safety of the sites or their personnel. The document also stated that the United Nations would not verify information provided by participating groups. The system also does not require the Russians, Turks or Americans to acknowledge receipt of no-strike locations. Whether such an arrangement can ever be successful in the brutal Syria conflict, where laws of war are disregarded on a daily basis, is an open question. The forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, alongside their Russian allies, have acted as if the deconfliction system does not exist. Local journalists and relief groups have recorded at least 69 attacks on no-strike sites since the Russian military intervention to help Mr. Assad began in October 2015, all but a few of them most likely committed by Russian or Syrian forces. Jan Egeland, a Norwegian diplomat who was an adviser to the United Nations on Syria from 2015 to 2018, said the United Nations had failed to impose sufficient repercussions on those responsible. “In general, deconfliction can work if there is a very loud, very noisy, very reliable investigation follow-up, accountability-oriented mechanism around it,” Mr. Egeland said, “so that the men who sit with their finger on the trigger understand there will be consequences if they don’t check the list or if they even deliberately target deconflicted places.” But Russia has repeatedly blocked action in the United Nations Security Council meant to strengthen accountability and humanitarian access in the Syria war, casting 14 vetoes since the conflict began, including for a resolution that would have referred Syria to the International Criminal Court. Russia’s latest veto, on Dec. 20, could halt deliveries of humanitarian aid into Syria from Turkey and Iraq starting next month. In August, the United Nations Secretary General António Guterres established a board of inquiry to investigate strikes on deconflicted sites, as well as other locations supported by the United Nations. But the investigators are currently planning to examine only seven of the dozens of attacks since April, and may not identify the perpetrators or even make their report public, a limited scope that has further angered humanitarian groups. Growing frustration over the failure of the deconfliction system led to a June meeting between an association of relief groups and Trond Jensen, a top United Nations humanitarian official in Turkey who has since moved to a new position in Gaza. A summary of the meeting that was sent to participants afterward by Mr. Jensen and that was obtained by The Times acknowledged “a huge trust deficit in the process and with those who manage it.” Relief groups felt they were putting the lives of their colleagues and other civilians at risk by participating, Mr. Jensen’s summary said. Fadi al-Dairi, chairman of the association that met with Mr. Jensen, said that the United Nations and humanitarian groups had acted in “good faith” when they began using the system but that “we’ve not achieved anything.” “There is a sense of frustration, lack of trust in everyone,” said Mr. al-Dairi, who is a co-founder of Hand in Hand for Aid and Development, which supports 53 deconflicted sites in Syria. Though the deconfliction system has existed for years, Mr. al-Dairi and others involved in relief efforts said that the United Nations humanitarian agency had only recently hired dedicated deconfliction staff in southern Turkey and Amman, Jordan, to verify locations of deconflicted sites so that false information was not sent to the warring parties. Previously, United Nations officials had told the groups that they did not have the capacity to hire more people, Mr. al-Dairi said. “Some NGOs might lack the skills when it comes to reporting the coordinates,” Mr. al-Dairi said of the groups, “but it’s up to the U.N. to confirm it.”  “It is a matter of life and death,” he added, “so that’s why they should have been more proactive, like they are now.” United Nations humanitarian officials privately told The Times that some relief groups had previously submitted incorrect locations and that, although rare, in a few cases misinformation had been shared with Russia, Turkey and the American-led coalition. The United Nations humanitarian agency has taken steps to improve the system in recent months, including the creation of a “centralized entity” to run it, according to Zoe Paxton, a spokeswoman for the agency. It also is now giving participant organizations a second opportunity to confirm submitted locations. United Nations officials emphasize that under international law, the warring parties are responsible for verifying targets and minimizing harm. Mr. Assad’s government, which has effectively criminalized the providing of health care in opposition-held areas, has repeatedly bombed humanitarian sites. Russian officials claim their Air Force carries out only precision strikes on “accurately researched targets,” and they have attacked the integrity of the deconfliction system. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, said at a news conference in September that Russian military reconnaissance had discovered “lots of instances of deliberate disinformation” in the system.  One site listed as a hospital was actually being used to store firearms, Mr. Nebenzia claimed, while other sites had been submitted with coordinates sometimes up to 10 kilometers from their real locations. “To get you a sense of an ‘iceberg’ size here, I will just say that only in July alone we were provided with 12 false coordinates,” he said. “And that is only about what we had capacity and time to check.” While some of Mr. Nebenzia’s claims were shown to be false, at least three relief groups did submit incorrect coordinates to the United Nations on various occasions, The Times found. While investigating an airstrike in November, The Times discovered that a relief group had provided coordinates for its health center that were around 240 meters away. When another hospital was bombed in May, The Times found that the coordinates submitted by its supporting organization pointed to an unrelated structure around 765 meters north. After questions from The Times prompted the organization to review its deconfliction list, a staff member discovered that it had provided the United Nations with incorrect locations for 14 of its 19 deconflicted sites. The original locations had been logged by a pharmacist. The list had been with the United Nations humanitarian agency for eight months, and no one had contacted the organization to correct the locations, a member of the organization’s staff said. Mr. al-Dairi and others involved in relief work said they assumed Russian and Syrian forces could find and target hospitals and other humanitarian sites without using the information shared by the United Nations. But they said they felt pressured to join the deconfliction system and had to convince skeptical Syrian doctors and aid workers to let them share their locations, knowing the information would go to the Russians and almost assuredly their Syrian government allies. Dr. Munzer al-Khalil, the head of the Idlib Health Directorate, which oversees health care in Syria’s last opposition-held province, said many international donors would not support medical facilities unless they joined the U.N.’s deconfliction system. “Therefore, we did not have much of an option,” Dr. al-Khalil said. “We paid a price by sharing the coordinates of the medical facilities with the United Nations. And what we got lately, frankly, was more bombing of medical facilities, and more precise bombing, and more destructive than before.” Relief group leaders said that their only remaining hope was that adding their sites to the deconfliction list had left Russia and the Syrian government with no deniability — important for theoretical war crimes trials decades in the future. “We truly believe the world has abandoned us,” Dr. al-Khalil said.

"In Indonesia, Outlaw Gold Miners Poison Themselves to Survive",2019-12-30,By Richard C. Paddock and Adam Dean,"['TALIWANG, Indonesia — The wildcat miner had something to prove: Processing gold ore with liquid mercury was perfectly safe. So he drank some of the toxic chemical, choosing the promises of gold fever over the pain of mercury poisoning.  “I have no worry about mercury,” bragged the fast-talking Syarafuddin Iskandar, 58. “I drank it. We gave it to the cows and the buffalos. They drank it. Nothing happened. There’s no problem.” His stunt has made him famous in the gold fields of Sumbawa, an Indonesian island 100 miles east of Bali where makeshift mining camps dot the jungle hills. But it also illustrated the stark choice the illegal miners here face. In order to earn a living they effectively poison themselves, their communities and the environment by using mercury, an outlawed but popular way to extract gold from ore.  For decades, Mr. Syarafuddin and thousands of small-scale miners like him have worked illegally in West Sumbawa on land the government leases to large mining companies. The outlaw miners pay nothing for rights to the land but reap as much as $6 million a month in gold.  About one million small-scale gold miners operate across Indonesia, the world’s largest island nation, and the outlaw industry presents a vexing paradox for the country.  The use of mercury in the wildcat camps results in devastating effects on health and the environment. The heavy metal is well known as a slow-acting poison that seeps into the food chain, causing birth defects, neurological disorders and death. But because the mines are a short-term boon to the economy — employing people who might otherwise live in crushing poverty — the government is reluctant to shut them down. The competing interests of the local people, the government, environmentalists and large mining companies that control land where wildcat miners operate are now coming to a head in West Sumbawa. This time a large mining company is taking steps, which it says are meant to protect the environment.  This year, officers from a feared Police Mobile Brigade Corps, armed with assault rifles, climbed through dense jungle to shut down the mountaintop camps of dozens of outlaw miners. The miners had squatted there for years, using mercury that poisoned the soil and a nearby stream. The site was previously controlled by Newmont Goldcorp, an American company and one of the largest mining businesses in the world. The police ordered the miners to dismantle their camps, cut up their equipment with a chain saw and block the mine entrances with debris. The wildcatters seethed with anger as the miners were forced to destroyed their operations. “We are crushed that they are closing this mine because we have no other way to make a living,” said one outlaw mine operator, Zaenal Abidin, who had employed two dozen men to work his claim.  The environmental group Nexus3 Foundation estimates that 850 gold mining sites have become mercury contaminated hot spots and that half a million people suffer from mercury poisoning nationwide. The rare police crackdown was prompted by the mining company, PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara. Amman Mineral acquired the vast land concession and huge Batu Hijau open-pit copper mine from Newmont in 2016 during a push by the government to assert national control over mineral resources. With a pipeline that dumped massive amounts of mine waste into the sea, Newmont gained a reputation for damaging the environment.  Closing the unauthorized mines is part of a campaign by Amman Mineral to stop illegal mining and uncontrolled mercury use on the former Newmont concession and another, known as Indotan, that it oversees 20 miles north. “Initially, we thought of it as just illegal pillaging of resources,” said Amman Mineral’s director, Alexander Ramlie. “But when we looked deeper at it, we realized it is a more serious social problem. They are creating an environmental disaster.” The vast majority of West Sumbawa’s 7,000 wildcat miners are on the Indotan site, which Amman Mineral’s partners recently took over in a separate deal. Much of the mining takes place in the hills above Lake Taliwang, a shallow lake northeast of Taliwang town. A 2016 study found that so much of the miners’ mercury reached the lake that eating just one lake fish could exceed a person’s mercury allowance for a week. A second study that surveyed miners found that many had high mercury levels and some were experiencing early symptoms of mercury poisoning, such as finger tremors and sleep disturbances. But in the absence of government warnings or enforcement of the ban on mercury use, it is easy for miners to dismiss the idea that it is hazardous. Wildcat miners have been operating for decades on the Indotan concession, where they have established permanent communities and an industrial-scale village for processing ore. The miners operate openly without fear that the police will interfere. On one road, they have set up a checkpoint to control access to their diggings. Some government, police and military officials also are said to profit from the illicit gold trade, which is estimated at $5 billion a year. The miners will fight any attempt to drive them off the land without providing other jobs, said Anton, a Sumbawa native who owns mines and mills. Like many Indonesians, he uses one name. Wearing flashy 22-karat necklaces made from gold his mine produced, he questions why big companies like Newmont and Amman Mineral get lucrative mining concessions while he and his fellow miners are branded as illegal. “Why do you allow the outsiders to operate while we, the locals, are forbidden from doing the work?” he asked. The mine bosses and their workers have good reason not to give ground. Miners in the Taliwang region reported making an average of 15 times more from gold mining than from other occupations, according to the survey of 55 miners. Officials said the illegal operations are the second-largest contributor to the economy of West Sumbawa Regency, after Amman Mineral’s legal operation. The outlaw miners are so well entrenched that the head of their 5,000-member association, Mustafa, served for years as deputy leader of the local parliament. Amman Mineral’s main focus is finding and developing rich copper deposits. But gold is commonly found along with copper and Mr. Ramlie, the company director, fears that word of a big discovery could incite another gold rush to West Sumbawa. “We can see that if we don’t contain this problem now and it is made known that Sumbawa has a lot of easily extractable gold deposits, this island could be crawling with all sorts of illegal miners and very pervasive use of mercury,” he said. “That will be a disaster.” But equally disastrous, Mr. Ramlie said, would be if the police or troops confronted miners in large numbers. “Beyond a certain scale, it’s going to be like civil war to try to contain them,” he said. Finding alternate employment for the miners is a huge challenge in a country where 26 million people — 10 percent of the population — live in poverty. Officials said they were unsure how to proceed. Persuading miners not to use mercury has largely been unsuccessful. “This is a big dilemma,” said the West Sumbawa regent, H. W. Musyafirin. “If we stop them, we are faced with the economic problem of how to feed them.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.']","One large mining company is trying to shut illegal operations, which use mercury.

American Airstrikes Rally Iraqis Against U.S.,2019-12-30,By Alissa J. Rubin and Ben Hubbard,"['Iraq has been caught for years in a tug of war between its two most powerful patrons, the United States and Iran. In recent months, public opinion began to tilt against Iran, with street protests demanding an end to Tehran’s pervasive influence. But American airstrikes that killed two dozen members of an Iranian-backed militia over the weekend have now made Washington the focus of public hostility, reducing the heat on Tehran and its proxies. Iraqi leaders accused the United States on Monday of violating Iraq’s sovereignty and expressed fear that increasing tensions between the United States and Iran could escalate into a proxy war on Iraqi soil. Even the tenor of the street protests has shifted, as anti-Iranian slogans have given way to anti-American ones. Demonstrators and others attacked what they deemed to be America’s disproportionate response — the killing of 24 militiamen on Sunday in retaliation for the death of an American contractor on Friday.  By day’s end there were calls to end the “American occupation” and demands for the American military to leave Iraq.  For Iran, the reversal comes at an opportune moment, as it has faced pushback around the region and unrest and economic distress at home. The American airstrikes on the militia’s bases in Iraq and Syria on Sunday wounded 50 people in addition to those killed, the militia, Kataib Hezbollah, said Monday. The United States said the strikes were a reprisal for the more than 30 rockets Kataib Hezbollah launched against an Iraqi military base near Kirkuk on Friday, killing the American contractor and wounding four American and two Iraqi servicemen.  “What we did is take a decisive response that makes clear what President Trump has said for months and months and months,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday, “which is that we will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy.” Despite the American justification, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called the airstrikes “a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and a dangerous escalation and threat to the security of Iraq and the region.” Iraq’s chief Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the American attack and warned that the government must “ensure that Iraq does not become a field for settling regional and international scores.” Even if the American attack was “retaliation for illegal actions,” he said, the Iraqi authorities should deal with them, not the Americans. Iraq’s Iranian-backed militias have increasingly posed a problem for both Iraq and the United States. The militias arose to help defeat the Islamic State, a battle they effectively fought on the same side as the Americans. They now represent a powerful faction in Iraq, both militarily and politically, controlling a large bloc in Parliament. While they are technically under the supervision of the Iraqi security forces, some have strong ties to Iran and operate with significant independence. As the Trump administration has imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, the militias have increasingly struck at American targets. An American official said Sunday that the militias had carried out 11 attacks over the past two months on Iraqi bases and facilities housing American contractors and service members. The group the United States accused of carrying out the deadly attack on Friday, Kataib Hezbollah, denied responsibility for it, a spokesman, Mohammed Muhi, said Monday. And while the militia is closely tied to Iran, many Iraqis see it primarily as an Iraqi force and were angered by an attack on it by an outside power. “We are talking about a foreign force attacking an Iraqi force,” said Maria Fantappie, the senior adviser on Iraq for the International Crisis Group.  While there has been some criticism of the militias’ attacks on Iraqi bases where Americans are stationed, most objections are now being leveled at the United States. The populist cleric Moktada al-Sadr, for instance, urged the militias to abandon “irresponsible actions,” saying he would work with them to use legal and political means to kick out the Americans. Analysts also said the scale of the American attack — on five sites in two countries with two dozen people killed — made it likely that Kataib Hezbollah would feel compelled to respond and could rally anti-Americanism. “Is that deterrence, or is this really risking the whole of the U.S. presence in Iraq?” asked Emma Sky, a senior fellow at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. The United States may have been trying to send a message that killing Americans was a red line not to be crossed, said Ranj Alaaldin, director of the Proxy Wars Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Doha, Qatar. But the toll of its attack was likely to yield “more intense and expanded operations” against Americans. “What the U.S. intended and what the U.S. will get could be two very different things,” he said. The militia, Kataib Hezbollah, which is separate from the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, vowed unspecified “retaliation,” and Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Seyed Abbas Mousavi, said the United States “must accept full responsibility for the consequences of this illegal action.” How Iran may respond is difficult to predict. If it chooses to escalate, it or its proxies could strike an array of American targets in Iraq, where there are troops on the ground and other Americans living and working. The United States accused Iran this month of exploiting the chaos in Iraq to build up a hidden arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles there. Iran could also work with its partners to attack American allies elsewhere in the region as it has tried to do in the past. Such targets have included Saudi Arabia, Israel and ships crossing the Persian Gulf. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seized a ship in the Persian Gulf on Monday, the official IRNA news agency reported. The report did not say which country the ship belonged to. Over the last several months, Iranian-backed militias have repeatedly poked at the Americans in Iraq, firing rockets into the Green Zone that were apparently aimed at the United States Embassy. The militias have also hit several Iraqi bases where Americans were billeted, including in Gayara, just south of Mosul, and in western Iraq near Al Asad Air Base.  “I think Iran was reading that Trump really wants out of the region and is not willing to respond militarily,” Ms. Sky said. So the Iranians have been “trying to figure out how far they could go.” Until Friday, the militias had never killed an American.  A senior administration official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity according to White House rules, said that the airstrikes were intended to restore deterrence. The official said that Iran’s policy has been to conduct deniable attacks, a fiction that the United States would no longer allow. The Trump administration placed economic sanctions on three militia leaders this month, including the leader of Kataib Hezbollah. The United States accused those militias of participating in an unprovoked attack on anti-government protesters that killed 15 people. The American strikes in Iraq hit near a town on the Syrian border. The strikes in Syria were in the country’s eastern desert, where Iran supports forces fighting on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war. Analysts said that the American message was clear, but that it may have been overshadowed by the high death toll. “That puts the ball back in Iran’s court,” said Mr. Alaaldin of Brookings. “But make no mistake, that ball will, for now, be played in Iraq’s political arena, where the United States is much weaker. Iran has a strategic game plan on the ground in Iraq aimed at protecting and enhancing its influence in Iraq. The Americans do not.” Farnaz Fassihi, Falih Hassan and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.']",Iraqi leaders say the United States violated Iraqi sovereignty with attacks that killed 24 people in retaliation for the death of an American contractor.
"With Prisoner Swap, Ukraine’s President Inches Toward Peace With Separatists",2019-12-29,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners on Sunday with Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east, the latest sign of a tenuous thaw in relations between Ukraine and Russia. The trade was seen as a success for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has vowed to free all detainees and negotiate a settlement to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. But it came at a high price: to secure its prisoners, Ukraine freed riot police officers who had been accused of shooting protesters during the country’s revolution in 2014, a widely criticized move.  Mr. Zelensky negotiated the swap with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this month at peace talks in Paris that otherwise made little headway in resolving the five-year war. The sides exchanged soldiers, activists and people accused of espionage, some of whom had been languishing in jails for years. It was in an effort last summer to win American support for such diplomacy that Mr. Zelensky sought a White House meeting with President Trump, who in exchange asked for investigations that could help discredit his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The House of Representatives impeached Mr. Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. With the United States — Ukraine’s principal ally — distracted by impeachment proceedings, Mr. Zelensky entered the settlement talks with Russia with a weakened hand. But Mr. Zelensky, who won an election in April on a promise to end the war, has nonetheless been inching toward more stable relations with Russia. Mr. Putin, eager to shake Western resolve on economic sanctions, has accommodated with confidence-building steps, like the prisoner swap. The exchange was initially to be an all-for-all exchange of prisoners, but negotiations unraveled once the lists of detainees were presented. Some prisoners held by Ukraine declined to take part in a trade that would have sent them to live in the isolated, repressive separatist enclaves in the east known as the people’s republics, preferring to serve out their sentences in Ukraine instead. Ukrainian news media reported that 22 people declined to be traded. In response, the pro-Russia side withheld captives. Those who were released crossed a road between the front lines that was swathed in mist on Sunday. Soldiers stood guard, a video released by the Ukrainian government showed. In this swap, as in previous exchanges, detainees became bargaining chips not only to free captives but also to serve strategic goals in the broader conflict. The pro-Russian side requested the release of five Ukrainian riot police officers held for reasons unrelated to the war — they were accused of 48 counts of murder over shootings on Independence Square in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, during mass protests that toppled a pro-Russia president in 2014.  The shootings on the square became a searing moment in Ukraine’s post-Communist history, and families of the victims and Ukrainian nationalists had clamored for years for court convictions that would also become indictments of Russia’s influence in Ukraine. The men were charged but never convicted, and Sunday’s trade seemingly put them out of reach of justice. Mr. Zelensky’s policy of rapprochement with Russia has brought a resumption of peace talks, two prisoner releases and an agreement for Russia to ship natural gas to Europe through Ukrainian pipelines, while prompting protests against policies that critics see as caving to Russian demands.']","Among those traded were riot police officers accused of killing protesters during mass demonstrations in the capital, Kyiv, in 2014.

"Protesters Attack U.S. Embassy in Iraq, Chanting ‘Death to America’",2019-12-31,"By Falih Hassan, Ben Hubbard and Alissa J. Rubin","['BAGHDAD — Protesters broke into the heavily guarded compound of the United States Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday and set fires inside in anger over American airstrikes that killed 24 members of an Iranian-backed militia over the weekend. The men did not enter the main embassy buildings and later withdrew from the compound, joining thousands of protesters and militia fighters outside chanting “Death to America,” throwing rocks, covering the walls with graffiti and demanding that the United States withdraw its forces from Iraq. The situation remained combustible, with the crowd vowing to camp indefinitely outside the sprawling compound, the world’s largest embassy. Their ability to storm the most heavily guarded zone in Baghdad suggested that they had received at least tacit permission from Iraqi security officials sympathetic to their demands. President Trump, faced with scenes of unfolding chaos at an American embassy, lashed out against Iran, which he blamed for the protests. “Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,” he said in a tweet. “They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!” [Latest: U.S. embassy in Baghdad is hit by rocket fire.] He also spoke with Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi about the need to protect Americans and American facilities. Speaking with reporters in an impromptu exchange Tuesday night at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Mr. Trump said he thought his administration had handled the situation in Iraq “very well.” Asked about the possibility of war, Mr. Trump said, “I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran,” adding, “I want to have peace, I like peace. And Iran should want peace more than anybody.” Roughly 750 additional American troops will deploy to the region immediately, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said late Tuesday. “This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities,” he said. The troops are likely to deploy to Kuwait. Mr. Trump has long called for an end to American conflicts in the Middle East, but has been reluctant to pull troops from the region despite his remarks on the campaign trail. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke by telephone with Mr. Abdul Mahdi and President Barham Salih in separate calls, and “made clear the United States will protect and defend its people,” according to a summary of the call from the State Department. It said that the Iraqi leaders “assured the secretary that they took seriously their responsibility” to safeguard American officials and property. The State Department said that American personnel were safe and that there were no plans to evacuate the embassy. The ambassador, Matt Tueller, had been traveling and was not at the embassy when it was breached on Tuesday. The American airstrikes on Sunday have resulted in the most serious political crisis in years for the United States in Iraq, stoking anti-Americanism and handing an advantage to Iran in its competition for influence in the country. The airstrikes targeted an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, Kataib Hezbollah, which the United States accused of carrying out a missile attack on an Iraqi military base that killed an American contractor and wounded American and Iraqi service members. A spokesman for the militia denied involvement in the attack. But the size of the American response — five strikes in Iraq and Syria that killed two dozen fighters and wounded dozens of others — prompted condemnation from across the political spectrum in Iraq, and accusations that the United States had violated Iraqi sovereignty. It also drew sharp criticism and serious threats of reprisals from Iraq’s Iranian-backed militias.  The fact that the Iraqi government permitted militia members to enter the fortified Green Zone on Tuesday, allowing the protest to happen, demonstrated Iran’s powerful influence as well as the government’s difficulty in controlling the militias. But the Iraqi leadership’s success in averting a deeper incursion into the embassy compound and preventing any confrontation with American personnel suggested that the government may have intended to allow the militias to vent their anger with minimal damage.    The United States military made a show of force in response to the turmoil, with helicopter gunships circling overhead. From inside the compound, loudspeakers warned the crowd outside to keep away from the walls. The Pentagon sent 120 Marine reinforcements to Baghdad from Kuwait, roughly the same number sent to the embassy in 2014, when the Islamic State was threatening Baghdad. The protest began Tuesday morning when thousands of militia members  gathered outside the Green Zone after prayer services for the fighters killed in the American strikes.  While few of them were armed, many were members of Kataib Hezbollah and other fighting groups that are technically overseen by the Iraqi military. Kataib Hezbollah is separate from the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, although both groups are backed by Iran and oppose the United States. When the protesters pushed toward the entrance to the Green Zone, a heavily guarded district of government offices and embassies in central Baghdad, the Iraqi security forces did not stop them.  Their accession to the protesters was a marked contrast to their treatment of the antigovernment protesters who have been demonstrating outside  the Green Zone for months. Those protesters were met with tear gas and bullets and have not been able to enter the Green Zone. Once at the embassy, the protesters on Tuesday used long poles to shatter security cameras. They covered the compound walls with anti-American graffiti and set a guardhouse on fire.  After breaking open a compound entrance, dozens of men entered and lit more fires while embassy security guards watched them from the embassy roof and fired tear gas. One group of protesters ended up separated from United States troops by only a pane of glass, according to a video shared on social media. It was not immediately clear how many Americans were inside the compound, but officials said they sheltered in place and were unhurt. The embassy complex, which opened in 2009 and cost an estimated $736 million to build, covers 104 acres, nearly as big as Vatican City, the world’s smallest country. By 2012, nearly 16,000 people worked there — most of them contractors, but also diplomats, military personnel, intelligence officers and aid workers — but the staff declined sharply over the following years. The embassy and an American consulate in Erbil, in northern Iraq, now have a combined staff of 486 people, with the majority in Baghdad.  The scenes there on Tuesday stirred memories of the seizure of two searing, politically consequential events in recent American history: the seizure of the embassy and 52 hostages in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and the assault on a United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. As a congressman, Mr. Pompeo became a political star among Republicans for blistering criticism of Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, over the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Mr. Trump also had Benghazi in mind, calling the Baghdad attack “the anti-Benghazi.” The protesters eventually left the Baghdad compound, but some climbed on top of adjacent buildings, where they planted militia flags. Iraqi police and military personnel eventually arrived at the scene, but they did not disperse the protesters. The Iraqi interior minister, Yassin al-Yasiri, said in an interview near the embassy that American attacks on an Iraqi militia had invited trouble. “These are the dangerous ramifications of this strike,” he said. “What happened today is the danger that we were afraid of, and that the Americans should have been afraid of.”  While the protesters carried the flags of Iraq and a range of militia groups, the most prominent was that of Kataib Hezbollah, the group targeted by the United States. A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, Mohammed Muhi, said his group intended to erect tents in the street in front of the United States Embassy for an opened-ended sit-in to pressure the Americans to leave Iraq. “We will not leave these tents until the embassy and the ambassador leave Iraq,” Mr. Muhi said. About 1,000 militia members  remained camped out in front of the embassy overnight.  The upheaval comes at a critical time for Iraq and for the United States’ role in the country. Mass protests in recent months against poor governance have weakened the government and underscored the criticism of Iraqis who feel that Iran has too much sway over the country’s politics. At the same time, Iran and the United States have been competing for political influence in the aftermath of the battle against the Islamic State, which once ruled large areas of Iraq. Iraqi militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, were formed in part to help fight the Islamic State in tandem with the national security forces, a battle that effectively put them on the side of the United States. They have since evolved into a powerful military and political force with a significant bloc in Parliament. Some of the militias are backed by Iran and use their power to help advance its interests in Iraq. The United States has about 5,200 troops in Iraq, down from a peak of 170,000 in 2007, in addition to a number of civilian contractors. The troops are stationed primarily at a base in Anbar Province, northwest of Baghdad, and at another in the Kurdish-controlled north of country. Their task is to train Iraqi security forces and help  prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State. After years of military and political investment in Iraq, the United States finds itself in a position where few powerful Iraqis are willing to stand up for it and its role in the country. Condemnation of the American airstrikes continued on Tuesday. Mr. Abdul Mahdi, the Iraqi prime minister, announced an official three-day mourning period for the men killed in the strikes, which he called an “outrageous attack.”  In a statement, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry reiterated the government’s condemnation of the strikes, but called on protesters to stay away from foreign embassies. “Any attack on foreign embassies or representatives will be firmly prevented by the security forces and punishable by law with the most severe penalties,” it said.

Putin Thanks Trump for Helping Russia Thwart Terrorist Attack,2019-12-29,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called President Trump on Sunday to thank him for a tip from American intelligence agencies that helped prevent a terrorist attack in Russia, the Kremlin said in a statement. The announcement offered no details about what information the United States had passed along. But the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the K.G.B., told Russian media it had detained two suspects preparing an attack on a crowded location in the northern city of St. Petersburg on New Year’s Eve. The two countries’ spy agencies typically view one another as adversaries, for example backing opposing sides in wars in Ukraine and, until earlier this year, in Syria. But when it comes to counterterrorism, they cooperate. Two years ago, Mr. Putin thanked Mr. Trump for information about another planned attack, also in St. Petersburg. And on Sunday, the Kremlin statement said Mr. Putin had again thanked Mr. Trump for “information transmitted through the channels of U.S. special services.” It said the two leaders had also discussed other “issues of mutual interest,” but did not spell them out. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Some of the terrorist groups tracked by the United States have also targeted Russia for years, among them the Islamic State. In 2015, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian airliner over Egypt, killing all 224 people aboard. Information has also flowed to the United States from Russia. In 2011, the Federal Security Service warned the F.B.I. that an immigrant from Russia living in Boston, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had associated with Islamist militants.

"Japan Loves Robots, but Getting Them to Do Human Work Isn’t Easy",2019-12-31,By Motoko Rich,"['ASAHIKAWA, Japan — Removing the tiny eyes that pockmark potatoes is dull, repetitive and time-consuming work — perfect, it would seem, for robots in a country where the population is declining and workers are increasingly in short supply. But it’s not so simple. When a food processing plant that makes potato salad and stews in Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, tried out a robot prototype designed to remove the potatoes’ eyes, the machine was not up to the task. The robot’s camera sensors were not sensitive enough to identify every eye. While human hands can roll a potato in every direction, the robot could rotate the vegetables on only one axis, and so failed to dig out many of the blemishes that are toxic to humans. Other perfectly good pieces were carved away. “Fundamentally, it could not do the work to the standard of humans,” said Akihito Shibayama, a factory manager at Yamazaki Group, which operates the plant in Asahikawa, a midsize city in the middle of Hokkaido where 30 workers process about 15 tons of potatoes a day. Japan, the world’s third largest economy, hopes that robots and other types of automation will help solve its demographic problems and impending labor shortage. That priority is reflected in a government blueprint, dubbed Society 5.0 and repeatedly emphasized by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  But businesses are struggling as some jobs that seem ripe for a robotic takeover prove remarkably difficult to outsource to a machine.  Robots can “perform simple tasks but not tasks that require judgment or the ability to evaluate a change in a situation,” said Toshiya Okuma, associate director of global strategy in the robot business division of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese developer of robotics that has long helped automate car factory assembly lines.  Looking to robots allows Japan to avoid hard choices about immigration, a delicate topic in a country reluctant to let in many outsiders. But it’s also a good cultural fit. Japan was an early adopter of robots, installing them in car factories starting in the 1970s. And some of the most beloved Japanese touchstones are robots.  Doraemon, a cuddly blue robot cat, stars in a comic book series and one of the country’s longest-running television shows. Astro Boy — or Tetsuwan Atomu in Japan — is a superhero in comics, television shows and movies, a kind of android equivalent of Pinocchio who fights for peace between robots and humans. Still, however hospitable Japanese businesses have been to robots, they have learned that robots able to perform somewhat sophisticated tasks cost much more than human workers. So at the factory in Asahikawa, where about 60 percent of the work is automated, many tasks still require the human touch. Workers peel pumpkins, for example, because some skin enhances the flavor of stew. A robot can’t determine just how much skin to shuck off. Other efforts to use robots or automation have hit snags, in programs ranging from self-driving buses to package-delivering drones or robots that comfort nursing home residents. A hotel staffed by androids in southern Japan ended up laying off some of its robots after customers complained that they were not as good at hospitality as people.  During a trial of self-driving buses in Oita City, also in southern Japan, one bus crashed into a curb, and officials realized that autonomous vehicles were not quite ready to cope with situations like traffic jams, jaywalkers or cars running red lights. For decades, Japan has been a leader in the use of robots. It is the world’s largest maker of industrial robots, and once led the globe in the number of robots per employee, said Gee Hee Hong, an economist specializing in Japan at the International Monetary Fund.  More recently, according to the International Federation of Robots, Singapore, South Korea and Germany have overtaken Japan in robots per worker. Unlike in the West, where employees often view automation as an existential threat, robots in Japan are generally portrayed as friendly forces. “Real world robots are regarded for the most part as benevolent and as a kind of symbol of an advanced, technologically savvy society,” said Jennifer Robertson, a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan and author of “Robo Sapiens Japanicus: Robots, Gender, Family and the Japanese Nation.” “I think the Japanese have been more innovative in thinking about applications of robotics in everyday life,” Ms. Robertson added. “But the hype got in the way of reality.”  Helping drive the interest in robots are concerns about the declining population in Japan, where births are at their lowest level since 1874. Already industries like manufacturing, caregiving, construction and agriculture are starting to run low of workers. In Japan, “instead of displacing workers, you are simply replacing workers,” said Todd Schneider, deputy division chief for the Japan division of the International Monetary Fund.  In Hokkaido, for example, where there are 1.2 job openings for every working-age resident, recent tests of autonomous driving trucks have not been perceived as a way to get rid of workers since they are already in short supply, prefectural officials say. Hokuren, a food company that processes beet sugar in northeastern Hokkaido, needs about 250 drivers during the peak fall season to transport 6,000 tons of beets a day from farms and storage facilities to its processing plant. Because of intense labor shortages this year, Hokuren tested autonomous vehicles manufactured by UD Trucks, a Volvo subsidiary based in Japan. But Hokuren officials say more tests are needed to ensure that vehicles can handle impediments like snowy or icy roads or changes in traffic lights. Genyou Imai, 48, the owner of a trucking company that regularly supplies drivers to Hokuren, acknowledged that he could not hire enough to meet his clients’ needs and that the autonomous vehicles might free his company up for other kinds of work. Although Parliament passed a bill last year to grant new visas to foreign workers to help cope with shortages, the government has consistently emphasized robots as more likely saviors.  “So where you would potentially have immigrants doing the jobs, you say, ‘Go make robots,’” said Selma Sabanovic, a professor of cognitive science at Indiana University who was a visiting scholar at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan. Business leaders have expressed doubts that foreigners could quickly solve Japan’s need for workers, in part because of societal resistance. “Japan has kind of a very pure-blood race,” said Noritsugu Uemura, an executive in charge of government and external relations for Mitsubishi Electric, a leading electronics manufacturer. “I think not only could it take 20 or 30 years, but it will take more like 40 or 50 years to integrate immigrants into Japan.”  “We can’t wait such a long time,” he added. Robots have helped the Kalm dairy outside Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital, trim from 15 workers to five. Now eight robots milk more than 400 cows three times a day as jazz piano music plays over loudspeakers in the barn. Each cow wears a sensor on its collar to signal the robots when it is time for milking. Automated gates corral the animals into stalls where the robots attach suction cups to the cows’ teats. Computers track the volume of milk streaming into tanks. Jin Kawaguchiya, chief executive of Kalm and a former banker who took over his wife’s family’s dairy business, said that to survive, it had to merge with several other local dairies that were also short of workers. “The best thing we could do,” Mr. Kawaguchiya said, “was make it into a humanless process.” Eimi Yamamitsu contributed reporting.

French Chef Loses Legal Battle Over a Lost Michelin Star,2019-12-31,By Aurelien Breeden and Elian Peltier,"['PARIS — A court in France ruled on Tuesday against a celebrity chef who sued the Michelin Guide after its reviewers stripped his restaurant of one of its treasured three stars.  The chef, Marc Veyrat, was outraged when La Maison des Bois, his restaurant in the Haute-Savoie area of France, which borders Switzerland and Italy, received a two-star rating in the 2019 guide, down from the top rating of three stars the previous year. Most chefs would be overjoyed at two Michelin stars, a status that can vault a restaurant from obscurity and dire financial straits to international acclaim and wealth. But Mr. Veyrat, 69, sued the guide in September in an effort to compel the dining guide to turn over reviewer notes that led to the downgrade, as well as the receipts from their meals.  The court in Nanterre, a northwestern suburb of Paris, ruled on Tuesday that Mr. Veyrat had offered no “proof showing the existence of any damage” caused by the guide’s demotion.  Mr. Veyrat said in a phone interview after the ruling was made public that he would “keep fighting against Michelin’s people.” “I don’t want to be part of the Michelin Guide anymore,” Mr. Veyrat said. “I don’t want to have to deal with these people. They are bad, bad, bad.” Richard Malka, a lawyer for the company that publishes the Michelin Guide, said the decision was a victory for freedom of expression. He has accused Mr. Veyrat of trying to restrict the liberty that the guide’s reviewers enjoy to dole out criticism or praise as they see fit. “Marc Veyrat complained about a review that is really good, since he has two stars, and he claimed that it was not normal,” Mr. Malka said. “But like any public personality, Mr. Veyrat is subject to critics and opinions.” Of the thousands of restaurants around France listed in the 2019 guide, only 27 received three stars. La Maison des Bois, which is coupled with a five-star hotel, has stunning views of the Alps, including Mont Blanc. Mr. Veyrat has said he mostly uses local products for the meals, which are available in menus at €295 and €395, or about $330 and $440. In 2018, the Michelin Guide awarded the restaurant three stars for the first time. It slipped back to two stars in the 2019 guide. Mr. Veyrat, who hails from the Haute-Savoie area, said he felt “insulted” at being downgraded. In July, he asked the guide to strip his restaurant of its two other stars, arguing that the demotion had given him a nervous breakdown.  Officials from the guide met with the chef to explain the decision, but Gwendal Poullenec, the international head of the Michelin Guides, said that Mr. Veyrat’s restaurant could not be removed entirely. “The stars from the Michelin Guide do not belong to the chefs,” Mr. Poullenec said in an interview with Le Monde in July. “It is not up to them to give them up.”  On Tuesday, Mr. Veyrat, who is known for his black shepherd’s hat and outspokenness, said the Michelin reviewers were ignorant about Savoie cuisine and compared them to “professors who make more mistakes than their students.” He argued, for example, that they had mistaken Reblochon, a soft cheese from the area, for Cheddar. Michelin officials have denied the cheese error and other accusations.  Mr. Veyrat’s lawyer, Emmanuel Ravanas, said in a statement on Tuesday that his client was like any other student who would not “accept being graded without knowing the grading criteria or the scoring.” Mr. Malka, the guide’s lawyer, called Mr. Veyrat’s comments baseless and far-fetched.  Several chefs have turned in their three stars in the past, citing financial struggles or the pressure of maintaining the prestige of the distinction. In 2017, the chef Sébastien Le Bras said he wanted to “be liberated from the pressure” when he asked the guide to strip Le Suquet, his restaurant in southern France, of its three stars. For Mr. Veyrat, the downgrade — and the resulting publicity — appear to have been good for business: Revenues for La Maison des Bois are up 7 percent from 2018, he said, and the restaurant has never been so full. “I don’t really need them,” Mr. Veyrat said of the stars. “If they could also strip me of the two other ones, I’d be more than happy.”  Aurelien Breeden reported from Paris, and Elian Peltier from London.

Climate Change and Political Chaos: A Deadly Mix in Honduras Dengue Epidemic,2019-12-29,By Kirk Semple,"['CHOLOMA, Honduras — More than 400 people died this year as one of the worst dengue epidemics on record swept through Central America — a type of outbreak that some scientists and public health officials are warning is likely to become more frequent and more widespread because of climate change.  But while climate change is threatening to increase the spread of dengue worldwide by expanding the range of the mosquitoes that carry the virus, the disease has already found an especially fertile breeding ground in Honduras, for reasons that go beyond the environment.  In Honduras, which accounted for more than 40 percent of the dengue deaths in Central America this year, according to the Pan American Health Organization, the effects of climate change have been compounded by government dysfunction, political tumult and public apathy. Dengue has hit the country hard. This year, it had more than 107,000 cases of the viral disease — more than 13 times the number recorded last year — and at least 175 deaths. In 2018, only three people in Honduras died from the disease, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Honduras’s notorious criminality has worsened matters, too, as public health teams, already stretched thin by budget cuts and a lack of trained personnel, have been blocked by gangs from entering some of the most severely afflicted neighborhoods to educate residents and fumigate against mosquito infestations. Dengue is transmitted to humans by a type of mosquito called Aedes, which thrives in urban areas of the world’s tropical and subtropical regions. Tens of millions of cases occur each year in more than 100 countries, and symptoms may include fever, internal bleeding and shock. Inadequately treated, the illness can quickly kill. In Honduras, health officials trace the start of the current epidemic to the fall of 2018. The number of incidents then rose sharply during the first half of 2019, hitting a peak this summer before falling off as the year ended. A nationwide health emergency declared in July by the administration of President Juan Orlando Hernández remains in effect. The outbreak struck during a time of political turbulence in Honduras, with violent street protests against Mr. Hernández and calls for his ouster. Some of the protests have been driven by fears the government planned to privatize the health and education sectors.  The nation also suffers from high murder rates and widespread poverty, which have combined to drive tens of thousands of Hondurans in recent years to emigrate, with many trying to make it to the United States. The dengue outbreak has met little resistance from a public health system gutted by budget cuts and pervasive corruption, analysts and officials said. “It’s a collapsed system, an inefficient system,” said Ismael Zepeda, an economist with Fosdeh, a research group in Tegucigalpa, the capital. Surveillance programs intended to detect outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases were feeble. The nation’s poorly supplied and understaffed medical facilities lacked the capacity to adequately handle even the nation’s normal demands, much less an epidemic of historic proportions requiring a fast, highly organized response. “In another country there would be many sick but not as many deaths,” said Eduardo Ortíz, an adviser on sustainable development and environmental health for the Pan American Health Organization in Honduras. “The cure for dengue is political.” The epidemic in Honduras has been particularly brutal in the northern department, or province, of Cortés, the industrial heartland of Honduras. It got started early in this region and spread quickly through its main cities, San Pedro Sula and Choloma.  Cortés then became a kind of engine for the national crisis, officials said, as its large migratory population of factory workers helped spread the disease to other regions on visits home, officials said. The epidemic has had a particularly devastating impact on Cortés’s low-income neighborhoods, which suffer from overburdened and ill-equipped public services and poor health care resources.  The epidemic caught Wendy Carcamo and her family unaware early this year.  Though the outbreak had already begun to bedevil Honduras, Ms. Carcamo said she knew little about it. Then one day in February, her son, Jostin Pineda, 7, suddenly fell ill.  “All day he was happy,” Ms. Carcamo recalled of her son. But by nightfall he was suffering a brutal headache and a high fever.  In the ensuing days, Ms. Carcamo said, Jostin’s illness was misdiagnosed by doctors at three local, private health clinics in a poor sector of Choloma. The last doctor referred the boy to the main public hospital in San Pedro Sula. But by then the disease was too far along, and he died the following morning. It’s a story of missed opportunities that has become remarkably common during this outbreak in Honduras. “As a parent, I wasn’t well prepared,” Ms. Carcamo said. “And as doctors, they weren’t well-prepared.” She added: “Everything happened too fast.” Dr. Dinorah Nolasco, the regional health director in Cortés, acknowledged that one of the main factors contributing to the epidemic’s spread was the shortage of trained personnel focused on prevention, education and response. “In the face of the virus and its speed, we weren’t prepared,” she said. Dr. Nolasco said her teams also had difficulty getting access to certain neighborhoods where armed gangs hold sway and harbor a suspicion of outsiders, particularly from the government. In the poor, violent neighborhood of López Arellano in Choloma, Dr. Nolasco’s teams were blocked for months by gang members from getting into certain areas and were unable to survey for mosquito breeding grounds, educate residents or fumigate.  Government personnel were able to secure regular access only after Dr. Nolasco held a series of meetings with community leaders, who then negotiated with gang leaders. By then, however, López Arellano had already become a dengue hot spot, with thousands of infections. Access remains a fraught issue. One worker for the health ministry has had to pay bribes to gang members — in small amounts of cash or marijuana — to do her work. While better governance and bigger budgets would have helped contain the Honduran epidemic, scientists and public health experts say, they also point to another factor that might have contributed to the intensity and scope of the outbreak: meteorological conditions that are beyond the ability of one country to mitigate.  Honduras this year endured a drought so severe that it merited an emergency declaration in September by the government. But the nation also suffered bouts of unexpectedly intense rainfall, part of a pattern of increasing weather variability that climate scientists say is most likely related to climate change. Some of this variability has created conditions that, in the absence of a strong governmental program of disease control, has allowed dengue to flourish. During periods of extreme drought, residents living in neighborhoods without a reliable public water supply — as is the case in much of Honduras — will sometimes store water in their homes, providing more potential mosquito breeding sites. And during heavy rainfall, flooding can provide more breeding environments, particularly in areas with poor drainage systems. “With climate change, we have rainy periods where there were once dry periods, dry periods when there was rain,” Dr. Nolasco lamented. “Before we had three cycles of spraying. Now we have to spray year-round.” But experts caution that no single epidemic can be attributed wholly to climate change. “In general, climate change is one of the multitude of factors affecting dengue,” said Rachel Lowe, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who researches the connection between climate and the spread of diseases. Honduran public health officials are particularly worried about apathy, an enduring problem throughout the epidemic, particularly among poor, vulnerable populations. “People are thinking about other problems,” said Dr. Nolasco, the regional health director. “If I’m a mother and I have three children, four children, I’m going to be thinking about what I’m going to feed them, whether my son is running with the gangs. They’ll be thinking least of all about dengue.” During a visit to López Arellano this month, Dr. Nolasco stopped by the home of one family that had lost a child to dengue. She inspected a basin where water was stored for washing clothes and found hundreds of mosquito larvae swimming around. She found the same thing at a house across the street. “How do you educate the population?” she said later, frustration in her voice. “In what moment is the public going to help?” Though the number of cases reported per day in Honduras has fallen sharply from the epidemic’s peak in July, Dr. Nolasco frets that scenes like this are part of the reason there may be a resurgence of cases in the new year.  “I don’t even know what’s coming in January, February, March,” she said, sounding exhausted. “It could get worse.”']","Rising temperatures are increasing the range of disease-bearing mosquitoes globally. But in Honduras, the effects are compounded by government dysfunction and criminal gangs."

"Left Behind by Migrant Husbands, Women Break the Rules and Go to Work",2019-12-30,By Dionne Searcey and Laura Boushnak,"['KOUTIA, Senegal — Years had passed since her husband had crossed the sea to look for work in Europe. Left behind, Khadijah Diagouraga trudged to the couple’s peanut fields alone every day, struggling to earn enough to provide for an extended family of 13. When the town’s water pump broke and her faucet went dry, she tied a donkey to a cart to haul water from a nearby well, cursing her absent husband the whole way. Her action shocked this small, conservative village in rural Senegal. Guiding animals was men’s work, village leaders said.  “It’s not a sight I ever wanted to see,” said Baba Diallo, 70, sitting in the shade of a dried cornstalk canopy, shaking his head as if to rid himself of the memory. Across West Africa, villages have been emptied of husbands and sons in their prime who set out for Europe to look for work and never returned. Women, realizing they might never see the money their men promised to send home, have gradually taken on what are seen as men’s roles, earning money and running large households of in-laws and other extended family members.  “There are a couple men who look down on me,” Ms. Diagouraga said. “I ignore them. What matters to me is hard work.” Senegal is among the countries most affected by the phenomenon of missing men. Senegalese were among the top 10 nationalities to land in Italy during a spike in migration in the middle of the decade. Although migration to Europe has dropped sharply as nationalism has led some European countries to impose tighter controls, West African communities are still reeling, with many of their men gone now for years.  Some will never return, perishing while crossing the desert or drowning at sea. In Koutia and the few surrounding villages, at least 130 people have died in recent years on the journey, local officials said. Many of Senegal’s migrants come from sun-bleached flatlands near Koutia in the east that rely almost entirely on peanuts and a handful of other crops for income, even as a yearslong drought shows no sign of letting up. Many working-age men here have given up. The village chief of Koutia estimates that in little more than one generation, 200 men from the 95 households have migrated to Europe. Many were the family’s chief earners. The lure of Europe is on display in Senegal’s villages. Amid the clusters of shabby mud-brick homes are houses made of cement, some two stories tall, painted and surrounded by cement walls. All were paid for with money sent home by migrants. Ms. Diagouraga and her husband used to pass those homes as they walked to their peanut fields. They saw the satellite dishes on rooftops and neighbors clutching iPhones. Then there was the shiny, tiled mosque with towering minaret, which the village chief bragged had been built with money pooled from local migrants. A few villagers could even afford cars. Ms. Diagouraga’s husband, Mohamed Diawara, had bought a small automated mill to grind millet and corn to sell. But fuel for the device was expensive, and it was constantly breaking down. Farming was tough, too. Each harvest seemed smaller than the one before. Mr. Diawara had only one donkey to help him till the soil, while his neighbors had sophisticated plows. Mr. Diawara had been saving to buy a new part for his mill, but told his wife he wanted to use the money instead to pay smugglers to take him to Italy.  She knew it was dangerous; three men from Koutia had died trying that same year. Stay and we’ll make it work, Ms. Diagouraga pleaded. But we’ve been living hand-to-mouth all these years, he told her. “He has a man’s heart,” Ms. Diagouraga said. “It was hard telling him not to go.” Mr. Diawara left one morning five years ago, just as the call to prayer sounded. She pressed into his arms a blue-and-white blanket she had embroidered for him and spent the whole day crying. Five months passed with no word. “I wasn’t sure if he was alive,” Ms. Diagouraga said. “Maybe he lost his phone? I had heard stories of migrants being robbed. Maybe he died in prison? Or at sea?” She was busy cooking the day he finally called. He was in Italy, he said, and had been through hell to get there. He didn’t give her details; the important thing was that he had made it. She thanked him for risking his life to help his family. It was four more months until he called again. Communication between the couple became brief and infrequent. Finally, he sent money — the equivalent of $20. An entire year passed before he sent cash again. Work in Europe is far from guaranteed for many migrants. Mr. Diawara said in a telephone interview that he was sharing a room with four other men and sometimes went days without eating. His salary working day jobs on a cleaning crew was too little. He couldn’t afford to go home.  Ms. Diagouraga knew life was hard for him. But she was now supporting not only her own two children, but his family too: several nieces and nephews and Mr. Diawara’s ailing mother. Left to her thoughts, Ms. Diagouraga sometimes got angry at her husband. What if he was cheating on her in Italy? She put the thought out of her mind. Sleeping alone in their double bed with its yellow bedspread and wooden headboard, she missed intimacy.  She had thought about leaving her husband. But she loved him. And how could she leave a man who was only trying to do better for his family? Women in nearby villages in similar situations had divorced migrant husbands to find companions closer to home. In Magali, Ida Traoré, 32, became pregnant with twins while her husband was living in France.  Her father-in-law called France to tell his son, Abdoulaye Diarsso, that his wife was having an affair. Mr. Diarsso immediately phoned her, to apologize. He had been away 13 years, after all. “She has sexual urges,” Mr. Diarsso said during his first visit with his wife since he’d left. “It’s difficult to accept, but if I ignore this, I’m not being honest.” Some women are still subject to the rules of older men who step in while their sons are abroad. In the village of Niaouli Tanoun, where six men have left for Europe, their wives complained that one aging father-in-law had barred them from walking around freely, let alone earning money. But elsewhere, women have united and prevailed. In Magali, wives of migrants garden together, sharing harvests and lending one another money. They are led by Safy Diakhaby, 28, whose husband left for Europe when she became pregnant 11 years ago. She had urged him to go. He has sent home enough cash to build a concrete home, but not enough to support the 21 people in her compound. She hired a crew of men to work the fields, and knowing that they might be reluctant to listen to a woman, she cooks lunch as an incentive. She stores peanuts to sell when the crop is out of season and scarce. She shares her bounty with other struggling women. “If we don’t help each other, we all suffer,” Ms. Diakhaby said. But many migrants’ wives have resorted to handouts, which is just what many male elders say they prefer. Habsatou Diallo lives down a winding dirt path in Koutia not far from Ms. Diagouraga. Her husband left for Europe six years ago without saying goodbye. She hasn’t heard from him since. The clay oven Ms. Diallo had used to bake bread to sell at the market fell apart without him to maintain it. She has no money anyway to buy flour. She depends on her father-in-law for handouts. Ms. Diagouraga considered begging herself one day when she went to wash her clothes and realized she was out of laundry soap. She couldn’t afford more — let alone school fees for her children. “Who could I even ask for help?” she said. “I was angry at everything. I thought it was best I just do things for myself.”  She decided to work harder. She hooked up the donkey to plow, and to haul water from the well. She started to earn a bit of cash from her harvest and set up a shop selling tea and sandwiches. She heard hushed comments from onlookers. She saw them staring. Women should rely on charity, some of the men said. Others said she wasn’t strong enough. Some said they felt sorry for her. Ms. Diagouraga recently fell ill and had to buy medicine with the money intended for tea-shop supplies. One afternoon when her 5-year-old daughter bounded in from school with a tuition bill, Ms. Diagouraga just stared at it. The bill was for less than a dollar, but still more than she could afford. “I’ll go talk to your teacher and tell him to be patient,” she said. And then she got to work, soaking beans for dinner and sweating as she ran behind a donkey, urging it to hoist pails of water from a deep well. Some of the village’s few remaining young men were sprawled nearby in the shade. They lifted their heads to watch her on that baking afternoon. “I pray God will help her see the fruits of her labor,” said Hamidou Diawara, 19.  They had been there for hours doing nothing, Mr. Diawara said, daydreaming about sailing to Europe.

Nicaragua Frees Political Prisoners After International Pressure,2019-12-30,By Frances Robles,"['Prison guards came at 2 a.m. to wake Scannierth Merlo Lacayo, saying it was time to change cells. But then he saw other political prisoners being moved about and spiffed up. “They were giving everyone new pants, shirts, cutting their hair,” he said. Then Mr. Merlo saw representatives of the Roman Catholic Church and the Red Cross and realized that the moment he had been awaiting for 14 months had finally arrived: He and dozens of other political prisoners in Nicaragua were being freed after months of international clamor. Their sudden release on Monday came after the United States government strengthened sanctions against the authoritarian government of Daniel Ortega, tightening a financial noose around a regime that has been condemned around the world for its crackdown on dissent. “I had been sentenced to five years for supposedly stealing a Sandinista Party member’s I.D. card, but the real reason was because I was against the government — and I am going to continue to be against the government,” Mr. Merlo said in a telephone interview shortly after his release. Mr. Merlo’s mother, Diana Lacayo, was among nine women who went on a hunger strike last month to demand their loved ones’ freedom. The women took refuge in a Catholic church, but their protest quickly went awry when the government cut off its power and water and surrounded the building with police officers. The women and several supporters were trapped for nine days as their supplies dwindled. A group of people who took them water were arrested and charged with trafficking weapons. Known as the “aguadores,” they were also released Monday. Brenda Gutiérrez, who runs a support group for the families, said 65 of Nicaragua’s 148 political prisoners had been released by late morning. Many of them had been accused of crimes such as arms trafficking, drug trafficking and robbery after participating in a large-scale uprising last year. It was unclear whether more people would be released as the day went on, she said.  The government issued a statement saying that 91 people were being released as a gesture of national reconciliation. But it suggested that their sentences were being converted to a form of house arrest, as opposed to the charges’ being dropped. Protests erupted in Nicaragua in April 2018, initially over cuts to social security. When government supporters attacked elderly demonstrators, students around the nation hit the streets in protest. Soon, hundreds of thousands of protesters were holding rallies, blocking traffic and taking over universities. The focus of the protests soon moved beyond social security to the broader issue of democracy. Mr. Ortega, the president, and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, are accused of running a draconian government that has cheated in elections. The government has done away with the opposition, eliminated term limits and cracked down harshly on dissent. Protesters have demanded their ouster.  Hundreds of people died in the months of protests, including 22 police officers. The government unleashed broad police actions to topple road blocks and take back universities. More than 500 people were jailed.  Opposition activists in the country rarely dare to protest publicly.  “This is a great day for Nicaragua, because it proves what we had been saying all along: There are political prisoners in Nicaragua,” said Martha Alvarado, whose 30-year-old son, Melkissedex A. López Ferrey, was also released from prison. “We never lost faith, and we are not giving up until everyone is free.” Alfonso Flores Bermúdez contributed reporting.']",The release of dozens of Nicaraguan detainees came amid bolstered United States sanctions and criticism of a crackdown on hunger strikers.
Somali Terror Group Al Shabab Remains Resilient Despite Setbacks,2019-12-29,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — The terror group Al Shabab, suspected in the weekend attack that killed 79 people in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, has proved resilient in recent years even as it lost territory, suffered high-level defections and faced increasing airstrikes by the United States. Almost a decade since African peacekeeping forces kicked the Al Qaeda-linked group out of Mogadishu, it has become deft in handling its operations, versatile in using guerrilla tactics and prolific in manufacturing bombs.  Over the past few years, the Shabab killed hundreds of people in attacks at home and on neighboring Kenya, assaulted an American military base outside Mogadishu and overran military bases of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.  To finance itself, the militants have set up an extensive racketeering system that levies fees on sales of agricultural produce in southern and central Somalia — areas that are the stronghold of the group. They also tax imports into the Mogadishu port, according to the United Nations.  The Shabab have also been able to infiltrate federal institutions — they claimed to have recruited a government employee to kill Mogadishu’s mayor, Abdirahman Omar Osman, in July. And the group’s growing assertiveness was in evidence when it declared war last year on pro-Islamic State groups in Somalia in a fight over territory. “Al Shabab is still strong and stable,” said Stig Jarle Hansen, the author of “Horn, Sahel and Rift: Fault-lines of the African Jihad.” The ongoing threat it poses, he said, goes to show that the  “government still has a lot of work to do when it comes to providing safety and security for its ordinary citizens.” The government said at least 79 people were killed and 149 injured when a truck bomb detonated at a busy intersection on Saturday — the deadliest attack in the country in more two years. While no group has taken responsibility yet, suspicion immediately fell on the Shabab, which remains a serious threat to peace and stability in Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa region.   The magnitude of the attack was the latest reminder of the deteriorating security situation in Somalia — one of the world’s most fragile states — even as the nation takes piecemeal efforts toward recovery from a decades-long civil war.  The weak government is afflicted by internal dysfunction and corruption and oversees an ineffective security force. Efforts to rebuild a functional security apparatus to face off against the Shabab have proved easier said than done.  The government has a number of external backers, including the African Union, the United Nations and the United States, which are helping it build a functional police force. In 2017, Turkey set up its largest overseas military base in Somalia in a bid to train and equip more than 10,000 Somali soldiers. But while these entities continue to support the Somali Army in the liberation of key towns from the militants, the Shabab sometimes retake those towns immediately afterward, because of the federal government’s inability to securely govern them.  On Sunday, the Pentagon’s Africa Command, which oversees military relations with African states, said in a statement that it conducted three airstrikes against Al Shabab, killing four militants. “The government has failed to become credible and legitimate in the eyes of the public,” said Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst. The country’s security services “are in complete disarray,” he added, undermining efforts to successfully hold off attacks. Somalia has also become a proxy battleground for Gulf powers looking to expand their economic and political influence in the Horn of Africa, with both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates accused of delivering military training to various regional security forces. But where the Somali government continues to seek external support, the Shabab has learned to be “self-reliant” and “operate on a shoestring budget,” Mr. Abdi said. “There must be foreign help, but it is very minimal and very negligible,” he said. And where they enlist support, it must be with making and securely posting some of its sophisticated propaganda online. In November, a group of United Nations experts said the Shabab’s use of improvised explosive devices to carry out attacks reached its “greatest extent in Somali history” last year thanks to growing bomb-making operations.  But Mr. Abdi said that nothing has boosted Al Shabab’s recent rise more than the stagnation of the government in Mogadishu. While the country has made tremendous political, social and economic progress since the federal government was established in 2012, it still faces poverty, high unemployment, and periodic natural disasters. Over the past year, a standoff between the central government and federal states over electoral processes has added to the threats to Somalia’s stability. Even in areas controlled by the government, the authorities struggle to provide basic services and overcome corruption and mismanagement of state institutions.  The Shabab, on the other hand, mediates to resolve day-to-day problems — especially land disputes —  even in areas it doesn’t control, Mr. Abdi said. “Al Shabab feeds on these weaknesses and grows in strength,” he said. Civilians are bearing the brunt of the growing bloodshed that has gripped major Somali towns and cities in recent years. Tired of the vicious cycle of violence and slow government response, citizens have started taking matters into their own hands during emergencies.  Following Saturday’s attack, a group of 19 young men and women crowded into a room in Mogadishu and came up with a grass-roots organization to track and identify dead or missing people, share the names and locations of those injured, appeal for global attention and seek financial support. During times of crises, the government’s response “is at best tepid and at worst inhumane,” said the group’s coordinator, Abdihakim Ainte. Within hours of their formation on Saturday evening, they raised $20,000 from people in three countries, Mr. Ainte said. On Sunday, as the group’s membership ballooned, they sent counselors to hospitals to support families and victims. “The idea is driven by self-reliance,” Mr. Ainte said. “This is a Somali tragedy and it should have a Somali response.” Among the victims were parents going to work, students heading to university, foreign engineers building roads, and shop owners. The attack resembled another in October 2017 when a double truck bombing detonated at a busy crossroads in Mogadishu and killed nearly 600 people.  While the Shabab didn’t take responsibility, it was similar to others carried out by the group that involved packing a vehicle with explosives to breach the perimeter of a target followed by a direct assault by gunmen.  ']","The group suspected in a weekend attack that killed 79 people has lost territory, suffered defections and been targeted by increasing United States airstrikes. But it can still mount large attacks."
Merkel’s New Year’s Speech Calls for Action on Climate and Tolerance,2019-12-31,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — The coming decade will be a hopeful one if the people of Germany come together to fight climate change, support development in Africa, and thwart hate and anti-Semitism at home, Chancellor Angela Merkel told her nation on Tuesday in her 15th annual New Year’s speech. “The ’20s can be good years,” she said. “Let’s surprise ourselves once again with what we can do.”  It’s a tall order. While many in the country saw a strong youth protest movement as a hopeful sign and a slowdown in the arrival of new refugees to the country as the defusing of a crisis, 2019 was a difficult year for Germany. It brought the rise of far-right extremism, a slowing economy and an increasingly fraught relationship with major trading partners, including the United States. And overarching all of that is the threat of climate change, with Germany experiencing record-breaking temperatures and extreme droughts, floods and snowstorms in the past decade.  “I, as a 65-year-old, will not personally experience all of the consequences that climate change will bring if politicians do not act,” Ms. Merkel said in her roughly five-minute speech, adding that coming generations would “live with the consequences of what we do or fail to do today.” Many of those younger people have been skipping school to stage mass protests in Berlin and other German cities since 2018, calling for action on climate change. In her speech, the chancellor referred to recently passed laws designed to help decrease Germany’s carbon emissions —\xa0regulations that many have criticized as being too weak, but which Ms. Merkel says lay the framework needed to take effective environmental action. “We need, now more than ever, the courage to think in new ways, the strength to leave well-trodden paths, the readiness to venture into new territory and the resolve to act more quickly,” she said, adding that it was essential to do so “if a good life on this planet is to be possible for today’s young people and those who come after them.”  It is unclear how many viewers tune in to watch the chancellor’s New Year’s speech and receive her New Year’s wishes —\xa0which was once a tradition in many households — given competing traditions on a day widely and exuberantly celebrated by Germans. Last year, three million households watched the first televised version on the host broadcaster. Tuesday’s New Year’s address by Ms. Merkel may be her last. Although she has repeatedly vowed to stay in office until the next scheduled election, in 2021, her coalition government is unpopular, and pundits have been discussing her early exit since she announced in 2018 that she would not run for re-election.  She used the speech as an opportunity to emphasize the importance of public safety and the safety of local politicians, at a time when far-right and hate-filled crimes have shaken Germany. In June, a state politician was murdered on his front porch by a far-right extremist. And in October, an armed man tried to enter a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle, in an anti-Semitic and racially motivated attack in which he killed two people. “Protecting them — like all people in our country — from hatred, hostility and violence, from racism and anti-Semitism, is the duty of the state, and it is a duty to which the federal government has a particular commitment,” Ms. Merkel said. Ms. Merkel also said it was essential to work with African nations where people are experiencing hardship and turmoil, so that they can prosper there rather than turning to Europe’s shores in desperation. “Cooperation with Africa lies in our own interests,” she said, “for only when people have the chance to live in peace and safety will flight and migration be reduced.” Such public addresses by German leaders, comparable to the State of the Union address in America or President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fireside chats, have their roots in the era of the Kaiser around the turn of the 20th century and were first televised in the 1950s.  In its postwar history, the New Year’s speech has not always gone without a glitch. On Dec. 31, 1986, the public broadcaster accidentally replayed Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s speech from the previous year, in an apparent case of human error, although supporters of Mr. Kohl charged that it was an act of political sabotage.']","The German chancellor, in her 15th such address, expressed optimism about the coming decade despite large challenges ahead."
"Amid Balmy Winter, Moscow Trucked in Heaps of Fake Snow. A Blizzard Ensued.",2019-12-30,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — The authorities in Moscow had spent millions on Christmas trees, sparkling lights and other holiday decorations, but the festive mood was still missing something: Winter weather.  As the warmest December on record drew to a close, little snow had fallen, so the city made artificial snow and trucked it to parts of the city center — and much of it quickly melted into slush. Images of trucks unloading snow spread fast on social media, as observers ridiculed the government for spending money on something that usually just falls from the sky.  “With the Moscow budget, you can buy anything, even winter,” one user wrote on Twitter, pointing to the vast wealth disparity between the capital and the rest of Russia. “Let’s install freezing machines along the Tverskaya,” another one wrote, referring to the city’s main thoroughfare, where the authorities said the snow would be used to build a hill for snowboarders.  Many Muscovites on the streets appeared to be less scornful. They said they had missed the snow and welcomed the decision to bring it ahead of New Year’s Eve, the main family holiday in Russia, when the country stops for a week to celebrate. At a time of year when temperatures usually stay well below freezing, Moscow has had some highs in the mid-40s Fahrenheit in the past two weeks. As if to mock the artificial scene, a blizzard enveloped Moscow on Monday night, leaving a natural snow cover on city streets — but forecasts say that, too, will melt away before the New Year.  “Yes, they brought the snow, and of course when they did it, a snowfall began, too,” said Larisa B. Artamonova, 70, a retired engineer. “It will all create a festive mood, I am sure.” Muscovites have a difficult relationship with snow. While many like it as a sign of the holidays, others complain that snowfall produces traffic jams, the salt spread on roads ruins shoes and the mixture turns into a dirty, gray muck.  Last week, Moscow City Hall blocked many central streets around the Kremlin for the holiday season, which will last into the next week. Apart from the snowboard hill on the Tverskaya, a stash of snow was also spotted on Red Square, surrounded by a fence — as though to keep people from stealing any — and another appeared in the new Zaradye Park nearby.  The artificial snow was produced by cutting ice at skating rinks around the city, the authorities said.  “The machines there cut ice, producing ice crumbs, so we brought it,” a city official, Aleksei Nemeryuk told Govorit Moskva, a local radio station.  As the climate has heated up in recent years, Russia, like much of the world, has experienced record-breaking heat, with 2019 being the warmest year since observations began, according to meteorologists.  Many northern communities in Russia are built on permafrost that no longer merits the label, melting steadily and forcing people to relocate. Hunters and fishermen have had to change their routines as animals shift their migration routes.  The ice that polar bears traverse to hunt at sea has receded so far that the hungry animals are scavenging on land; in February, dozens of them roamed around a settlement in the Far North in search of food. There have been reports of brown bears, too warm to hibernate, out looking for meals, too. Ski resorts in Sochi, a city on the Black Sea, said Sunday that they would limit the number of ski passes sold during the holiday season because the dearth of snow meant that only 20 percent of trails could be opened.  “Winters have turned much warmer over the past 30 years,” said Yelena Morenko, 55, walking with her husband, Aleksandr, along Petrovka, one of Moscow’s most elegant streets. “The season has shifted for at least one month.” Russia could also reap benefits from global warming. Gas and oil companies are expected to benefit from easier access to raw materials in the Arctic and eastern Siberia. Russia is currently building a fleet of icebreakers to take advantage of the warming northern sea route.  Keeping Muscovites in a festive mood has been among the top priorities of the city’s ambitious mayor, Sergei S. Sobyanin, who presides over the country’s richest and most contrarian city. The government has invested heavily in improving the city’s infrastructure and has held various festivals that at times keep Moscow’s main squares and streets busy with something other than anti-Kremlin protests.  “I don’t think there is much to see here, we came to Moscow to celebrate,” said Angelina Amelina, 25, who came to the capital from St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city.  Walking with her boyfriend, Pavel, along the red walls of the Kremlin, Ms. Amelina said, “With or without snow, it is hard to create a Christmas-like atmosphere here; there are too many people and the people are so stressed.”']","Lacking snow to complete the holiday atmosphere, Moscow bought fake snow from skating rinks. “It will all create a festive mood, I am sure,” one Muscovite said."
"Macron Stands by Contested Pension Plan, Despite Pressure From Marathon Strike",2019-12-31,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Under pressure to resolve a crippling transport strike that is weighing on the lives of his countrymen, President Emmanuel Macron of France insisted Tuesday night that he was not giving up on a pensions overhaul that has brought thousands of workers into the streets. If France was waiting for Mr. Macron to suggest an exit strategy for ending the onerous strike — and French media has been full of such speculation in recent days — it would have been waiting in vain: The president’s main message, in the traditional New Year’s Eve address to France, was that he was standing firm. The strike entered its 27th day Tuesday, and is now longer than the benchmark 1995 shutdown that fatally weakened the government at the time. Most trains are still canceled across France, the subway in Paris is largely shuttered, the capital’s streets often resemble a giant parking lot, and unions look as determined as ever to face the government down. Mr. Macron nonetheless hinted that there could be possible changes to his plan in order to get the striking rail and subway workers back to work. In his speech, he urged his own prime minister to find “a path of rapid compromise, while respecting the principles I have mentioned,” to end the strike.  Last year, Mr. Macron used the annual New Year’s address to try to bring calm after weeks of violent Yellow Vest protests motivated by inequality, the cost of fuel and other issues.  This time he is facing a more intractable social protest, because the strike is more organized and better led. Union leaders have been invigorated by an unexpected boost in their strength, and the strike movement appears to have the support of a majority of the French, despite the travel inconveniences. Still, on two essential points that continue to arouse the anger of the most hard-line unions — the ones leading the strike — Mr. Macron showed no sign of giving ground. He insisted that his measures will end France’s patchwork system of 42 different pension plans, replacing it with a uniform system based on points accumulated over time. The conversion to points was being done in the name of “justice and social progress,” Mr. Macron said. “One euro contributed will give the same rights to everybody, from the first hour of work. That’s far from the case today,” he said. “We want everybody to benefit from a worthy pension, especially those who have been forgotten by the present system.” And he repeated the word “responsibility,” which has come to represent a red flag for many unions; for Mr. Macron’s government, it means that people must work longer, and the retirement age will be effectively pushed from 62 to 64 for many. With the ratio of workers to retirees in decline, officials argue that the pensions system can’t avoid crippling deficit unless working lives are lengthened. “I know that change often upsets. But fear shouldn’t mean inaction,” Mr. Macron said. “There’s too much to do.” Mr. Macron remained vague in important points, some analysts said. “He said, ‘find an agreement,’ but he didn’t say where to give ground,” said Chloé Morin, a public opinion expert at the Fondation Jean-Jaurès, a Paris think tank.  “He’s cultivating a posture, a position, of determination,” she said, noting that Mr. Macron delivered his speech Tuesday night standing up, in contrast to the sitting position of his predecessors. In practice, though, Mr. Macron has been giving small concessions to different professional groups all month, perhaps indicating that larger concessions could be possible. For the police, he partly scrapped the increased retirement age. For railway and subway workers, he is allowing a later start with the new system. Airline pilots will continue to be able to retire at 60. Dancers at the Paris Opera, who can retire at 42, will continue under the present pensions system, except for those hired after 2022. “They’ve been piling up the concessions,” said Ms. Morin, noting that this strategy could be perceived as giving up on the larger project. In any case, these compromises have not calmed the atmosphere of confrontation with the unions, which in recent days have accused the French government of letting the situation fester in order to turn public opinion against the strikers. Mr. Macron’s ministers in turn have accused the unions of banking on a strategy of intimidation to keep their rank and file in line. With the number of strikers in slow but steady decline — though maintaining a critical mass to cripple transit — tensions have been mounting. On Tuesday, a video widely disseminated on Twitter showed striking Paris subway workers harassing a colleague who chose to go to work. Early reactions to Mr. Macron’s speech from his political rivals, and the unions, were hostile, foreshadowing a continuing hardening of positions. “These weren’t New Year’s good wishes, but a declaration of war on millions of Frenchmen who are rejecting his reform,” said the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon on Twitter. “It seemed like an extraterrestrial speaking,” he said. “It’s the same formulas we’ve been hearing for two years,” the union leader Yves Veyrier said on BFM-TV. “He hasn’t convinced anybody with his points-based system.”']","In his annual New Year's Eve speech, President Emmanuel Macron of France hinted there could be changes to his plan, though he insisted “fear shouldn’t mean inaction.” "
"Fireworks, Long a German New Year’s Eve Tradition, Are Losing Their Luster",2019-12-30,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — Fireworks have long been a staple of New Year’s Eve celebrations in Germany, with revelers setting off their own pyrotechnics in the annual reverie of booze and exuberance known in the country as “Silvester.” But for the first time this year, Berlin will join dozens of other German cities and communities in instituting a partial ban on private fireworks, with three zones in the capital designated fireworks free on New Year’s Eve. Most official and private fireworks displays will continue as normal — including the spectacular show at Berlin’s iconic Brandenburg Gate — and skies over much of the country will still be alight, saturated with the sound of millions of tiny explosions. But as the decade comes to a close, Germany’s commitment to one of its most enduring New Year’s Eve traditions seems to be wavering. The reasons vary: Berlin’s ban is focused on public safety, while Aachen, a town in western Germany that limited the use of high-flying fireworks, is worried about potential damage to its historic buildings. And some areas pointed to environmental and health concerns over the fine dust particles created by the explosions.  “I’m convinced that for the next Silvester celebration, private fireworks vanish in medium and large cities in Germany,” said Jürgen Resch, the co-leader of Environmental Action Germany, an organization that has sued cities into diesel driving bans. (Germans refer to New Year’s Eve as Silvester in honor of Pope Silvester, whose saint’s day is Dec. 31.) Fine-particle emissions spike in the days after New Year’s celebrations, according to Germany’s federal office for the environment: Fireworks lit on just one day each year amount to as much as a quarter of the particle emissions given off yearly by all wood-fires in the country. Under the banner of “Silvesters for Future,” a nod toward the Fridays for Future movement launched by Greta Thunberg, the Swedish environmental activist, Mr. Resch’s group contacted 98 areas with higher than average particle measurements and asked them to change their New Year’s Eve tradition.  Thirty-six communities wrote back promising to make alternative arrangements for the celebration, if not this year then sometime in the future. The federal government is also considering changing a law that would allow cities the autonomy to ban the use of private fireworks altogether. “One of the biggest changes is the awakening of the youth on this issue,” said Mr. Resch, who described a yearslong debate about the issue. A poll conducted by the research firm YouGov for the German RND news service showed shifting attitudes, with 57 percent of respondents saying they thought a ban was a positive idea. Another poll, conducted by YouGov last year, indicated that 61 percent of people polled thought fireworks should be forbidden in dense city centers, and 86 percent felt the tradition produced too much garbage. Private fireworks have a long-established history in Germany, where they’ve been at the core of Silvester celebrations for years. Many Germans spend hundreds of euros on their own private firework displays.  The German Pyrotechnic Industry Association, a trade group that has represented firework makers since the 1960s, estimates that last year roughly 130 million euros were spent on legal fireworks in Germany. Under the current rules, fireworks can be sold on the three business days preceding New Year’s Eve, though two major German supermarket chains and a home hardware business recently announced plans to phase out or reduce fireworks sales. The fireworks can be legally lit only on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1, although in big cities the characteristic bangs can be heard several days before and after that time. Klaus Gotzen, the director of the German Pyrotechnic Industry Association, said that safety has always been a priority for the group, but the conversation around fireworks is changing.  “This year there is a bigger discussion about the meaning of the tradition as such,” he said.  “For the vast majority of people using fireworks it’s about the feeling of joy and the feeling of sharing joy — it’s about a feeling of community,” he said in a telephone interview. Still, the discussion about limiting what some say is an essential part of the New Year’s celebration exposed the usual rift between progressives and conservatives.  These groups last found themselves at odds over another New Year’s Eve tradition when lead was banned in 2018 from use in the traditional “Bleigiessen” — a fortune-telling game that involved pouring molten lead into a bowl of cold water.  A former publisher of the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Hugo Müller-Vogg, suggested in the online version of a newsmagazine, FOCUS, that the changing rules around fireworks might actually cause people to spend more money on fireworks and film this year’s rituals.  “So that one can show one’s grandchildren what once was — a happy Silvester celebration,” Mr. Müller-Vogg wrote. ']","Faced with the concerns about safety, pollution and potential damage to historic buildings, Germany is rethinking private fireworks. "
Samoa Lifts State of Emergency After Deadly Measles Epidemic,2019-12-29,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Samoa announced on Saturday that it would reopen schools and end restrictions on public gatherings as it lifted a six-week state of emergency in the aftermath of a measles epidemic that left scores of children and babies dead.  Since September, more than 5,600 measles cases have been recorded in the Pacific island nation of about 200,000 people, the Health Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. At least 81 people have died, many of them younger than 5.  Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans, and no one in the close-knit country was left untouched.  The disease has resurfaced globally as vaccination rates have fallen, particularly in countries where poverty has left gaps in public health systems, experts said. In 2013, 90 percent of Samoan infants received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine by their first birthday. But by last year, the vaccination rate had dropped to 30 percent. The government said it had been complacent in routine immunizations. When two infants died after nurses inadvertently mixed the vaccine with muscle relaxant instead of sterile water, the country temporarily suspended the vaccination program.  That action, coupled with misinformation about the safety of the vaccine, left children under 5 particularly susceptible to the virus, according to the World Health Organization. When the virus arrived in Samoa from a person who had traveled from New Zealand, which is struggling with its own outbreak, the unvaccinated population was hit particularly hard. Under the state of emergency, schools were closed, children were banned from public gatherings and vaccinations were made compulsory. Early this month, the government shut down to focus on a nationwide vaccination campaign. Dozens of countries and international organizations sent health workers and supplies to help hospitals straining to keep up with the caseload. Health Ministry officials said that 95 percent of eligible people had received vaccinations, the threshold for “herd immunity,” which experts say is required to stop the spread of measles.']","The Pacific island nation will reopen schools after a measles outbreak killed 81 people, many of them children.

North Korea Leader Urges ‘Offensive Measures’ at Top Party Meeting,2019-12-29,By Choe Sang-Hun,"[""SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called for “offensive measures” to strengthen security at a meeting of senior officials, the state-run media reported on Monday, a day before a North Korean-imposed deadline for Washington to make concessions in stalled nuclear talks. Mr. Kim's comments came at a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party, which was convened over the weekend amid North Korean warnings that it was prepared to abandon diplomacy and resume nuclear and long-range missile tests. On Sunday, the second day of the meeting, Mr. Kim emphasized “the need to take positive and offensive measures for fully ensuring the sovereignty and security of the country as required by the present situation,” according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. To that end, Mr. Kim outlined “the duties of the fields of foreign affairs, munitions industry and armed forces,” the news agency reported. It provided no clarifications, including whether North Korea would officially lift its moratorium on testing intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons. Washington has dismissed the Dec. 31 deadline imposed by North Korea as “artificial,” and has urged Pyongyang to maintain a dialogue and not revert to the provocations that had raised fears of war on the Korean Peninsula two years ago. But Mr. Kim’s remarks about “offensive measures” indicated that North Korea was shifting to a harder line amid faltering diplomacy with Washington. President Trump, who has met with the North Korean leader at two summit meetings, has repeatedly cited his “good relationship” with him — at one point, he said he and Mr. Kim “fell in love.” He has frequently cited the North’s testing moratorium as evidence that his policy of engaging with North Korea is working.  North Korea has not been explicit about what might happen after the Dec. 31 deadline expires, but Mr. Kim has warned of finding a “new way” if Washington does not remove the economic sanctions that have crippled his country’s economy or if it tries to force an unpalatable denuclearization deal. The North Korean leader is set to deliver an annual speech on New Year’s Day, and analysts say he may officially reveal a major policy shift to be adopted at the party’s Central Committee. The committee is one of the highest decision-making bodies in North Korea, but it usually rubber-stamps any policy proposed by Mr. Kim, who rules with totalitarian control of the party, the military and all other levers of power. The party meeting was set to continue on Monday, and cover a variety of domestic and external issues, such as how to revive the country’s agriculture and other moribund industries, the news agency reported. Since assuming power in 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un has accelerated his country’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. North Korea has conducted four of its six underground nuclear tests since 2011, and it conducted three intercontinental ballistic missile tests in 2017. But at a Central Committee meeting in April 2018, Mr. Kim declared that with its nuclear force successfully built, North Korea would shift its focus to economic development and halt all nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. Two months later, he met Mr. Trump in Singapore for the first summit meeting between the sitting leaders of North Korea and the United States. Afterward, North Korea sounded victorious, and Mr. Kim promised to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Mr. Trump in turn promised the North security guarantees and “new” relations. But the mood soon soured as the governments began negotiating the details of what incentives Washington should offer in return for the North’s denuclearization and the timeline for doing so. The North demanded the immediate lifting of United Nations sanctions. Washington, however, insisted that North Korea first dismantle its nuclear program. A second meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, held in Vietnam in February, ended without an agreement, and North Korea later warned that Washington must offer a “new calculation” and create a breakthrough in the stalled negotiations by the end of the year. Turning up the pressure, the North has resumed weapons tests, launching 27 mostly short-range ballistic missiles and rockets since May and warning of more provocative tests to come. It warned this month that it was entirely up to the Trump administration “what Christmas gift it will select to get,” and conducted two ground tests at its missile engine test site to bolster what it called its “nuclear deterrent.”  But Christmas Day passed without any long-range missile or nuclear test by North Korea. In recent weeks, North Korean officials have suggested that they have all but concluded that there is little point in continuing negotiations with the politically vulnerable Mr. Trump. They have hardened their position, vowing to keep denuclearization off the table until Washington first revoked its entire “hostile policy,” including ending joint annual military exercises with South Korea. And they have also reverted to calling Mr. Trump insulting names, among them “dotard.”""]",Analysts warn that Kim Jong-un may end a moratorium on testing long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. 
How a Chase Bank Chairman Helped the Deposed Shah of Iran Enter the U.S.,2019-12-29,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['One late fall evening 40 years ago, a worn-out white Gulfstream II jet descended over Fort Lauderdale, Fla., carrying a regal but sickly passenger almost no one was expecting. Crowded aboard were a Republican political operative, a retinue of Iranian military officers, four smelly and hyperactive dogs and Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the newly deposed shah of Iran. Yet as the jet touched down, the only one waiting to receive the deposed monarch was a senior executive of Chase Manhattan Bank, which had not only lobbied the White House to admit the former shah but had arranged visas for his entourage, searched out private schools and mansions for his family and helped arrange the Gulfstream to deliver him. “The Eagle has landed,” Joseph V. Reed Jr., the chief of staff to the bank’s chairman, David Rockefeller, declared in a celebratory meeting at the bank the next morning. Less than two weeks later, on Nov. 4, 1979, vowing revenge for the admission of the shah to the United States, revolutionary Iranian students seized the American Embassy in Tehran and then held more than 50 Americans — and Washington — hostage for 444 days. The shah, Washington’s closest ally in the Persian Gulf, had fled Tehran in January 1979 in the face of a burgeoning uprising against his 38 years of iron-fisted rule. Liberals, leftists and religious conservatives were rallying against him. Strikes and demonstrations had shut down Tehran, and his security forces were losing control. The shah sought refuge in America. But President Jimmy Carter, hoping to forge ties to the new government rising out of the chaos and concerned about the security of the United States Embassy in Tehran, refused him entry for the first 10 months of his exile. Even then, the White House only begrudgingly let him in for medical treatment. Now, a newly disclosed secret history from the offices of Mr. Rockefeller shows in vivid detail how Chase Manhattan Bank and its well-connected chairman worked behind the scenes to persuade the Carter administration to admit the shah, one of the bank’s most profitable clients. For Mr. Carter, for the United States and for the Middle East it was an incendiary decision. The ensuing hostage crisis enabled Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to consolidate his theocratic rule, started a four-decade conflict between Washington and Tehran that is still roiling the region and helped Ronald Reagan take the White House. To American policymakers, Iran became a parable about the political perils in the fall of a friendly strongman. Although Mr. Carter complained publicly at the time about the pressure campaign, the full, behind-the-scenes story — laid out in the recently disclosed documents — has never been told.  Mr. Rockefeller’s team called the campaign Project Eagle, after the code name used for the shah. Exploiting clubby networks of power stretching deep into the White House, Mr. Rockefeller mobilized a phalanx of elder statesmen.  They included Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state and the chairman of a Chase advisory board; John J. McCloy, the former commissioner of occupied Germany after World War II and an adviser to eight presidents as well as a future Chase chairman; a Chase executive and former C.I.A. agent, Archibald B. Roosevelt Jr., whose cousin, the C.I.A. agent Kermit Roosevelt Jr., had orchestrated a 1953 coup to keep the shah in power; and Richard M. Helms, a former director of the C.I.A. and former ambassador to Iran.  Charles Francis, a veteran of corporate public affairs who worked for Chase at the time, brought the documents to the attention of The Times. “Today’s corporate campaigns are demolition derbies compared to this operation,” he said. “It was smooth, smooth, smooth and almost entirely invisible.” Records of Project Eagle were donated to Yale by Mr. Reed, the campaign’s director. But he deemed the material so potentially embarrassing to his patron that Mr. Reed, who died in 2016, stipulated that the records remain sealed until Mr. Rockefeller’s death. Mr. Rockefeller died in 2017 at the age of 101.  Some of the information may embarrass others as well. Hawkish critics have often faulted Mr. Carter as worrying too much about human rights and thus failing to prop up the shah.  But the papers reveal that the president’s special envoy to Iran had actually urged the country’s generals to use as much deadly force as needed to suppress the revolt, advising them about how to carry out a military takeover to keep the shah in power.  A spokeswoman for Mr. Carter did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Carter at the time of the crisis was not immediately available. After the hostages were taken, the Carter administration worked desperately to try to free the captives, and on April 24, 1980, authorized a rescue mission that collapsed in disaster: A helicopter crash in the desert killed eight service members, whose charred bodies were gleefully exhibited by Iranian officials. The hostage crisis doomed Mr. Carter’s presidency. And the team around Mr. Rockefeller, a lifelong Republican with a dim view of Mr. Carter’s dovish foreign policy, collaborated closely with the Reagan campaign in its efforts to pre-empt and discourage what it derisively labeled an “October surprise” — a pre-election release of the American hostages, the papers show.  The Chase team helped the Reagan campaign gather and spread rumors about possible payoffs to win the release, a propaganda effort that Carter administration officials have said impeded talks to free the captives.  “I had given my all” to thwarting any effort by the Carter officials “to pull off the long-suspected ‘October surprise,’” Mr. Reed wrote in a letter to his family after the election, apparently referring to the Chase effort to track and discourage a hostage release deal. He was later named Mr. Reagan’s ambassador to Morocco.  Mr. Rockefeller then personally lobbied the incoming administration to ensure that its Iran policies protected the bank’s financial interests.  The records indicate that Mr. Rockefeller hoped for the restoration of a version of the deposed government.  At the start of the Iranian upheaval, the papers show, Mr. Kissinger advised Mr. Rockefeller that the probable conclusion would be “a sort of Bonapartist counterrevolution that rallies the pro-Western elements together with what was left of the army.” Mr. Kissinger, in a recent email, acknowledged that the prediction “reflects my thinking at the time” but said “it was a judgment, not a policy proposal.”  But Mr. Rockefeller evidently continued to advocate for some form of restoration long after the shah fled Tehran. As late as December 1980, Mr. Rockefeller personally urged the incoming Reagan administration to encourage a counterrevolution by stopping “rug merchant type bargaining” for the hostages and instead taking military action to punish Iran if the hostages were not released. He suggested occupying three Iranian-controlled islands in the Persian Gulf. “The most likely outcome of this situation is an eventual replacement of the present fanatic Shiite Muslim government, either by a military one or a combination of the military with the civilian democratic leaders,” Mr. Rockefeller argued, according to his talking points for meetings with the Reagan transition team. An heir to his family’s oil fortune, Mr. Rockefeller styled himself a corporate statesman and personally knew many White House officials, including Mr. Carter. He had known the shah since 1962, socializing with him in New York, Tehran and St. Moritz, Switzerland.  As Tehran’s coffers swelled with oil revenues in the 1970s, Chase formed a joint venture with an Iranian state bank and earned big fees advising the national oil company.  By 1979, the bank had syndicated more than $1.7 billion in loans for Iranian public projects (the equivalent of about $5.8 billion today). The Chase balance sheet held more than $360 million in loans to Iran and more than $500 million in Iranian deposits. Mr. Rockefeller often insisted that his concern for the shah was purely about Washington’s “prestige and credibility.” It was about “the abandonment of a friend when he needed us most,” he wrote in his memoirs.  His only advocacy for the shah, Mr. Rockefeller wrote, had been in a brief aside to Mr. Carter during an unrelated White House meeting in April 1979. “I did nothing more, publicly or privately, to influence the administration’s thinking.” Yet the Project Eagle papers show that Mr. Rockefeller received detailed updates on the risks to Chase’s holdings, and that even his aside to Mr. Carter in April had been planned out the previous day with Mr. Reed, Mr. McCloy and Mr. Kissinger. Over lunch at the Knickerbocker Club in New York, Mr. Carter’s special envoy to Tehran, Gen. Robert E. Huyser, told the Project Eagle team that he had urged Iran’s top military leaders to kill as many demonstrators as necessary to keep the shah in power. If shooting over the heads of demonstrators failed to disperse them, “move to focusing on the chests,” General Huyser said he told the Iranian generals, according to minutes of the lunch. “I got stern and noisy with the military,” he added, but in the end, the top general was “gutless.”  Mr. Rockefeller had his own special envoy to try to help the shah: Robert F. Armao, a Republican operative and public relations consultant who had worked for Mr. Rockefeller’s brother Nelson, the former governor of New York and former vice president.  Mr. Armao became one of the shah’s closest advisers, and after Nelson Rockefeller died at the start of 1979, he reported to the Project Eagle team at Chase nearly every day for more than two years. “Everybody had the hope that there would be a repeat of the 1953 events,” Mr. Armao recalled recently, referring to the American-backed coup that restored the shah the first time he fled. When the shah’s rule became untenable at the start of 1979, the State Department first turned to David Rockefeller for help relocating the Iranian monarch in the United States. “Not large enough for my very special client,” Mr. Reed wrote to a Greenwich, Conn., broker who had offered two estates priced at around $2 million each — about $7.4 million today. But while the shah tarried in Egypt and Morocco, an Iranian mob briefly seized the American Embassy in February. Diplomats warned that admitting the shah risked another assault, and Mr. Carter changed his mind about offering haven.  Mr. Rockefeller refused to deliver this bad news to the shah, afraid that it would hurt the bank by alienating a prized client. “The risks were too high relating to the CMB position in Iran,” he responded, referring to Chase Manhattan Bank, according to the records. Instead, Mr. Rockefeller scrambled to find accommodations elsewhere — first in the Bahamas, and then in Mexico — while strategizing with Mr. Kissinger, Mr. McCloy and others about how to persuade the White House to let in the shah.  During a three-day push in April, Mr. Kissinger made a personal appeal to the national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and a follow-up phone call to Mr. Carter. Mr. Rockefeller buttonholed the president at the White House.  And in a speech, Mr. Kissinger publicly accused the Carter administration of forcing a loyal ally to sail the world in search of refuge, “like a flying Dutchman looking for a port of call” — the seed of what became a “who lost Iran” campaign theme for the Republicans.  Mr. McCloy flooded the White House with lengthy letters to senior officials, often arguing about the danger of demoralizing other “friendly sovereigns.” “Dear Zbig,” he addressed his old friend Mr. Brzezinski.  Finally, in October, Mr. Reed sent his personal doctor to Cuernavaca, Mexico, “to take a ‘look-see’” at the shah. He had been hiding a cancer diagnosis. The doctor, Benjamin H. Kean, determined that the shah needed sophisticated treatment within a few weeks — in Mexico, if necessary, Dr. Kean later said he had concluded. But when Mr. Reed put the doctor in touch with State Department officials, they came away with a different prognosis: that the shah was “at the point of death” and that only a New York hospital “was capable of possibly saving his life,” as Mr. Carter described it at the time to The Times. With that opening, the Chase team began preparing the flight to Fort Lauderdale. “When I told the Customs man who the principal was, he almost fainted,” the waiting executive, Eugene Swanzey, reported the next morning. The plane’s bathroom was malfunctioning. The shah and his wife hunted in vain for a missing videocassette to finish a movie. And their four dogs — a poodle, a collie, a cocker spaniel and a Great Dane — jumped on everyone. The Great Dane “hadn’t been washed in weeks,” Mr. Swanzey said. “The aroma was just terrible.” When Mr. Reed met the plane on its final arrival in New York, he recalled the next day, the shah seemed to be thinking, “‘At last I am getting into competent hands.’”  But as he checked the shah into New York Hospital, Mr. Reed was circumspect. “I am the unidentified American,” he told the inquisitive staff. Mr. Reed, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Kissinger met again three days after the hostages were taken.  “Noted was the feeling of indignation as being high and nothing useful to say,” read the minutes.  The White House said the shah had to depart as soon as possible, but Project Eagle continued. “The ideal place for the Eagle to land,” Mr. Reed wrote to Mr. Armao on Nov. 9, forwarding a brochure for a 350-acre Hudson Valley estate.  A week later, Mr. Rockefeller personally urged Mr. Carter in a phone call to direct the secretary of state to meet with the shah about “the current situation.” Mr. Carter did not and the shah soon departed, for Panama, then Egypt.  Only after the death of the shah, on July 27, 1980, nine months after his landing in Fort Lauderdale, did the Project Eagle team shift to new objectives. One was protecting Mr. Rockefeller from blame for the crisis. Over roast loin of veal and vintage wine at the exclusive River Club in New York, Mr. Rockefeller and nine others on the team gathered on Aug. 19. Amid discussion of a laudatory biography of the shah by a Berkeley professor that the team had commissioned, some warned that a Rockefeller link to the embassy seizure would be hard to escape.  Why was the shah admitted? “Medical treatment/DR recommended,” one said, using Mr. Rockefeller’s initials, according to minutes of the dinner. “This association cannot be ignored.”  But Mr. Kissinger was reassuring. Congress would never hold an investigation during an election campaign. “I don’t think we are in trouble any more, David,” Mr. Kissinger told him. The hostages were released on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1981, and a few days later Mr. Carter’s departing White House counsel called Mr. Rockefeller to inquire about how the release deal affected Chase bank. “Worked out very well,” Mr. Rockefeller told him, according to his records. “Far better than we had feared.”   ']",The fateful decision in 1979 to admit Mohammed Reza Pahlavi prompted the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran and helped doom the Carter presidency.
