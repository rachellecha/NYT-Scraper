"Afghan Contractor Handed Out Russian Cash to Kill Americans, Officials Say",2020-07-01,"By Mujib Mashal, Eric Schmitt, Najim Rahim and Rukmini Callimachi","['KABUL, Afghanistan — He was a lowly drug smuggler, neighbors and relatives say, then ventured into contracting, seeking a slice of the billions of dollars the U.S.-led coalition was funneling into construction projects in Afghanistan. But he really began to show off his wealth in recent years, after establishing a base in Russia, though how he earned those riches remained mysterious. On his regular trips home to northern Afghanistan, he drove the latest model cars, protected by bodyguards, and his house was recently upgraded to a four-story villa. Now Rahmatullah Azizi stands as a central piece of a puzzle rocking Washington, named in American intelligence reports and confirmed by Afghan officials as a key middleman who for years handed out money from a Russian military intelligence unit to reward Taliban-linked fighters for targeting American troops in Afghanistan, according to American and Afghan officials. As security agencies connected the dots of the bounty scheme and narrowed in on him, they carried out sweeping raids to arrest dozens of his relatives and associates about six months ago, but discovered that Mr. Azizi had sneaked out of Afghanistan and was likely back in Russia. What they did find in one of his homes, in Kabul, was about half a million dollars in cash. American and Afghan officials have maintained for years that Russia was running clandestine operations to undermine the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and aid the Taliban. But U.S. officials only recently concluded that a Russian spy agency was paying bounties for killing coalition troops, including Americans, which the Kremlin and the Taliban have denied. According to officials briefed on the matter, U.S. intelligence officials believe the program is run by Unit 29155, an arm of the Russian military intelligence agency known as the G.R.U. that has carried out assassinations and other operations overseas. That a conduit for the payments would be someone like Mr. Azizi — tied to the American reconstruction effort, enmeshed in the regional netherworld, but not prominent enough to attract outside attention — speaks to the depth of Russia’s reach into the increasingly complicated Afghan battlefield, exploiting a nexus of crime and terror to strike blows with years of deniability. The public revelation last week of that conclusion has touched off a political firestorm in Washington. White House officials said at first that President Trump was never briefed on the matter, but it emerged that the intelligence assessment was included in a written briefing to the president in late February, if not earlier. As Democratic and Republican officials have expressed alarm at the news, and the administration’s lack of action in response, the White House has insisted that the information was uncertain. Details of Mr. Azizi’s role in the bounty scheme were confirmed through a dozen interviews that included U.S. and Afghan officials aware of the intelligence and the raids that led to it; his neighbors and friends; and business associates of the middle men arrested on suspicion of involvement. All spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation. U.S. intelligence reports named Mr. Azizi as a key middleman between the G.R.U. and militants linked to the Taliban who carried out the attacks. He was among those who collected the cash in Russia, which intelligence files described as multiple payments of “hundreds of thousands of dollars.” Those files were among the materials provided to Congress this week. Through a layered and complex Hawala system — an informal way to transfer money — he delivered it to Afghanistan for the missions, the files say. The transfers were often sliced into smaller amounts that routed through several regional countries before arriving in Afghanistan, associates of the arrested businessmen said. Afghan officials said prizes of as much as $100,000 per killed soldier were offered for American and coalition targets. Just how the money was dispersed to militants carrying out attacks for the Taliban, and at what level the coordination occurred, remains unclear. But officials say the network had grown increasingly ambitious and was in communication with more senior levels in Taliban military ranks to discuss potential targets. About six months ago, Afghanistan’s intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, raided the offices of several Hawala businessmen both in Kabul, the capital, and in Kunduz, in the north, who were believed to be associated with the bounty scheme, making more than a dozen arrests. “The target of the operation was Rahmat, who was going back and forth to Russia for a long time and said he worked there but no one knew what he did,” said Safiullah Amiry, the deputy head of Kunduz provincial council, referring to Mr. Azizi. But by the time the raid took place, “Rahmat had fled.” “From what I heard from security officials, the money had come from Russia through Rahmat,” he added. Russia was initially seen as cooperating with American efforts after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, as its interests in defeating Al Qaeda, an international Islamist terror group, aligned with those of the United States. But in recent years, as the two powers clashed elsewhere, the Kremlin grew wary of the prolonged United States presence and moved closer to the Taliban, hedging its bets on who would take power in a post-American Afghanistan. The Russians also saw an opportunity for long-awaited payback for the Soviet humiliation in Afghanistan in the 1980s, when the Red Army withdrew after being unable to defeat a United States-backed insurgency. Russia has walked a fine balance in recent years, eager to bloody the American nose, but wary of Afghanistan collapsing into a chaos that could spill over its borders. Publicly, Russia has admitted only to information-sharing with the Taliban in fighting the Islamic State in Afghanistan, a common foe. The U.S. conclusion in 2019 that the Russians were sending bounty money to the Taliban came at a delicate time in the conflict, just as the United States was deep into negotiations with the insurgents over a deal to withdraw the remaining American troops from the country. Some of the attacks believed to be part of the bounty scheme were carried out around the time the Trump administration was actively reaching out to Russia for cooperation on those peace talks. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy leading the talks, repeatedly met with Russian officials to build consensus around the American endgame. The Afghan battlefield is saturated with smaller terrorist groups in addition to the Taliban, who are still responsible for the majority of the violence. Criminal networks, profiteers and terror training experts also freelance their services — often to several groups at the same time. Mr. Azizi, who neighbors and relatives said is in his 40s, thrived in that convoluted, murky environment. A friend who has known him since his early days in Kunduz, as well as later in Russia, said he had started off with smuggling small shipments of drugs into Iran in his 20s, but that venture was not very successful. He had returned to northern Afghanistan, and somehow won contracts from the American-led coalition forces to build stretches of a couple roads in Kunduz, before making his way to Russia. None of those interviewed who know Mr. Azizi were surprised when his associates were raided about six months ago and one of his brothers taken into custody with the half a million dollars in cash. As one of his friends put it, he had gone from “not even having a blanket” to having multiple houses, fancy cars, and security escorts.

George Floyd’s Killing Prompts Africans to Call for Police Reform at Home,2020-07-03,"By Abdi Latif Dahir, Ruth Maclean and Lynsey Chutel","['NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenyan and American protesters knelt outside the United States Embassy in Nairobi one morning last month, outraged at George Floyd’s killing and the racism and brutality they saw across the Atlantic. But they were also furious about police abuses at home, in Kenya. Protests sprang up all over town. In the large slum of Kibera, in front of a large mural of Mr. Floyd, residents chanted, “Stop killing us.” In front of Parliament, youths carried caskets to protest extrajudicial killings. “The image of George Floyd’s death was so visceral, so violent,” said Lilly Bekele-Piper, an Ethiopian-American who lives in Kenya and brought her four children to the protests. “People came out because they recognize that violence in their own communities.” Outrage over Mr. Floyd’s death has rippled throughout the continent, with Africans invoking the Black Lives Matter movement to call attention to abuses in their own countries and demand that the police be held to account. The protesters also point to the enduring legacy of European rule. Many African countries’ police forces were established in the colonial era and, analysts say, are still used by governments as an instrument of repression and control. Sick of killings, torture and beatings meted out, citizens are increasingly trying to push governments to reform the abusive institutions they inherited from colonial rulers. As in the United States, greater scrutiny — often enabled and amplified by social media — has sometimes led to the police being held accountable for their actions. But there has been little attempt at systemic change. Africans have long feared the violent methods used by police forces on the continent, but their alarm has become more immediate in recent months as the new coronavirus has taken hold, and governments have used heavy-handed tactics to enforce lockdowns. At the onset of Kenya’s overnight curfew in March, officers enforcing the restrictions shot and killed 13-year-old Yassin Moyo while he stood on his family’s balcony. In late June, three people were killed in a small town in Kenya’s Rift Valley after a confrontation with the police over face masks. Nigerian police officers enforcing a curfew also fatally shot a teenager, Tina Ezekwe, in May at a bus stop in the West African country’s biggest city, Lagos. In Uganda, security forces were accused in late March of shooting at construction workers and beating vegetable vendors who had not shut their businesses. Ugandan activists, including the prominent academic Stella Nyanzi, were arrested in May while protesting the lack of food being distributed to those in need. The police in Zimbabwe were accused in May of abducting and sexually assaulting three female opposition activists, who were dumped along a remote roadside after protesting the government’s handling of a weekslong lockdown. But it was the activists who were later arrested, charged with lying about having been kidnapped and tortured. And in South Africa, the police watchdog said that law-enforcement and army officers had killed 11 people during the country’s strict lockdown. Hundreds of thousands of people have been charged with lockdown infringements in South Africa as part of what their lawyers say is an overzealous enforcement effort. Kenya’s security services have long been accused of carrying out killings, abductions and torture. Human rights organizations documenting disappearances and extrajudicial killings say that 707 people have been killed by the police since 2007 — 95 of them this year. The Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi is among those who have placed the abuses against a broader backdrop, calling for the police to be “decolonized” and retrained to safeguard people’s rights.  Police forces across the African continent were established by colonial rulers to “conquer, repress, and dominate” the people, said Ruth Joyce Kaguta, who teaches criminology and law at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Kenya. “They were not created for the people.” Most African countries gained independence in the 1960s, and their police forces are no longer foreign: Officers, superintendents and inspectors general are all citizens of the countries in which they work. But successive governments have not reformed the colonial-era police structures they inherited, so police cadets in some cases are still taught that members of the public are “enemy No. 1,” said Agatha Ndonga, the head of the Kenya office of the International Center for Transitional Justice. “They did not change the attitude and culture of policing,” she said. “They don’t look at us as persons whom they should protect.” Reform has been slow in Kenya and elsewhere on the continent, Ms. Kaguta said, largely because presidents since independence have seen that using the police to repress citizens can help them stay in power. In the early 1990s in South Africa, Nelson Mandela’s government did try to turn the apartheid government’s 11 abusive police agencies into a single entity aimed at serving communities. But by 2010, fatigued by violent crime, the police and the government “abandoned the language of service and returned to apartheid’s signifier of force,” said Andrew Faull, author of “Behind the Badge: The Untold Stories of South Africa’s Police Service Members.” Afraid of losing their jobs, officers did not challenge the culture. “Abuse of force was tacitly accepted by many, in part justified by a belief that many South Africans think ‘criminals’ deserve violent punishment,” Mr. Faull said in an interview conducted in writing. After Kenyan police killed protesters in the aftermath of disputed elections in December 2007, there were efforts at reform, but they were very limited. But the police today face greater public scrutiny as more people across the continent buy smartphones. They film, upload and watch videos of the police attacking civilians on Facebook and WhatsApp. These videos circulate so fast, Ms. Ndonga said, that “there’s no way they can deny it’s happening. And of course, it makes them have no choice but to go and now start conducting investigations.” Responding to the cases that catch the public’s attention can yield haphazard results. With many Kenyans calling for justice for Yassin Moyo, the 13-year-old killed on his balcony, the case moved exceptionally quickly: An officer was charged with murder and arraigned in court within weeks. In less famous cases, the process can take more than a year. When video circulated of law enforcement officials from Cape Town in South Africa violently evicting a naked man from his home, a shack they wanted cleared from a township, the officials responsible were suspended. But violent evictions of South Africa’s poorest Black citizens are common. In Nigeria, the police immediately announced an investigation into Tina Ezekwe’s killing, and said two officers had been arrested. But accountability is very rare for abusive police units in Nigeria, in particular the Special Anti-Robbery Squad that is tasked with fighting violent crimes, according to a new report from Amnesty International. In some cases, police forces facing criticism have doubled down. When a Gambian man was recently shot by the police in the United States, the government of the West African country called for an investigation. But when the activist Madi Jobarteh called for justice for victims of police brutality at home in Gambia, as well as in the United States, he was arrested. Some see hope for systemic change in the period of reflection that the protests over George Floyd’s killing have produced, in Africa as well as America. Besides Kenya, demonstrations against Mr. Floyd’s death and in solidarity with American protesters have taken place outside U.S. embassies in Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia. In Dakar, Senegal’s capital, 50 protesters took a knee in June while facing the Atlantic Ocean, America on its long-distant horizon. “Black lives in our country can feel unsafe,” said Ms. Bekele-Piper in Nairobi. “To me, these are vestiges of colonialism and now that we have the attention of the world, we have the chance to push against it.” Abdi Latif Dahir reported from Nairobi, Ruth Maclean from Dakar, Senegal and Lynsey Chutel from Johannesburg, South Africa.']",Africans are increasingly pushing to hold police agencies to account and “decolonize” the repressive institutions they inherited from colonial rulers.
When Police Are Hackers: Hundreds Charged as Encrypted Network Is Broken,2020-07-02,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — The police in Europe said Thursday they had arrested hundreds of people on suspicion of drug trafficking and other crimes after successfully hacking into an encrypted phone network being used by organized criminals around the world. The authorities said that by hacking into the network, the police were able to monitor criminal activity and communication as it was happening, allowing them to stop drug deals and even to prevent murder. Officials said in a statement that “millions” of messages were read in “real time, over the shoulder of the unsuspecting senders,” leading to arrests in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. “It was as though we were sitting at the table where the criminals were chatting among themselves, really,” said Jannine van den Berg, chief constable of the central police unit in the Netherlands, at a news conference in The Hague. “What makes this investigation unique is that at a large scale we managed to read all of these criminal messages live,” she said. The phone network that was used, known as EncroChat, provided specially altered phones — no camera, microphone, or GPS — for about $1,100. The phones allowed users to immediately erase compromising messages. The network also provided subscriptions with global coverage for about $1,600 over six months, even offering round-the-clock tech support. EncroChat, since shut down, “promised anonymity and complete secrecy to its users,” said Carole Etienne, a French prosecutor. The phones, she added, were “widely used throughout the world” by criminal organizations. “What seems to be possible only in thrillers and police shows, we actually have seen happen,” said Andy Kraag, head of the central investigations division in the Netherlands, which led the operation in collaboration with French authorities. “These messages that we captured give us a very detailed view of daily life in the criminal world,” Mr. Kraag said at the news conference. “We understand better who these people are and how they work.” Officials Thursday spoke in superlatives about the operation. The authorities had been monitoring the network for over two months before it was shut down, said Tina Hollevoet, a Europol spokeswoman. The data is still being analyzed and is expected to lead to “hundreds” of new investigations in the coming months. “What is really important for Europol is that we are kind of just getting started,” Ms. Hollevoet said. “In this initial phase the focus has been really on acting on those messages which contain live, threatening content, and the crimes that were really endangering people’s lives. But we still have so much data that is being analyzed, processed and transmitted to different countries.” The hacked messages and conversations were shared among the police in Europe through Europol. In Britain, the police made nearly 750 arrests, and seized $67 million in cash, 77 firearms and over two tons of drugs. The information was also used by the police in Sweden and Norway, leading to arrests in those countries as well. In the Netherlands, the police were able to make some 60 arrests as a result of the intercepted messages and to seize 22,000 pounds of cocaine, 154 pounds of heroin and 3,300 pounds of crystal methamphetamine, among other substances. They also dismantled 19 synthetic drug labs, seized 25 vehicles with “special compartments” and also “expensive watches,” according to a statement from Europol. The hacking “allowed authorities to detect and stop potential criminal activities,” said Ms. Etienne, the French prosecutor. “More than 100 criminal acts were picked up by Europol.” The investigation into EncroChat began in 2017, and it was initially focused on Lille, a city in the north of France, where the authorities discovered the presence of EncroChat servers. On June 13, the network sent out a warning to its users that it had been “infiltrated” by “governmental entities,” and advised customers to immediately get rid of their phones. “In many of our investigations, but also in other European countries, we were coming across a lot of criminals with EncroChat phones, and after a while that caught our attention,” said Maj. Gen. Jean-Philippe Lecouffe, of the French gendarmerie. “We realized that this network was used over 90 percent of the time by criminals to message each other and hide their communications from traditional police wiretapping techniques.” Ms. Hollevoet, the Europol spokeswoman, said the operation has provided deep insight into how organized crime functions, and described the level of detail that law enforcement was able to monitor over EncroChat as “unprecedented.” Aurelien Breeden contributed.']","The authorities said that by hacking into EncroChat, they were able to monitor criminal activity in real time, allowing them to stop drug deals and even murder."
What to Do When Children Interrupt TV News Interviews?,2020-07-02,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — It was a study in contrasts. In one instance, as an expert on global health policy was being interviewed on the BBC about coronavirus lockdowns in Britain on Monday, her daughter could be seen in the background dealing with a pressing question: Where should she display her unicorn drawing? The expert, Clare Wenham, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics, had been about to answer a question about Britain’s pandemic response when her daughter Scarlett came into the frame. After Dr. Wenham finished her answer, the presenter, Christian Fraser, asked what her daughter’s name was, and then suggested that the drawing should go on a lower bookshelf. “This is the most informative interview I’ve done all day,” he quipped at the end of the clip. In the other instance, the son of Sky News’s foreign affairs editor, Deborah Haynes, interrupted her to ask for two cookies while she was discussing former Prime Minister David Cameron on air. “I’m really sorry — that’s my son arriving,” Ms. Haynes said. “Sorry, I’m really embarrassed,” she added, before agreeing to her son’s request. The interview was cut off shortly after, and the presenter, Mark Austin, finished by saying, “OK, we will leave Deborah Haynes in full flow there with some family duties, but that’s what happens during lockdown and trying to report in lockdown.” Both segments were reminiscent of a BBC interview that went viral in 2017 after a professor was interrupted by his children and wife, and reflected the present reality that millions of people have been facing in recent months while working from home during the pandemic. Yet despite Mr. Austin’s acknowledgment that the situation has left many parents also juggling child care duties, Sky News’s handling of the interruption attracted disdain from viewers on social media while the BBC presenter’s approach drew praise. “Poor showing from @SkyNews,” Ashley Theophane, a professional boxer, wrote on Twitter. “No need to cut her off.” “Wonderful to see the realities of homeworking for parents,” Heather de Gruyther wrote on Twitter about the BBC interview. “And thank you to the presenter for making it OK and for talking to the child too.” Dan Smith, another Twitter user, said that it was likely that someone behind the scenes had asked the presenter to cut away, but that Sky News came across as embarrassed and aggressive. Mr. Austin offered his own assessment afterward. “I was keen to stay with it and find out which was the biscuit of choice,” the Sky News presenter wrote on Twitter, “but international affairs beckoned.” He later added that the interruption had been “the best bit” of the program. “Should have stayed with you,” he said.']","When children made cameo appearances on two live British news segments, one presenter engaged with the child, while the other interview was cut short.

Duterte Signs Antiterrorism Bill in Philippines Despite Widespread Criticism,2020-07-03,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte signed a contentious antiterrorism bill Friday aimed at combating Islamic militancy in the south, a measure that critics warned could lead to more widespread human rights abuses. Muslims living in the southern Philippines have spoken out against the legislation to broaden powers of arrest and detention. On Friday, a regional government in the southern island of Mindanao that includes former separatist rebels urged Mr. Duterte’s government not to go through with the measure. The new law allows for terrorism suspects to be detained without a warrant, prolongs the amount of time that they can be detained without being charged in court, and removes a requirement that the police present suspects before a judge to assess whether they have been subjected to physical or mental torture. Rights groups and activists say the new law is designed to give Mr. Duterte’s police and military forces more powers to stifle dissent against his populist rule amid his war on drugs, which has killed thousands of people. Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said the new law was necessary to crack down on terrorism. “Terrorism, as we often said, strikes anytime and anywhere,” Mr. Roque said. “It is a crime against the people and humanity. Thus, the fight against terrorism requires a comprehensive approach.” He stressed that terrorist acts in the Philippines had long “caused unimaginable grief and horror,” and added that the president and his legal team had carefully reviewed the legislation before he signed it into law. The law was signed days after the police and military forces killed four people believed to be Filipino militants linked to the Islamic State during a raid in Manila. The militants were suspected of working as financial conduits for the local branch of the Islamic State, according to the military. Officials said they were working with Mundi Sawadjaan, one of the accused plotters behind the January 2019 bombing of a Catholic cathedral on the southern island of Jolo that killed 23 people. The attack was carried out by an Indonesian couple wearing suicide vests. They were believed to have been directed by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, the leader of the Islamic State in the Philippines and Mundi Sawadjaan’s relative. On Friday, Edre Olalia, of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, said the group would challenge the “draconian law.” “This without a doubt is the most unpopular and perilous piece of legislation that could ever be pushed by a government that is fixated with the potion of power,” said Mr. Olalia, whose group represents activist and indigent groups. Human Rights Watch said the new law gave security forces the power to arrest activists, journalists and social media users by simply saying that they are suspected of terrorist activities. “The law threatens to significantly worsen the human rights situation in the Philippines, which has nose-dived since the catastrophic war on drugs began four years ago,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for the group. He said the law gave the green light for the “systematic targeting” of Mr. Duterte’s critics, as well as Filipinos who speak out against the his government. Human Rights Watch expressed particular concern with provisions that permit warrantless arrests and allow people to be kept for weeks in solitary detention, elements that Mr. Robertson said could facilitate torture. Earlier this week, Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, released a report that attributed thousands of “systematic” killings that were done with “near-total impunity” to Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs. “The campaign against illegal drugs is being carried out without due regard for the rule of law, due process, and the human rights of people who may be using or selling drugs,” she said. Ms. Bachelet cited “an unwillingness by the state to hold to account perpetrators of extrajudicial killings,” and had urged Mr. Duterte not to sign the antiterrorism bill, which she said blurred distinctions between what is criticism of the government and what is terrorism.']",Human rights groups say the new law will give the police and military forces more powers to stifle dissent.
"Netanyahu’s Annexation Day Arrives, but All That Emerges Is Delay",2020-07-01,By David M. Halbfinger,"['JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s push to annex territory in the occupied West Bank entered a critical window on Wednesday, but with his government divided, the White House indecisive and domestic opposition mounting, his allies said that a formal announcement could be weeks or even months away. International opposition is gaining steam, too: The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, added his name to the list of foreign leaders denouncing annexation, warning in a front-page op-ed in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot that it would be “contrary to Israel’s own long-term interests” and that his country would not recognize any such unilateral move. Mr. Netanyahu, seeking to cement his legacy, ran for re-election on a promise to impose Israeli sovereignty on as much as 30 percent of the West Bank, land that the Palestinians have long sought for a future state. His coalition agreement with Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief who nearly defeated him, allowed him to proceed with annexation no sooner than July 1. But that date came and went Wednesday without any clarification from Mr. Netanyahu about what he intends to annex. The scenarios that continue to be floated in the Israeli news media only raise new questions. The latest, described as a counterproposal by Mr. Netanyahu to the Trump administration’s original “conceptual map” for possible annexation, showed Jewish enclaves deep in Palestinian-designated territory growing, presumably to appease right-wing settlers who objected to being marooned inside a potential Palestinian state. But it also called for compensating the Palestinians by handing them some of the hills overlooking Ben-Gurion International Airport, which Israeli hawks had once considered too strategically vital to give away. Other options mentioned include annexing a small, purely symbolic area, taking the entire 30 percent or doing it in phases. The confusion appears to be hampering the government, too: A National Security Council officer told Israeli radio on Wednesday that Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet had yet to even meet to discuss the potential ramifications of annexation. Nor have the relevant security officials — including the army chief of staff, the commander of the West Bank division and the head of the Shin Bet internal-security agency — been looped into the discussions, Avigdor Liberman, a Netanyahu rival, said. Mr. Netanyahu himself signaled that Wednesday would be anticlimactic, saying a day earlier that he would be continuing to work on the annexation plan “in the coming days.” On Wednesday, Ofir Akunis, a Netanyahu ally and lawmaker, said annexation might have to wait till the end of July. And Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, another Netanyahu ally, said annexation could take “months.” But the window for a unilateral annexation could close in November if Mr. Trump is defeated: Israel would need American support, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has said he opposes such a move. At the moment, though, the political obstacles to following through on annexation are formidable. Some right-wing settlers are in revolt at the Trump peace plan’s contemplation of a Palestinian state of any kind on the West Bank. The White House sent emissaries to Jerusalem this week for a round of meetings on annexation that were described as inconclusive. The Trump administration has insisted that Mr. Netanyahu gain the agreement of Mr. Gantz, wanting to avoid having the former military leader accuse Mr. Trump of putting Israeli lives in danger while he is battling for re-election. That condition may be one reason for the delay. Mr. Gantz, who is now the defense minister, has opposed unilateral annexation. Mr. Gantz’s political support has plummeted since the election, over his promise-breaking alliance with Mr. Netanyahu despite the prime minister’s pending trial on corruption charges. But what remains of Mr. Gantz’s base is overwhelmingly opposed to annexation, so he is taking every opportunity to drag his feet: On Monday, he declared that “anything unrelated to the battle against the coronavirus will wait.” For his part, Mr. Netanyahu has threatened to break up the government and force a fourth election, which nobody in Israel wants, if Mr. Gantz does not fall in line, or to proceed on annexation without Mr. Gantz’s support. But Mr. Gantz is calling both bluffs. Mr. Gantz has more than his base on his side in arguing that Israel has bigger fish to fry: Polls show that ordinary voters care far less about annexation than the pandemic, the wheezing economy and a health system that was already overwhelmed before the virus hit. The July 1 date at least succeeded in mobilizing the loudest voices on the issue. Opponents took out four full-page ads in Haaretz, the left-leaning paper, on Wednesday and plastered the side of a skyscraper at the entrance to Jerusalem with a sign hectoring Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gantz and the Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi. Regavim, a settlers’ group, hung banners in the city showing a pensive Mr. Netanyahu and the slogan “History will judge,” with the words “Yes sovereignty” under a photo of Winston Churchill and “No Palestinian state” below that of Neville Chamberlain, the infamous appeaser of Hitler. Some who favor annexation, however, accused Mr. Netanyahu of promoting it as a cynical ruse to win a tight election and divert attention from his criminal trial. Mr. Liberman, a former defense minister who leads the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, said that Mr. Netanyahu’s failure to discuss the plan with security officials revealed his true motives. “For 14 months, the prime minister shouts and talks about applying sovereignty,” Mr. Liberman said Wednesday. “What turns out is that this whole move is not a move to apply sovereignty, but a public-relations move. Simply electoral theft. Nothing else.”']","Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, added his voice to the chorus of foreign leaders opposing any unilateral annexation of the occupied West Bank."
"In Hong Kong, Arrests and Fear Mark First Day of New Security Law",2020-07-01,By Vivian Wang and Alexandra Stevenson,"['HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police moved swiftly on Wednesday to enforce China’s new national security rules with the first arrests under the law, as the city immediately felt the chilling effect of Beijing’s offensive to quash dissent in the semiautonomous territory. The law was proving effective in tamping down the anti-government demonstrations that have wracked Hong Kong for more than a year. On Wednesday, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control — usually observed by huge pro-democracy marches — a scattered crowd of thousands protested, only to be corralled by the police and risk arrest for crimes that did not exist a day earlier. Deploying pepper spray and water cannons to force protesters off the streets, the police arrested about 370 people, including 10 over new offenses created by the security law that takes aim at political activity challenging Beijing. One of the 10 was a 15-year-old girl waving a Hong Kong independence flag, the police said. Far-reaching and punitive, the law threatens the freewheeling cultural scene and civil society that make the fabric of life in Hong Kong so distinct from the rest of China. While officials insist that the law will affect only a small group of offenders, many fear the government could use the law’s expansive definitions to target a wide array of people and organizations, prompting many to take defensive action. A museum that commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre is rushing to digitize its archives, afraid its artifacts could be seized. Booksellers are nervously eyeing customers, worried they could be government spies. Writers have asked a news site to delete more than 100 articles, anxious that old posts could be used against them. “You can say this law is just targeting protesters and anti-Chinese politicians, but it could be anyone,” said Isabella Ng, a professor at the Education University of Hong Kong who founded a charity that helps refugees in the city. “Where is the line to draw?” said Professor Ng, who worries that her charity could one day come under scrutiny. “Everything becomes very uncertain.” The law, which went into effect as soon as it was released Tuesday night, confirmed many residents’ fears that a range of actions that they had previously engaged in had become hazardous. Though the law specifically bans subversion, sedition, terrorism and collusion, its definitions of those crimes could be interpreted broadly to include various forms of speech or organizing. Lobbying foreign governments or publishing anti-Beijing viewpoints could be punished by life imprisonment in serious cases. So could saying anything seen as undermining the ruling Communist Party’s authority. In the mainland, the party has virtually eliminated independent journalism and imposed onerous restrictions on nongovernmental organizations. Citing the new law and other factors, the Trump administration is rolling back Hong Kong’s trade privileges with the United States. “Free Hong Kong was one of the world’s most stable, prosperous and dynamic cities,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a news conference on Wednesday. “Now it’ll be just another Communist-run city where its people will be subject to the party elite’s whims.” Even before the law was passed, activists, journalists, bookshop owners and professors said they had begun second-guessing any speech that could be labeled political. The human rights group Amnesty International said it had drawn up a contingency plan. Many Hong Kongers have expressed interest in emigration, a task that Britain has promised to make easier. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Wednesday that some Hong Kong residents would be allowed to live in Britain for five years — up from six months previously — and then apply for citizenship. A former British colony, Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy when it returned to Chinese control in 1997. It found success as a bridge between the mainland and the rest of the world, serving as a haven for Chinese dissidents and a base for academics, journalists and researchers to chronicle, unfettered, the country’s modernization. But reminders of Chinese control were never far away. The abductions of five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015 by the mainland authorities rattled others who had openly marketed salacious Chinese political thrillers or modern historical volumes. Though Hong Kong was long a sanctuary for books banned in the mainland, tighter border checks have recently choked the flow of books between Hong Kong and the mainland. Now the security push has accelerated panic and a sense of foreboding. “If you haven’t tasted what tyranny is, be prepared, because tyranny is not comfortable,” said Bao Pu, the founder of New Century Press, one of the city’s few surviving independent publishers. Albert Wan, the co-owner of Bleak House Books, an independent bookstore, said that he closely tracked all his book shipments, regardless of whether they could be considered political, watching for any sign of delay. He said that he had also grown wary of unfamiliar customers, and tries to decide if they are browsing for books or seemingly “building a profile” of him and his employees. “We are being paranoid,” Mr. Wan said. “I don’t know how else to put it.” For those who built their lives and livelihoods around Hong Kong’s unique freedoms, the security law has forced them to balance two seemingly irreconcilable goals: preserving their own safety, without giving in to fear. The June 4 Museum, which chronicles Beijing’s bloody military crackdown on student protesters in 1989, has not made plans to move its artifacts overseas for safekeeping. The Chinese government has tried to quash any memory of the massacre, so to hide the archives would be to admit premature defeat, said Lee Cheuk-yan, of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which runs the museum. But reality has also forced the alliance to start an online fund-raiser in support of digitizing the museum’s archives, which include video footage of the protests and letters that protesters wrote to their families. “We of course are racing with time,” Mr. Lee said. The chill is not limited to local groups. Large international organizations are also evaluating their future in the city. The new law specifically said that the government would “strengthen the management” of foreign nongovernmental organizations and news agencies. “The rule of law is going to come under very severe stress in Hong Kong,” said Nicholas Bequelin, the director for Amnesty’s East and Southeast Asia operations. Concerns about the security law’s reach have also forced many writers and protesters to scrutinize their digital footprints for anything that might now be deemed subversive. Activists deleted their accounts on Twitter and on Telegram, a messaging app popular with protesters. In recent weeks, around a dozen writers asked the editors of InMedia HK, a site that posts articles supporting democracy, to take down some or all of their archives, said Betty Lau, the site’s editor. Editors deleted more than 100 articles, Ms. Lau said. Hong Kong’s reputation for press freedom has long stood in contrast with the mainland’s censorship regime and routine harassment of journalists. But the new security law has thrown the future of the city’s lively news media into question. The Hong Kong News Executives Association, a group representing the top editors of the city’s major news outlets, expressed concern about the far-reaching impact of the security law ahead of its release. The Foreign Correspondents’ Club urged the government last week to guarantee that the authorities would not seek to interfere with the work of reporters. The government has not responded, but officials have sought to reassure the public that the city’s civil liberties will be protected. During a recent end-of-semester meeting at Hong Kong University’s Journalism and Media Studies Center, staff members wondered aloud where the red line would be and whether certain topics would be off limits, said the center’s director, Keith Richburg. “I’d be lying if I said I don’t think twice about posting something on Twitter before pushing the button,” said Mr. Richburg, a former foreign correspondent with The Washington Post. One of the starkest indicators that the national security law was already having its intended effect came on Tuesday, directly after lawmakers in Beijing unanimously approved it. Joshua Wong, the 23-year-old who is perhaps Hong Kong’s best-known activist, announced on social media that he would withdraw from Demosisto, the youth political group that he founded in 2016, citing fears for his safety. Demosisto, which has called for greater autonomy for Hong Kong, was for many the face of the protest movement’s future. Soon after, three other leading members of Demosisto also resigned. A few hours later, the group announced it was disbanding altogether. In a note explaining his decision, Mr. Wong wrote, “Nobody can be sure of their tomorrow.” The crowds of protesters were small on Wednesday, relative to the hundreds of thousands that regularly took to the streets last year. But swarms of riot officers quickly surrounded them. For some protesters, it’s a fight they are willing to continue, even if it means going up against Beijing. “We have to show the people of Hong Kong that we cannot be afraid or deterred by the national security law,” said Avery Ng, a leader of the League of Social Democrats, a political party. “We are taking a certain level of risk, being that one of our demands is the end of one-party dictatorship.” Austin Ramzy, Elaine Yu and Tiffany May contributed reporting. Bella Huang contributed research.']","Protesters deleted social media accounts, as formerly allowed speech suddenly became a potential crime.

Macron Replaces France’s Prime Minister in Bid to Reinvigorate His Government,2020-07-03,By Adam Nossiter and Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron shuffled prime ministers on Friday, removing the most popular member of his government and a potential rival in a bid to get a fresh start in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak that has hit France hard. Mr. Macron traded in his prime minister of three years, Édouard Philippe, for a relatively unknown technocrat, Jean Castex, who has helped guide France out of the health emergency. But the president has taken a chance in distancing himself from Mr. Philippe: The outgoing prime minister is the only French political leader to emerge from the health crisis with sharply enhanced credibility. By pushing out Mr. Philippe, Mr. Macron is testing the adage that, in politics, it is better to keep one’s rivals close at hand. Mr. Macron made the move in the face of an economic emergency brought on by the virus, by his own tenuous public support and by a surge in popularity for Green parties in local voting last Sunday. But Mr. Castex is not an environmentalist nor a leftist, suggesting Mr. Macron was not cowed by the election results nor by demands that he change his pro-business stance. The contemptuous reactions of French Greens and Socialists to Friday’s news suggested as much. By appointing Mr. Castex, the low-profile mayor of a modest town in the French Pyrenees who has shaped France’s so far successful strategy to ease lockdown restrictions, Mr. Macron is signaling that he is looking ahead. In doing so he is butting up against public opinion, though, as a new poll revealed this week that nearly 60 percent of the French wanted Mr. Philippe to stay in his post. That in itself was a problem for Mr. Philippe, as was his recent appearance on the cover of Paris Match as France’s real strongman. Mr. Macron “is very self-confident, he doesn’t want to be put in the shade by anybody,’’ said Gerald Grunberg, an emeritus political scientist at Sciences Po university. “He doesn’t want to be the president of Edouard Philippe’s government.” Replacing prime ministers, like firing managers in baseball, is a well-established tradition for modern French presidents looking to create new energy. Mr. Macron, 42, has two years to go in a rocky five-year term that has been marked by social unrest, some economic progress and, now, a shaky business outlook. G.D.P. is expected to drop 11 to 13 percent this year. For weeks, speculation about the fate of Mr. Philippe — who served an unusually long spell for a French prime minister — had swirled in the news media and in political circles. Mr. Macron had been expected to reshape his cabinet after the coronavirus dealt a heavy blow to France, hoping to give his government a fresh mandate in the last stretch of a five-year term that ends in 2022. “There had to be a new signal, a new conquest of the French, because we’ve lost so many,” said Patrick Vignal, a parliamentary deputy in Mr. Macron’s party from southern France. “So Emmanuel Macron was right to turn tables and name a new prime minister.” Mr. Grunberg noted that polls suggested Mr. Philippe could be the only political figure with enough standing to take on Mr. Macron in two years. Not a single other serious potential challenger has emerged on either the right or the left. Yet by the telling of the Élysée Palace, the seat of the French presidency, the parting was cordial, and the choice of Mr. Castex a natural one because he was seen as transcending the right-left divide, an intense focus of Mr. Macron. Mr. Castex, 55, is a graduate of the same elite finishing school for technocrats, the E.N.A., or National Management School, as both Mr. Macron and Mr. Philippe. Yet Mr. Macron’s supporters on Friday portrayed Mr. Castex as a son of the soil. “Jean Castex represents the Old World, a rural elected official who has had to face real problems,” Mr. Vignal said. “He’s a graduate of E.N.A., sure, but he’s got his feet in the muck, and his head in the stars.” Later on Friday, the Élysée announced that Mr. Philippe, who was re-elected mayor of Le Havre last weekend, would be given a new role in helping shape Mr. Macron’s Republic on the Move political movement. The reshuffle came the same day that French prosecutors announced that Mr. Philippe was one of three current or former officials under investigation for possible mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. But the process is in a very preliminary stage and might not lead to formal charges or trial. France is still dealing with the aftermath of the initial coronavirus outbreak, which has led to nearly 30,000 deaths in the country. France fared worse than Germany in deaths and cases, but considerably better than its northern and southern neighbors, including Britain. The shake-up was all the more expected after a strong showing by Green parties in France’s municipal elections last week, which intensified pressure on Mr. Macron to change his governing team. Mr. Macron’s party failed to field serious candidates in any of the major cities, a sign of its grass-roots weakness, and the Greens took Bordeaux, Lyon and Strasbourg. Unlike many of its European neighbors, France has a system of government in which the president, elected directly by the French people, is the head of the executive branch and is usually the main policy driver. The prime minister and cabinet are accountable to Parliament, but are appointed by the president and responsible for day-to-day governing. Mr. Philippe had won plaudits and popularity as a calm, steady presence during the initial wave of the virus. Where Mr. Macron lectured his countrymen in lofty, lengthy and martial declarations about France’s state of “war,” Mr. Philippe delivered unvarnished facts. He laid out the steps toward easing the country’s lockdown without sugarcoating the challenges or exaggerating the dangers. In an interview on Thursday with France’s regional press, Mr. Macron praised Mr. Philippe for helping him carry out “important historic reforms in circumstances that were often very hard” and said they had a special “relationship of trust.” “I will have choices to make to lead the new way,” Mr. Macron said of a cabinet reshuffle. He said that “there will be a new team,” suggesting that much of the cabinet could disappear along with Mr. Philippe. Mr. Philippe, 49, was a relatively unknown mayor of Le Havre, a port town in northern France, when Mr. Macron appointed him prime minister in 2017. He helped shepherd some of Mr. Macron’s most important and contested legislative efforts, especially the fiercely fought overhaul of France’s crazy-quilt pension system, which is still in the works. But Mr. Philippe is much more a man of France’s traditional right. “People like Edouard Philippe are very attached to balanced budgets,” said Mr. Grunberg, the political scientist. “Macron is not like that.”']","President Emmanuel Macron is reshaping his cabinet, starting with the removal of his popular prime minister, in a bid to give his government a fresh start in the last stretch of his term."
"The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix, Amazon and Stan in Australia in July",2020-07-02,By Noel Murray,"['Every month, streaming services in Australia add a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are our picks for July. JULY 1 The long-running docu-series “Unsolved Mysteries” debuted in 1987 and was canceled — for the first time — ten years later. Since then, the show’s been revived multiple times in multiple formats, as TV audiences have continued to clamor for authoritative-sounding reports on ghosts, UFOs, shadowy conspiracies and cold cases. Unlike its predecessors, the latest version lacks a host. It does features similar stories, rendered in a style that’s less punchy and more somber, similar to the modern true-crime documentaries already popular on Netflix. JULY 3 Anyone who grew up reading “The Baby-Sitters Club” series of young adult novels should be happy to hear that the new Netflix adaptation stays true to the books. The TV version is mostly episodic, telling short, tween-appropriate stories about a diverse group of middle-school classmates with strong personalities, who overcome their differences to run a child-care business in suburban Connecticut. This is not some edgy reimagining; it’s a bright, earnest, upbeat show about good kids. JULY 8 You don’t need to be a fan of the elaborately attired Puerto Rican astrologer Walter Mercado to enjoy the biographical documentary “Mucho Mucho Amor.” Before Mercado died late last year, a team of filmmakers enticed the flamboyant television personality to tell his story, all about how a love of theater and a few lucky breaks led to him becoming one of the most popular celebrities on Spanish-language TV for nearly 40 years. This doc doesn’t just cover the facts of its subject’s life; it also gets into how meaningful it was to see such a warmly positive, gender fluid character in the Latinx pop culture mainstream. JULY 10 The summer blockbuster movie season has been shut down due to COVID-19, but “The Old Guard” could help ease some of the feelings of withdrawal. Written by the veteran comic book creator Greg Rucka — and based on his 2017 Image Comics series — “The Old Guard” is an explosive science-fiction adventure, starring Charlize Theron as one of a select team of immortals who for centuries have hired themselves out as mercenaries. The picture was directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, who’s best-known for the sensitive and moving dramas “Love & Basketball” and “Beyond the Lights,” and who ought to have a unique take on the macho action genre. JULY 17 Katherine Langford plays the Arthurian “Lady of the Lake” in “Cursed,” an action-packed fantasy series that reframes the sword-and-sorcery legend from the perspective of the sorceress Nimue. Based on a young adult novel by the show’s producer Tom Wheeler (whose creative partner in both the book and the TV series is the comic book artist Frank Miller), “Cursed” has the look and heft of series like “Game of Thrones.” But it’s less grim in its depiction of this heavily stratified society, challenged by a woman who’s often underestimated by the powers that be. JULY 24 The 2018 movie adaptation of Beth Reekles’ young adult novel “The Kissing Booth” (written when the author was still a teenager) overcame some savage reviews to become one of Netflix’s most buzzed-about romantic comedies. The sequel, “The Kissing Booth 2,” is also based on a Reekles book, written roughly a decade later. The story picks up where its predecessor left off, with Elle Evans (Joey King) trying to keep a long-distance relationship going with the college-bound Noah Flynn (Jacob Elordi). Complications ensue, as Noah befriends a female classmate while Elle becomes attracted to a new boy in school. Also arriving: “Berlin Syndrome” (July 1), “Deadwind” Season 2 (July 1), “Grease” (July 1), “Pitch Perfect” (July 1), “Say I Do” (July 1), “Top End Wedding” (July 1), “Warrior Nun” (July 2), “Cable Girls” Final Season: Part 2 (July 3), “Desperados” (July 3), “Ju-On: Origins” (July 3), “Southern Survival” (July 3), “Japan Sinks: 2020” (July 9), “The Protector” Season 4 (July 9), “The Claudia Kishi Club” (July 10), “O Crush Perfeito” (July 10), “The Twelve” (July 10), “The Business of Drugs” (July 14), “Urzila Carlson: Overqualified Loser” (July 14), “Fatal Affair” (July 16), “How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast)” Season 2 (July 21), “Jack Whitehall: I’m Only Joking” (July 21), “Fear City: New York vs. the Mafia” (July 22), “Norsemen” Season 3 (July 22), “Good Girls” Season 3 (July 26), “Last Chance U: Laney” (July 28), “The Hater” (July 29), “The Speed Cubers” (July 29), “The Umbrella Academy” Season 2 (July 31). JULY 3 The second season of the character-driven cat-and-mouse thriller “Hanna” moves beyond the narrative confines of the 2011 movie that inspired it. Now out on her own — after losing the only father she’s ever known — Hanna (Esme Creed-Miles) uncovers more information about a secret organization that molds girls and young women like her into deadly super soldiers. As with season one, “Hanna” season two is loaded with stylish action sequences. But its story remains centered on a heroine with a complicated past, belatedly discovering her own humanity. JULY 11 Even if the 2020 movie schedule hadn’t been curtailed, “Vivarium” would still be one of this year’s most captivating horror films. Surreal and satirical, the movie follows an above-it-all young couple named Gemma and Tom — played by Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg — who go house-hunting in suburbia and end up trapped in a generic, maze-like subdivision. Soon, some mysterious overlords force Gemma and Tom to raise an obnoxiously demanding and unlovable child, as the film develops into a nightmarish exaggeration of marriage and parenthood. JULY 24 The comic book artist and filmmaker Marjane Satrapi (best known for her memoir “Persepolis”) tries something different with her latest movie, a biopic starring Rosamund Pike as the Nobel Prize-winning chemist and physicist Marie Curie. Based on a Lauren Redniss graphic novel, and adapted to the screen by the writer Jack Thorne, “Radioactive” covers the basic facts of Curie’s life including her relationship with her husband and partner Pierre Curie (Sam Riley). But it also takes a big-picture perspective, showing how Curie’s influence rippled through the world in ways both beautiful and destructive. Also arriving: “The Weekend” (July 15), “Absentia” Season 3 (July 17), “Jim Gaffigan: The Pale Tourist” (July 24). JULY 5 The five-part true-crime series “Outcry” covers the case of Greg Kelley, a former Texas high school football player whose promising career was cut short when he was convicted of sexually assaulting a four-year-old boy. The charge is heinous, but the series posits that the prosecution may have been hasty. The documentarian Pat Kondelis explores what happened after some people in the community started rallying on Kelley’s behalf, and considers whether the nature of the crime itself made it more difficult to get a definitive answer about what happened. JULY 10 Well-received at the Sundance Film Festival when it debuted earlier this year, the supernatural horror film “Relic” stars Emily Mortimer and Bella Heathcote as a mother and daughter who become concerned when the aging matriarch of their family, Edna — played by Robyn Nevin — begins to show signs of dementia. When the younger women arrive at Edna’s dark, creaky old house to lend a hand, they wonder if what’s really bothering grandma is something supernatural. The first-time feature filmmaker Natalie Erika James builds tension through quiet scenes of everyday life, made more ominous by the circumstances. JULY 12 Based on a Katori Hall stage play, the provocative drama “P-Valley” is set among the staff and clientele of a small town strip club, located deep in the American south. The emphasis here is less on cheap thrills than on complicated characters — male and female — who each have rich pasts informing their reasons for coming to this place. Each of the first season’s directors is a woman, and while sex and desire are certainly elements of this show, they inform a much larger story. JULY 31 With “The Trip to Greece,” Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon continue one of the most delightful film series in recent memory: a mostly improvised travelogue in which the two comic actors play exaggerated versions of themselves. As the title implies, in this chapter the boys tour the Greek isles, following the path of Homer’s “Odyssey” while stopping to eat at the finest restaurants. As always, the two also try to outdo each other with both their celebrity impressions and their wry comments about ancient culture. Also arriving: “Dead Pixels” Season 1 (July 1), “Brooklyn” (July 2), “The Illusionist” (July 2), “Apocalypto” (July 3), “Military Wives” (July 3), “Killing Time” Season 1” (July 6), “Sing Street” (July 7), “Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted to You” (July 8), “The Edge of Seventeen” (July 9), “Aniara” (July 10), “Bates Motel” Seasons 1-5 (July 10), “Flea-bitten!” Season 1 (July 10), “12 Years a Slave” (July 13), “The Returned” Season 1 (July 16), “The Piano” (July 17), “Valley Girl” (July 17), “Love & Mercy” (July 19), “Devils Dust” (July 22), “Wonderland” Seasons 1-3 (July 23), “Spin City” Seasons 1-6 (July 24), “Zomboat” Season 1 (July 24), “Hearts and Bones” (July 26), “The Bling Ring” (July 27), “Paul Hollywood Eats Japan” (July 31).']","Our picks for July, including ‘Unsolved Mysteries,’ ‘The Old Guard’ and ‘Vivarium’"
A Lost Dog’s Brief Stint as Brazil’s Presidential Mascot,2020-07-01,By Ernesto Londoño,"['Judging from his Instagram account, Augusto Bolsonaro, a playful Maremma sheepdog, was living his best life. Soon after a guard at the presidential palace in Brazil spotted the friendly white dog roaming the streets last month, he took him in. The pup wasted no time ingratiating himself in the highest echelons of power: Before long, he was introduced as the official mascot of President Jair Bolsonaro’s family. “My new home,” was the caption of the first post on the presidential dog’s Instagram account, which debuted in late June. Sporting a black vest with the Brazilian flag, Augusto looked radiant. In the days that followed, he wooed the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, who gave him free rein of the president’s home. He played fetch in the garden, was allowed on the sofas and slept in the bedroom of Letícia Firmo, Mrs. Bolsonaro’s teenage daughter from a previous relationship. In his brief stint as the First Mascot, Augusto racked up thousands of Instagram followers.  Mr. Bolsonaro, a strident populist, was elected on promises to crack down on crime and corruption, and has proven a divisive figure. As Brazil faced the pandemic, he has denied the virus’ severity and refrained from measures that have proven elsewhere to curb the disease’s spread.  The tale of the lost dog finding a new gilded home was the rare development in the capital, Brasília, that did not become politicized, angrily debated or litigated. But from the start, there were clues that his reign might be short-lived. “We had an inkling he wasn’t a street dog,” the first lady said in a live story video she recorded on the dog’s account. “We had a sense the owners might turn up.” Becoming internet famous likely hastened the end of Augusto’s tenure as the presidential pet. The dog’s owner, Nagib Lima Zeidan, had had a pretty rotten year, having lost his job at a gas station in recent months, and then his beloved dog, whose real name is Zeus. “I was very sad when I learned he had run away,” Mr. Lima, 25, told the Brazilian magazine ÉPOCA. “You end up loving animals a lot because they are so protective and affectionate.” So Mr. Lima was thrilled — and stunned — to learn what his dog had been up to during his days off the leash. After seeing the Instagram account, Mr. Lima got in touch with the Bolsonaro family and sent them photos of Zeus back when he had led a more pedestrian life. The Bolsonaro family invited Mr. Lima to the palace to pick up Zeus, and returned him during a low-key ceremony on Tuesday, which the president attended. It was hard to know whether Zeus had mixed feelings about giving up the fancy residence and title. But he pressed his paws onto Mr. Lima and gave him a big kiss when the owner walked into the palace. In a deeply polarized nation, Mr. Lima saw fit to make clear that he doesn’t support any political party. “I’m very grateful to the president and his family for having taken such good care of my puppy,” he said. Mrs. Bolsonaro said the owner had suggested that they could perhaps share custody. “He found his way into our heart,” she said of the dog. “There was a lot of joy when Augusto was reunited with his owner, but also many tears.” Letícia Casado contributed reporting from Brasília.']","A white dog, found near the presidential palace, soon became the presidential mascot, and an Instagram star.

The Theatrical Method in Putin’s Vote Madness,2020-07-01,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Russia’s seven-day national plebiscite, intended to keep President Vladimir V. Putin in power until at least 2036, delivered the expected verdict on Wednesday: Early results showed that three-quarters of voters had given their endorsement. Less clear, however, was why Mr. Putin even needed voters to approve a raft of constitutional amendments that, already ratified by the national parliament in Moscow and regional legislatures across the country, entered into law months ago. “From a juridical point of view, this whole exercise is insane,” said Greg B. Yudin, a sociologist and political theorist at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences. But, he added, “it is not at all a meaningless procedure,” because Russia’s system under Mr. Putin depends on the appearance of popular support to confer legitimacy on decisions he has already made. “It is theater, but very important and well-played theater. The system needs to stage displays of public support even when it doesn’t have it,” Mr. Yudin said. “This vote is putting Putin’s theatrical techniques to the test.” In a final melodramatic flourish on Tuesday, Mr. Putin addressed the nation against the backdrop of monuments to Soviet soldiers killed fighting Nazi Germany, assuring voters that their voices mattered, no matter that the scores of amendments they were being asked to consider had already been enacted and the amended constitution had been published and put on sale in book stores. “The voice of each of you is the most important, the most significant,” Mr. Putin said. Voters, in theory, could have rejected the amendments, and Mr. Putin pledged to honor their decision. But the chances of that happening always seemed minuscule, not least because of what Golos, an independent election monitoring organization, described on Tuesday as an electoral process rigged from the start. Golos said the vote, unfairly skewed by a noisy one-sided propaganda campaign by state-controlled media and blatant pressure from a sprawling galaxy of state-funded companies and organizations, did “not allow us to talk seriously about the possibility of the will of the people being expressed.” The state’s vast reach and resources allowed it to mobilize people like Lyudmila Savinkina, the editor in chief of Yegoryevsk Today, a small state television station in a town southeast of Moscow. In a recording obtained by Golos, she ordered her staff not only to vote but to make sure they voted in the town of Yegoryevsk, no matter where they are usually registered. (Local officials risk losing their jobs if they fail to mobilize enough voters in their own districts.) For those who disobeyed, the editor told her staff, there would be consequences. Those, she said, “may vary, I’m just warning you. And this concerns both you and me. I will not even explain it to you. Everyone can lose jobs, bonuses — and this amid a pandemic, when many people have already lost their jobs.” Ms. Savinkina did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment. For weeks, a long parade of prominent Russians who depend on the state for their positions and income — from actors and musicians to the head of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church — have paraded across state television urging people to vote. Curiously, none of them mentioned the core of the exercise: an amendment to allow Mr. Putin to crash through constitutional term limits in place since 1993 and stay in power virtually for life, rather than step down at the end of his current term in 2024. They instead focused on other changes, like enshrining the protection of pensions, family values, animals, the Russian language and the memory of Russians killed in World War II. The yes-or-no vote was a package deal, which meant that anyone who believed in the sanctity of Russia’s war dead — a huge number in a country that lost more than 20 million lives during what was known as “the Great Patriotic War” — would most likely tick yes and, in doing so, endorse the idea of letting Mr. Putin, now 67, stay in the Kremlin at least until age 83. Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, denounced the exercise as a “shameful farce” that had been “specially designed to cheat and deceive the public.” Mr. Navalny fired his most vitriolic comments at the mostly over-the-hill celebrities who, reliant on state-funded gigs, had joined a feverish campaign to get out the vote. He called them “revolting, vile and disgusting people” who “are lying, cheating the public for money.” One of his targets was Oleg Gazmanov, a singer often hired to entertain officials, including Mr. Putin at a celebration honoring secret police officers. In his pitch to voters on television, Mr. Gazmanov made no mention of Mr. Putin staying in power for 16 more years but stressed the importance of voting to prevent “trampling on the memory of our heroes, desecrating the graves of our ancestors.” He recalled that his own father had fought all the way to Berlin in 1945. By contrast, many bloggers, “influencers” and other internet celebrities turned down payments to mention the amendments, fearing that any hint of praise for Mr. Putin would ruin their image with their young audiences and crush ad sales. The Central Election Commission reported on Wednesday morning, at the start of the final day of voting, that 55 percent of Russia’s 108 million registered voters had already cast their ballots. The turnout alone validated the success of Mr. Putin’s extravagant show. By late Wednesday, with 98 percent of ballots counted, 78 percent of voters backed the constitutional amendments, election officials said. That nearly matched earlier exit poll results from the state-controlled Russian polling organization, VTsIOM, that showed 76 percent of voters backing the amendments. The foregone nature of the outcome, in Mr. Yudin’s view, reflects Russia’s “plebiscitary democracy,” a system that revolves around a single, unchallenged leader but still requires regular cries of “public acclamation to give it legitimacy.” The Kremlin’s primary objective, he said, was less to get public approval for amendments that had already been ratified than to give Mr. Putin a fresh jolt of legitimacy at a time when, with Russia’s economy severely damaged by the coronavirus pandemic, his approval rating has slumped to its lowest level since he came to power 20 years ago. To ensure that happened, the Kremlin pulled out all the stops. Voters were lured to polling stations by prize lotteries, grocery vouchers, clown shows and other attractions. There were scattered reports of outright fraud, but more significant was the forced mobilization of the large number of voters whose livelihood depends, one way or another, on staying on the Kremlin’s good side. Employees at state-funded libraries in St. Petersburg complained that they had been ordered by their institutions to vote and on which day. Boris L. Vishnevsky, a St. Petersburg academic and opposition member of the local council, described this as a “gross violation of labor law,” saying that “employees have no obligation to vote if they don’t want to.” Some people balked, like Vladimir Zhirinov, a young journalist who said this week that he was resigning from a state television station in the Siberian city of Krasnoyars, because “what is happening is beyond my comprehension.” “I cannot just nod: ‘Yes, everything has already been decided, nothing depends on us,’” he said. In the final days of the vote, officials and state media outlets went on the offensive against claims of fraud posted on social media, some of which were clearly fake. One of those showed ballot papers pre-marked with invisible ink that later became visible. The clip was filmed during an election years ago in Kazakhstan.

"Harsh Penalties, Vaguely Defined Crimes: Hong Kong’s Security Law Explained",2020-07-01,By Javier C. Hernández,"['The sweeping new national security law that China imposed on Hong Kong, aimed at stamping out opposition to the ruling Communist Party in the former British colony, is as “devastating” as some critics feared, a human-rights activist said on Wednesday. Conceived in secrecy and passed on Tuesday without serious input from Hong Kong authorities, the law sets up a vast security apparatus in the territory and gives Beijing broad powers to crack down on a variety of political crimes, including separatism and collusion. In what initially appeared to be an early test of the law, a man was arrested on Wednesday after he unfurled a Hong Kong flag during demonstrations and the police said on Twitter that he had been detained for “violating the #NationalSecurityLaw.” It was “the first arrest made since the law has come into force,” the police said. But a closer look at the banner appeared to show words that translated to “No to” in small letters and “Hong Kong Independence” in bigger type. It was unclear if the police were aware. The law is likely to usher in a new era for Hong Kong, experts say, in which civil liberties are tightly constrained and loyalty to the party is paramount. “All in all, this is a takeover of Hong Kong,” said Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who specializes in the Chinese legal system. Here’s a guide to the new rules. The security law, which includes 66 articles and more than 7,000 words, takes direct aim at the spirited antigovernment protests that have convulsed Hong Kong over the past year, prescribing harsh penalties for the tactics commonly used by demonstrators. As they led a monthslong campaign last year to resist what they called Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s civil liberties, protesters worked to disrupt the city’s reputation for efficiency and orderliness. Some groups attacked police stations, vandalized shops and restaurants and briefly paralyzed the airport. Under the new law, damaging government buildings would be considered an act of subversion punishable by life imprisonment in “grave” cases. Sabotaging transport would be deemed a terrorist activity punishable by life in prison if it harms other people or causes significant damage to public or private property. The four major offenses in the law — separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign countries — are ambiguously worded and give the authorities extensive power to target activists who criticize the party, activists say. “This law is to punish a tiny number of criminals who seriously endanger national security — a sharp sword hanging high over their heads that will serve as a deterrent against external forces meddling in Hong Kong,” Zhang Xiaoming, a deputy director of the central Chinese government office for Hong Kong, said at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday. Mr. Zhang said that a separate legal system under mainland laws would be used for some of the most serious and imminent national security cases. But he did not specify whether this could be done by bringing mainland prosecutors, judges and prison guards to Hong Kong or by extraditing prisoners to mainland China. “The law is devastating in that it appears to have no bounds,” said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch. “Hong Kong activists, accustomed to operating in mostly rights-respecting environment, now face a frightening void.” Hong Kong’s residents have long cherished the city’s independent judiciary, a legacy of British colonial rule that stood in stark contrast to the secretive, party-controlled courts in mainland China. Under the security law, however, Beijing has given itself wide latitude to interfere in Hong Kong’s legal affairs, insulated from scrutiny by local courts and lawmakers. The legislation will install in Hong Kong a formidable network of security forces answering to Beijing. They include a national security committee in the Hong Kong government and a national security office made up of mainland Chinese officers stationed in Hong Kong and handling cases according to mainland Chinese law. Under the legislation, the central government in Beijing can intervene in national security cases, especially during crises or if a case is deemed “complex.” The law opens the way for defendants in important cases to stand trial before courts in mainland China, where convictions are usually assured and penalties are often harsh. Trials involving state secrets could be closed to the news media and the public. The law could bring to Hong Kong many harsh legal practices common in mainland China, experts said. Broadly, the law says that the rights of suspects and defendants in national security cases should be respected. But apart from a presumption of innocence and the right to defend oneself, it does not offer much clarity on those protections, leaving open the danger that some of the harsh, unaccountable practices common on the mainland could spread to Hong Kong. “As a national security suspect, you can be locked up for as long as six months incommunicado, subject to torture, coerced confession, no access to counsel or family or friends, before the police decide whether to process you for a crime,” said Mr. Cohen, the law professor, speaking about practices common in mainland China. Beijing has repeatedly sought to portray the unrest in Hong Kong as the work of foreign countries, especially the United States, accusing them of taking part in a plot to sow chaos in China and topple the Communist Party. Chinese officials have spread unfounded conspiracy theories suggesting that Western countries are funding and directing the activists. Several parts of the security legislation take aim at the perceived role of foreigners in political activism in Hong Kong. The new rules apply even to those who are not residents of Hong Kong, with Article 38 suggesting that foreigners who support independence for Hong Kong or call for imposing sanctions on the Chinese government could be prosecuted upon entering Hong Kong or mainland China. The law also states that national security officials in Hong Kong will “take necessary measures to strengthen the management” of foreign nongovernmental organizations and news outlets in the territory. And, the legislation does not offer specifics. The legislation seems to be aimed at silencing criticism of the party’s policies in Hong Kong among rights activists, journalists and government officials outside China, experts said. “The law’s broad extraterritorial scope could well have a chilling effect on overseas NGOs, limiting their ability to partner with Hong Kong groups on sensitive issues like human rights and political reform,” said Thomas E. Kellogg, executive director of the Center for Asian Law at Georgetown University. Mr. Kellogg said that more restrictions on nongovernmental groups working on issues like human rights, the rule of law and the democratic development in Hong Kong were likely to emerge in the coming months. The provisions targeting foreigners will most likely worsen tensions between China and the United States, with relations already at their lowest point in decades. The Trump administration has promised a series of punishments in retaliation for the national security legislation, including visa restrictions and limits on exporting defense technology. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the passage of the legislation, tweeting: “The CCP’s draconian national security law ends free Hong Kong and exposes the Party’s greatest fear: the free will and free thinking of its own people.” He also said in a statement, “The United States will not stand idly by while China swallows Hong Kong into its authoritarian maw.” Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley contributed reporting.

Australia Faces Its Own Reckoning Over Diversity in Media,2020-07-03,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Besha Rodell, a columnist for the Australia bureau. In the 1980s, my mother was a reporter in Melbourne, where much of her work focused on the Indigenous communities in Victoria. She recently told me about a time when she went to her editors at The Age and suggested that they actively seek out and recruit young Indigenous reporters because — while she felt she had earned the trust of her sources — their stories would be better told by people from that community. Hiring a more diverse staff, she explained, would be better for journalism and better for the newspaper. She did not get the response she hoped for. “They looked at me like I had two heads,” she said. Last month, echoing her experience, a group of more than 60 journalists at The Age wrote a letter to their top editors and executives of the Nine corporation, which now owns The Age, expressing distress with a number of issues at the paper, including its lack of diversity. “As far as we are aware the Age has had only one Indigenous reporter in its 166-year history,” they wrote. “Every editor in the Age’s history has been a white man, as is every current foreign correspondent.” The Age is not the only media institution in Australia reckoning with a lack of diversity. A group of journalists have written a letter calling for more diversity on Melbourne Press Club’s all-white board. Australia’s public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, have come under fire in recent weeks, with a number of nonwhite journalists describing incidents of racism at SBS — a station with diversity as a central part of its mission, but with a leadership team that does not reflect that mandate. It’s one of the many ways that the Black Lives Matter movement in the U.S. has inspired Australians to examine issues of race in our own country. Large protests in Australian cities supported Black Americans demanding justice after the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, while also calling attention to Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. And within media and culture, calls for diversification just keep rippling through the landscape. I have barely slept in recent weeks, trying to keep up as Bon Appétit’s editor in chief Adam Rappaport resigned over various accusations of racism, and as people called for the resignation of John T. Edge, director of the influential Southern Foodways Alliance. (I have written for Bon Appétit in the past and was a speaker at a Southern Foodways Alliance symposium in 2015 as well as having written for its magazine, Gravy.) Australian food media is likely due for its own reckoning. I was contacted this week by a group of freelance writers who are hoping to diversify the voices and content represented in Australian food media, and are aiming to put specific plans in place to achieve that goal. I keep thinking about my mother’s experience in the ’80s, and how different our media might look now if any of her former editors had heeded her call to actively seek out and recruit reporters from within the communities she was covering. I’m sure she was not the only one to suggest such a thing, and it’s entirely possible that the media landscape would have been so difficult and hostile for nonwhite journalists that the difference would be minimal. But if there had been a concerted effort to engage, hire, retain and support a diverse range of journalists 30 years ago, Australian media would surely be far better for it today.

26 Killed at Drug Rehab Center in Mexico’s Most Violent State,2020-07-02,By Natalie Kitroeff and Paulina Villegas,"['MEXICO CITY — Armed men stormed into a drug rehabilitation facility in central Mexico on Wednesday, killing 26 men and gravely wounding five others, in what the authorities said could be part of a fight over territory between rival criminal organizations. The gunmen entered the rehabilitation center in Irapuato, in the state of Guanajuato, forced everyone to the ground and shot them, the local secretary of security said. Guns were found at the scene and a photo published by local media showed a cluster of men lying face down in what appeared to be a pool of blood. “There is a turf war in the state between the Santa Rosa cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel,” said Elihú Ojeda, a spokesman for the state prosecutor’s office, in an interview. “We have had a series of events of this type.” The assault was the latest in a string of high-profile attacks across Mexico, where the government’s inability to curb rising violence has become a national crisis and a political liability for the president. While many Latin American countries have enjoyed a respite from daily criminality during coronavirus lockdowns, in Mexico, homicides have kept climbing. With more than 3,000 homicides, March was the deadliest month in Mexico since President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office in 2018. The wave of violence has devastated Guanajuato, a center for automotive manufacturing and home to the city of San Miguel de Allende, a tourist draw and home to many American retirees. The state, northwest of Mexico City, averages 12 homicides a day, the highest murder rate in the country. “The situation Guanajuato is facing is very serious,” Mr. López Obrador said in a news conference on Thursday. “There is fighting between gangs, and in the majority of cases it’s aggression between them.” The president said he wanted to determine “whether there is conspiracy or a criminal association between the authorities and delinquent groups.” For the last several years, the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, a criminal group focused on oil theft, has been fighting with the larger Jalisco New Generation Cartel for control over lucrative illicit enterprises in Guanajuato, including drug trafficking. That battle has contributed to thousands of casualties across the state, as homicides more than tripled over the last five years, including several cases of mass killings. But the attack on the rehabilitation center, called “Recovering My Life,” one of many facilities across the country providing services to addicts without authorization from state authorities, was particularly lethal, even by the standards of the nation’s most violent state. “We have had events like this all over the state where they shoot at shops, small businesses, private homes where they go in looking for someone, but none of this magnitude,” Mr. Ojeda said. Last week, Mexican authorities arrested the mother and sister of the leader of the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, escalating the tensions between the government and organized crime. Eduardo Guerrero Gutiérrez, a security analyst at Lantia Consultores in Mexico City, said that Wednesday’s attack was likely an attempt by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel to hit their rivals at a moment of vulnerability. “They smell blood and know that their rival is weak,” Mr. Guerrero said. “So it’s a good moment to launch a more aggressive offensive and possibly finish them off.” It is not known how many, if any, of the victims at the rehabilitation center had ties to organized crime. Local news reports quoted the mother of one of the killed men, who said that her son was there seeking treatment and had nothing to do with the cartels. Men seeking treatment for drug addiction have become common targets of mass shootings across the country, in what security experts believe may be attempts at score settling between rival gangs. Just last week, gunmen killed 10 people in a different drug treatment center in Irapuato. “These are places where the men seeking treatment are often victims of violent attacks,” Irapuato’s mayor, Ricardo Ortiz, said in a news conference on Thursday. The vast majority of such facilities in Irapuato, he said, are private and unregulated. Some may even be infiltrated by criminal groups. “In some of these facilities, there may be situations where drug cartels are involved,” the mayor said.']","Violence in many countries has waned during the coronavirus pandemic, but not in Mexico, and warfare between rival criminal gangs has devastated the state of Guanajuato."
Severe Floods in China Leave Over 106 Dead or Missing,2020-07-03,By Raymond Zhong,"['In the inland Chinese city of Yichang, the murky water ran waist-high, stranding people in their cars and turning streets into canals. Near the metropolis of Chongqing, angry torrents of water swept away country roads. The tourist town of Yangshuo experienced a cloudburst that an official called a once-in-two-centuries event. Weeks of abnormally intense rains have wrought destruction across southern China, leaving at least 106 people dead or missing and affecting 15 million residents in the worst flooding that parts of the region have seen in decades. One of the hardest-hit provinces has been Hubei, whose capital, Wuhan, also had the first emergence of the coronavirus last year. Late last month, rescuers smashed car windows to free passengers trapped by floodwater in Yichang, a city in Hubei down the Yangtze River from the Three Gorges Dam, one of the world’s largest. Hubei has had more coronavirus cases than any other part of China. And people there said the last thing they needed was another devastating jolt to their lives, their health and their livelihoods. “Another problem has arisen before the last one subsided,” Deng Jin, 25, a recent college graduate from the city of Enshi, lamented recently on the social platform Weibo. “Hubei in 2020 is both surreal and difficult.” Heavy rains this time of year often swell China’s rivers and cause its reservoirs to overflow. This year, however, the battle against the coronavirus pandemic strained flood preparations, People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, warned in April. The epidemic, combined with the extreme rain, has made dealing with this year’s flooding a “very formidable” task, China’s postal agency wrote in a recent memo urging the authorities to step up their response to the floods, People’s Daily reported this week. After 31 consecutive days of official alerts about torrential rain, the inclement weather shows little sign of letting up. On Friday, the National Meteorological Center forecast another round of downpours in China’s southwest beginning on Saturday. Experts are warning of potential landslides and bursts at reservoirs and dams. In China, most small reservoirs were built in the 1960s and ’70s and did not follow high construction standards, said Brandon Meng, a hydraulic engineer in the southern city of Shenzhen. “Once there is extreme weather,” he said, “it’s very easy for them to be in danger.” As the rains were becoming intense last month, some commentators in China noted how little attention they were receiving, both in Chinese news outlets and on social media. Surely, they said, the confluence of a great plague and great floods should merit wider interest. Perhaps people had grown numb to hardship. Or perhaps China’s government and its censors did not want to draw more attention to people’s suffering. Either way, videos and firsthand accounts of the flooding have since gained wider notice. In Yangshuo, a popular travel destination known for its stunning mountain vistas, an official told the newsmagazine Southern Weekly that the area had experienced a once-in-two-centuries burst of heavy rain on June 7. More than 1,000 hotels and guesthouses and 5,000 shops were damaged, the authorities told Southern Weekly. Qin Hui, a retired history professor, was vacationing in Yangshuo when the rain started coming down in buckets last month. He and his travel partners tried to evacuate but decided that it was too dangerous. They were eating breakfast the next morning when they caught a disturbing sight. “The swimming pool outside the window suddenly went from clear to muddy,” Mr. Qin recounted in an online essay. “It turned out to be floodwater coming in from the tube at the bottom of the pool. Soon after, the murky water flooded out of the pool, quickly covered the yard and then flowed up the stairs.” They were trapped in their hotel for two nights until a volunteer team rescued them. In Chongqing, the city authorities said last month that flooding along the local section of the Qijiang River, upstream from the Yangtze, was the worst since monitoring began in 1940. About 40,000 residents were evacuated, according to official news outlets. Chongqing is in a mountainous part of China, and many structures are built directly into hillsides. A video from one district showed brown water gushing out of an upper window of a residential building, like an artificial waterfall.

"Nicolás Maduro Can’t Sell Venezuelan Gold at Bank of England, Court Rules",2020-07-02,By Elian Peltier and Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['LONDON — A British judge ruled on Thursday that President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela cannot get access to $1.8 billion in gold in a Bank of England vault, because Britain does not recognize him as the leader of his suffering country. Like many Western countries, including the United States, the British government has “unequivocally recognized” the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s interim president, a High Court judge in London, Nigel Teare, wrote in his ruling, adding that it was therefore unlawful to give the gold to Mr. Maduro. The decision was the latest blow to Mr. Maduro and his efforts to revive an economy that has been in free-fall for years, battered by international sanctions, low oil prices, corruption and now the coronavirus. Venezuela’s government has struggled to tackle the pandemic with a once-robust health care system now depleted of its most basic needs. The Central Bank of Venezuela had sought access to the gold reserves in Britain, prompting a legal fight over who had the authority to seek their release — Mr. Guaidó, officially the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly, or Mr. Maduro’s government. Venezuela has long stored gold reserves at the Bank of England, which has the world’s second largest cache of gold behind the New York Federal Reserve. Mr. Maduro’s government said earlier this year that funds raised from selling the equivalent of $1 billion of Venezuela’s gold reserves would be routed through the United Nations Development Program to import food and medicine for an increasingly desperate populace and shore up the country’s pandemic response. Sanctions have helped crush the Venezuelan economy, but food, medical supplies and humanitarian efforts are exempt from British sanctions on the country. Mr. Guaidó’s team, which has urged the British government not to transfer the gold to the Bank of Venezuela since early 2019, argued that the money would be squandered on corruption and cronyism that have been a hallmark of Mr. Maduro’s seven-year rule, turning Venezuela into one of the world’s most dysfunctional countries. The Bank of England refused to release the gold, arguing that it had received conflicting instructions from the rival factions claiming to be Venezuela’s legitimate government, and the Central Bank of Venezuela responded by filing a lawsuit in May. At the heart of the case, Justice Teare wrote, was whom the British government recognized as the president of Venezuela. Mr. Maduro claimed to have won re-election in 2018, and was sworn in for a second term in January, 2019, but Mr. Guaidó and the opposition-controlled National Assembly declared the election and Mr. Maduro’s presidency illegitimate. Under the Venezuelan Constitution, the leader of the National Assembly acts as interim president if the presidency is vacant. The British government, like most countries in Europe and the Americas, recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president. Mr. Guaidó was re-elected president of the National Assembly in January. In his ruling on Thursday, Justice Teare ruled that under a “one-voice doctrine,” Mr. Guaidó was the sole leader of Venezuela, albeit temporarily, and that Mr. Maduro could not transfer the funds. Sarosh Zaiwalla, a lawyer representing the Venezuelan bank, said in a statement that the ruling “entirely ignores the reality of the situation on the ground,” and that it would appeal the decision. “Mr. Maduro’s government is in complete control of Venezuela and its administrative institutions, and only it can ensure the distribution of the humanitarian relief and medical supplies needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” Mr. Zaiwalla said. Mr. Guaidó called the ruling “a great court victory that keeps the gold safe from dictatorship.” He said the gold would remain in the Bank of England until further notice. Mr. Maduro has unsuccessfully tried to withdraw the gold from Britain since 2018, as he grew wary that the bullion could be caught up in international sanctions. Venezuela’s formerly abundant oil exports have slowed to a trickle, and it has become dependent on the hard currency it can raise from gold sales to import basic products and consumer goods. British officials have repeatedly sided with the United States in maintaining painful economic sanctions against Venezuela. President Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, in his recent book about his time at the White House, recounted how in 2019, Britain’s foreign minister at the time, Jeremy Hunt, “was delighted to cooperate on steps they could take, for example freezing Venezuelan deposits in the Bank of England, so the regime could not sell the gold to keep itself going.” The gold reserves are one of the last major financial leftovers from Venezuela’s days as an oil superpower. Under Mr. Maduro the country has suffered a precipitous economic collapse, leaving most of its 30 million citizens struggling to meet basic needs. The already- dismal situation grew worse after oil prices plummeted in March. While the ruling is a significant victory for Mr. Guaidó’s flagging political fortunes, it does nothing to ameliorate Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis, which has been worsened by the pandemic. The authorities have reported over 6,000 coronavirus cases and 54 deaths, but human rights groups contend that the government is likely lowballing the numbers. “The real number is almost certainly much higher, given the limited availability of reliable testing, limited transparency, and the persecution of medical professionals and journalists who report on this issue,” researchers at Human Rights Watch and Johns Hopkins University wrote in May. The ruling puts the United Kingdom and Europe in an increasingly difficult diplomatic posture: supporting a nominal head of state who has no control over Venezuelan territory and whose political bid is becoming increasingly marginalized at home. On Wednesday, Mr. Maduro called new parliamentary elections for December, after staffing electoral posts with loyalists, taking over key opposition parties and jailing or exiling opponents. If Mr. Guaidó and his supporters go ahead with plans to boycott the vote, they will lose control of the National Assembly, which has been the main source of his international legitimacy. Elian Peltier reported from London, and Anatoly Kurmanaev from Caracas, Venezuela.']","It would be unlawful to allow Mr. Maduro access to the gold, a British High Court judge said, because Britain’s government recognizes his rival, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s rightful leader."
Hong Kong Opens Door to China’s Hulking Security State,2020-07-02,By Chris Buckley,"['China’s state security apparatus has largely worked in the shadows while the Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, expanded it over recent years into a bulwark against threats to party rule, public order and national unity. Hong Kong could change that low profile. Under a national security law that went into force this week, China will openly station security officials in Hong Kong to subdue opposition to the party’s rule. The law authorizes these agents to investigate cases, collect intelligence and help oversee enforcement of the rules across schools, news outlets and social organizations. Until now, Chinese agents operated covertly in Hong Kong. “When I was abducted to China, it was done in secret. Now it can be done openly,” said Lam Wing-kee, a Hong Kong book store owner who was snatched in 2015 and spirited to mainland China. He said that security officials placed him in solitary confinement for five months and interrogated him about publishing gossip-laden books about Mr. Xi and other party leaders. “Now that the Chinese national security agencies have official protection in Hong Kong, essentially Hong Kong will be no different from any part of China,” said Mr. Lam, who now lives in Taiwan. The new law for Hong Kong has drawn criticism for introducing ambiguously defined crimes such as separatism and collusion that can be used to stifle protest. On Wednesday, the first full day that the law took effect, the city’s police flexed its new muscle by arresting mostly peaceful demonstrators over behavior deemed to challenge Chinese rule over the territory. But the law also extends China’s security state into Hong Kong, where it will operate beyond the scrutiny of local laws and courts. The open yet untouchable nature of these forces signals a drastic shift for the territory, which has promoted itself as an oasis for the rule of law. For Mr. Xi, Hong Kong represents a logical next step for his expansion of the party’s grip over society. Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has overseen a crackdown that has extinguished political dissent, worker protests, student activism, and ethnic unrest in Tibet and Xinjiang, several experts said. “There’s a lot of parallels between what China has domestically and what they’re imposing on Hong Kong,” said Ryan Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. When Mr. Hass was a director for China at the White House National Security Council from 2013 to 2017, he dealt with members of China’s national security apparatus. “They’re like clouds that hang over society,” Mr. Hass said. “They can decide when the sun is allowed to come through, and they can decide when to block it.” Communist Party leaders see Hong Kong, a former British colony, as a dangerous enclave of Western influence, anti-party sentiment and treasonous separatists on the tip of southern China. After its handover to China in 1997, Hong Kong retained its own legal system and civil liberties. Chinese leaders grew increasingly alarmed and frustrated last year when pro-democracy demonstrations buffeted Hong Kong for months, sometimes bursting into violent standoffs with the police. “Hong Kong is perceived as a vulnerable link in internal security of all China,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, who has studied China’s national security system. “When Hong Kong people protest on the street, it immediately makes Beijing look bad, because these people are raising questions about China’s authoritarian regime.” A Communist Party meeting in October floated a vague proposal to create a national security system for the territory, leaving outsiders to wonder what Mr. Xi had in mind. The law released this week revealed a broadening of China’s security presence in Hong Kong that astonished many for its scope. The law lays out a plethora of new bodies in Hong Kong to enforce the rules against challenging Chinese rule, even peacefully. They include a national security committee in the Hong Kong government, and units in the local police and prosecutors’ office to handle cases under the new law.  China has appointed a national security adviser to Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, who will be Luo Huining, the head of an office that represents Beijing in Hong Kong. He made his reputation as a tough enforcer on the mainland.  Beijing will establish its own security office in the territory, made up of mainland Chinese staff. That office will be led by Zheng Yanxiong, a senior Communist Party official from neighboring Guangdong Province, the government said on Friday. “They will have the effect of intimidating activities by NGOs and other social groups,” said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Just knowing they are there will have its own effect.” Beijing has brusquely dismissed criticism, more or less telling Hong Kong people to get used to much more forceful and intrusive policing to maintain order after the unrest last year. The new law also allows the authorities to prosecute people over political offenses committed abroad, raising the intimidating possibility that migrants from the territory living in, say, Britain or Canada, could be arrested if they returned to Hong Kong after peacefully protesting in their adopted countries. “The central authorities have the power and responsibility to take all the measures necessary to protect national security,” Zhang Xiaoming, a deputy director of the Chinese government office for Hong Kong, told reporters in Beijing this week. Asked about sanctions imposed by Western countries, he said: “What’s this got to do with you? This is entirely our domestic affair.” The Chinese conception of “national security,” however, differs from the standard Western idea that focuses on terrorism, external threats and diplomatic rivalry. In Chinese, the very term for it, guojia anquan, also means “state security,” and official policy is more focused on domestic threats and protecting the Communist Party. China’s Central National Security Commission, which Mr. Xi first convened in 2014 to steer policymaking, is controlled by the Communist Party leadership, rather than the civilian administration, making it — like the People’s Liberation Army — a direct arm of the party. “The Chinese conception of national security goes way beyond what normal foreign policy would cover,” said Ms. Sun of the Stimson Center. “The pivotal starting point is regime security.” Even by China’s tight-lipped standards, its security agencies are strikingly secretive. The Ministry of State Security, which investigates serious national security cases and gathers intelligence at home and abroad, rarely makes public comments and does not have a phone number to answer questions from journalists. The National Security Commission rarely surfaces in public, and clues about its activities must be found scattered on local government websites, which sometimes mention its meetings and directives. The Commission last met a few months ago, when China was struggling to manage its coronavirus crisis. Mr. Xi called a meeting that focused on the threats facing the country in a pandemic-stricken world, according to brief reports on Chinese government websites. “We are confronted with more and more nontraditional security threats,” Chen Wenqing, the Chinese minister of state security, wrote in an article for a Communist Party journal in April, one of his rare public statements. “Faced with the schemes of hostile forces at home and abroad to challenge our core interests, we have to make a clear stand and be unafraid of showing our hand.” In China, national security priorities have become increasingly prominent in propaganda. Mr. Xi has created a National Security Education Day, observed every April, to warn citizens to be on guard against spies and saboteurs, including foreign agents who are said to lure their targets with romantic dinners. Local governments hold inspections to ensure that companies and factories do not leak secrets. Universities and colleges regularly report on ideological tendencies among students and teachers. The Hong Kong law also calls for stricter oversight of schools, news media, internet outlets and associations. Advisers from Beijing may help bring in — probably in a more muted form — some of the monitoring and pressure tactics used in China to stifle potential troublemakers, opponents of the law said. “We used to think of ‘secret police’ as something abstract,” Nathan Law, a prominent leader of the Hong Kong protests, said in a statement issued by the Hong Kong Democracy Council. “Now it is a very real fear.” Mr. Law later indicated in a Facebook post that he had fled Hong Kong out of fear of the security law. He did not disclose his destination.']",A new national security law will allow Beijing’s sprawling and secretive security system to establish a visible foothold in the territory.
"After Fighting Plastic in ‘Paradise Lost,’ Sisters Take On Climate Change",2020-07-03,By Richard C. Paddock and Nyimas Laula,"['SEMINYAK, Indonesia — It was trash season on Bali, the time of year when monsoon storms wash up tons of plastic debris onto the island’s beaches. It was also the time for two teenage sisters, Melati and Isabel Wijsen, to organize their annual island cleanup. Standing on the back of a flatbed truck, megaphones in hand, they kicked off a day of trash collecting at 115 sites around the island. Thousands of people came out to help. “Not only the beaches, we clean up the rivers, we clean up the streets,” Melati Wijsen called out on that February day to an early-morning crowd of hundreds of volunteers, many wearing shirts with the logos of local restaurants and hotels. “This movement is for everyone in Bali.” Melati was 12 and Isabel was 10 when they began a drive to ban plastic bags, at one point threatening a hunger strike to get the Bali governor’s attention. Now, seven years later, they have become local heroes and won international acclaim for their campaign, which resulted in Bali banning plastic bags and other such items that are intended for a single use. The sisters, now 19 and 17, are part of a young generation of global activists, including the 17-year-old Swedish climate-change advocate, Greta Thunberg, calling for urgent action to protect the planet. “Us kids may be only 25 percent of the world’s population, but we are 100 percent of the future,” Isabel likes to say. Since starting their campaign, the sisters have traveled around the world to speak at major events. At 15 and 13, they gave a Ted Talk in London on Bali’s trash crisis. Time magazine listed them among the Most Influential Teens and CNN applauded them as Young Wonders. Melati describes herself as a “change maker” and has been more visible in recent months, while Isabel has focused on finishing high school and taking care of her health after discovering that she has an autoimmune disorder. In January, Melati appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she spoke passionately about the need to pressure companies and governments to ban single-use plastic. Former Vice President Al Gore, who was on the panel with her, drew applause when he said, “Melati, I’m so impressed with you.” Now, the sisters are wrestling with a problem they could not have foreseen: how to be activists during a time of pandemic and social isolation. Shelter-at-home rules have increased the use of plastic both in packaging for delivered items and in protective gear for health care workers, dealing a “major setback” to the anti-plastic movement, Melati said. But she also welcomes the unintended benefits of widespread lockdowns in reducing pollution and allowing wildlife to return to some urban areas. Climate change, Melati said, should prompt officials to take similar, urgent action. “This is a virus that impacts us directly right now, but climate change will do the exact same thing,” she said. “One of the biggest things we have seen from the coronavirus is that government can act quickly. My question is: Why is that not the case when it comes to climate change?” While they may be young in years, the sisters are poised and practiced speakers who have given countless talks and interviews. They are also activists for the social media age, often posting videos and messages about their activities. The daughters of a Dutch mother, Elvira Wijsen, a consultant on sustainable business practices, and an Indonesian father, Eko Riyanto, the director of a furniture export business, they grew up on Bali surrounded by spectacular natural beauty and influenced by the Balinese tradition of living in harmony with nature. The family home is set on the edge of rice fields a short walk from the beach. But despite the idyllic setting, they have encountered plastic trash wherever they go — in the rice fields, at the beach and in the sea — for as long as they can remember. While plastic refuse is a problem everywhere, it is particularly acute in Bali, where it is common for people to toss garbage aside. Some dispose of plastic by burning it with other trash. But even more plastic is washed out to sea by the island’s numerous small rivers, where it drifts in the water, from the surface to the seabed, posing a hazard to aquatic creatures. It is especially bad during the rainy season —\xa0or trash season —\xa0generally from November to March. The sisters attended the private Green School, which says that its mission is teaching children to be leaders and “change makers.” Surrounded by jungle, the school’s elaborate bamboo structures have no walls, and its program promotes independent thinking and innovation. In 2013 the sisters, inspired by a lesson about the lives of Nelson Mandela and Mohandas K. Gandhi, did some research and found that Indonesia was the world’s second-largest source of marine plastic pollution, after China. They also discovered that dozens of jurisdictions around the world had banned single-use plastic. They decided to start their own campaign. They started a group, Bye Bye Plastic Bags, and posted a petition online calling for a ban on single-use plastic. To their amazement, they quickly collected 6,000 signatures — but it would take them six more years to accomplish their goal. During the campaign, they came to see Bali not as an island paradise but “a paradise lost,” Melati said. The sisters found that the island produced enough plastic waste to fill a 14-story building every day but had no island-wide system for collecting garbage. In December 2017, so much debris washed ashore during trash season that the government declared a “garbage emergency” along some of the most popular tourist beaches. Yet the growth of the tourism industry and the construction of hotels have continued apace. Even President Trump has plans for a Trump-branded hotel and golf resort here. “The land is being overpopulated with buildings, new hotels, building on top of the rice fields,” Melati said. “We lose sight of the traditional way of living here on Bali without respecting enough the culture that we have.” To fulfill their goal of banning single-use plastic, the sisters mobilized young people, organized a petition drive and beach cleanups, persuaded shop owners to go plastic-free and lobbied elected officials. They also started Mountain Mamas, a community of women who make reusable shopping bags from recycled material as an alternative to single-use plastic. Over time, they built up a network of more than three dozen Bye Bye Plastic Bags chapters around the world. In 2016, frustrated by resistance from Bali’s then-governor, I Made Mangku Pastika, they borrowed a page from Gandhi and vowed to go on a hunger strike — albeit a modified strike from sunrise to sunset, given their young ages. Within 24 hours, Mr. Pastika agreed to meet with them. With cameras present, he signed an order banning plastic bags, plastic straws and Styrofoam on the island by 2018. But it was one thing issuing an order and quite another enforcing it. That took continued pressure until the ban finally took effect a year ago under a new governor, I Wayan Koster. Melati said she had hoped that 2020 would be a year of action on the environment, building on growing support among young people for measures to reduce plastic waste and slow climate change. But instead, the coronavirus pandemic has meant learning to organize from home, without the social interaction of meetings and rallies. One focus for Melati has been promoting Youthtopia, an international network aimed at helping young people become change makers. She recently posted a video on how to be an activist from home. “There has been this pause that gives us the space to think about how we move forward,” she said. “What do we decide to do? Are we going to go back to normal because the coronavirus didn’t do its job and make us think? Or are we going to say we understand that there is another way?” Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","Melati and Isabel Wijsen began campaigning to reduce plastic waste in Bali seven years ago. Now 19 and 17, they say the pandemic shows that stark measures to protect the planet are possible."
Germany Disbands Special Forces Group Tainted by Far-Right Extremists,2020-07-01,By Katrin Bennhold,"['BERLIN — Germany’s defense minister announced Wednesday that she would partially disband the most elite and highly trained special forces in the country, saying it had been infiltrated by far-right extremism. The defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said one of four fighting companies inside the special forces had become so infested with far-right extremism that it would be dissolved. The rest of the special forces unit, known by its German acronym, KSK, has until the end of October to overhaul its recruitment, training and leadership practices before being allowed to rejoin any international military exercises or missions. “The KSK cannot continue in its current form,” Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer told a news conference, describing “an unhealthy elitism” and “toxic leadership” inside the unit, which, she added, had “developed and promoted extremist tendencies.” The announcement came six weeks after investigators discovered a trove of Nazi memorabilia and an extensive arsenal of stolen ammunition and explosives on the property of a sergeant major who had served in the KSK since 2001. His company is at the center of a long-running controversy over a notorious party three years ago, where soldiers were reported to have flashed Hitler salutes and listened to neo-Nazi rock music. The raid highlighted “a new quality” of far-right extremism among those trained and armed to protect Germany’s democracy, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said. Since then, military leaders and politicians have rolled out a flurry of initiatives, which critics said were long overdue. A committee was formed to report back on far-right extremism in the special forces and to propose measures to combat it. New legislation was passed to make it easier to fire far-right soldiers. And, crucially, the KSK and the rest of the military has been ordered to account for missing weapons and ammunition. Some 48,000 rounds of ammunition and 62 kilograms worth of explosives have gone missing from the special forces, said Gen. Eberhard Zorn, inspector general of the armed forces and co-author of the report on the special forces that was presented on Wednesday. The missing weapons and ammunition have added to concerns that the recent raid was only the tip of the iceberg. The explosives in question were used by the KSK to explode building facades on special missions abroad, General Zorn said. “This is no small thing,” he added. “It worries me very much.” It worries others, too. “Do we have terrorist cells inside our military? I never thought I would ask that question, but we have to,” said Patrick Sensburg, a conservative lawmaker on the intelligence oversight committee and president of the reservist association. The commander of the KSK, Gen. Markus Kreitmayr, wrote a three-page letter to his troops after the recent raid, in which he addressed far-right soldiers directly: “You don’t deserve our camaraderie!” he wrote, urging them to leave the unit on their own. “If you don’t, you will realize that we will find you and get rid of you!” Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said efforts would now be intensified to determine whether recent and older cases of extremism were part of a network. “The probability that it’s not just isolated cases but that there are connections is obvious and has to be fully investigated,” Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said. Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer added that she now wants to better integrate the KSK into the wider military to increase oversight of the unit. Training that had been conducted separately from other units would be opened up, security checks of new recruits would be intensified and the number of years soldiers could serve in the same company would be capped. The report presented to the minister by General Zorn concluded that parts of the KSK existed outside the military chain of command. “The KSK, at least in some areas, has become independent in recent years, under the influence of an unhealthy understanding of elitism by individual leaders.” But the failings were not just inside the KSK, the minister said. Across the military, ammunition and explosives have been allowed to go missing. Christoph Gramm, the president of military counterintelligence, said his agency was currently investigating 600 soldiers, 20 of them in the KSK alone, which has about 1,400 members. “Elite units such as these have cultural factors that may develop into susceptibilities,” Mr. Gramm recently told The New York Times. “For example if there is a misguided sense of tolerance.” “The soldiers have an elitist self-confidence,” he added. “They have special capabilities and skills and a well-developed sense of loyalty. Such a mind-set can involve risks.” Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, the defense minister, said the military counterintelligence service, known as the MAD, had failed in its mission to monitor and detect extremism in recent years. “The work of the MAD was not satisfactory,” she said, adding, “and it’s still not enough.” The KSK turns 25 next year. Many hope that it will have rooted out its far-right extremists by then. “The KSK needs to be our elite for freedom and democracy,” said Eva Högl, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces. But for that to happen, Ms. Högl said, the authorities have to live up to their recent vows to shine a light in all corners of Germany’s institutions. Such vows have been made before. In the early 2000s, members of the National Socialist Underground, a neo-Nazi terrorist group, killed nine immigrants and a police officer over seven years. One of the killers was a former soldier. Paid informants in the domestic intelligence agency helped to hide the group’s leaders and to build its network. When the case finally came to trial, it emerged that key files had been shredded by the agency. Ms. Högl was a member of the parliamentary inquiry into what became known as the N.S.U. scandal. “Two decades later we still don’t know what the authorities knew,” she said. “This time has got to be different.”']","For years, far-right extremists were tolerated inside Germany’s most elite military unit. An underground bunker of explosives has woken the authorities to an alarming problem."
U.K. Grants Asylum to Ex-Consulate Worker Who Told of Torture in China,2020-07-02,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — A former employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong who said he was tortured by the authorities in mainland China last year has been given asylum in Britain. The disappearance last year of the consulate worker, Simon Cheng, during the height of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong highlighted the issues that had set off months of protest. Hong Kongers took to the streets in part over fears that they could be subject to the opaque Chinese legal system as mainland officials expand their reach over people in semiautonomous Hong Kong, a former British colony. “I am grateful for the determination and courage shown by the U.K. government to rescue British nationals,” Mr. Cheng wrote on Facebook above a photo of the letter granting him asylum. “I also hope my case can be a precedent for other Hong Kongers to seek for protection.” The British Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases. The asylum for Mr. Cheng came amid scattered unrest in Hong Kong on Wednesday after China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that seeks to stamp out displays of dissent against the Beijing government. The move has prompted recriminations from other nations against China and spurred fears that it spells the end of the “one country, two systems” framework that had distinguished the territory. The Hong Kong police, which made several arrests under the law during protests on Wednesday, said a 24-year-old man suspected of stabbing a police officer was arrested early Thursday at the city’s airport. Local news outlets said he had been preparing to depart for London. The British government on Wednesday confirmed plans to open a pathway for as many as three million people from Hong Kong to obtain British citizenship. The country’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the decision was in response to the “grave and deeply disturbing” new security law. Mr. Raab called the law a breach of the Joint Declaration, the 1984 treaty under which Britain agreed to return Hong Kong in 1997. He said the law violated the city’s autonomy, threatened civil rights and undermined judicial independence. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the law “outrageous and an affront to all nations,” because under one of its articles, even nonresidents of Hong Kong could conceivably be punished for running afoul of Chinese law. Last year, Mr. Cheng, 29, traveled from Hong Kong to the mainland city of Shenzhen for a business conference. He was stopped by the police on his return to Hong Kong in the city’s high-speed rail station, part of which is under mainland jurisdiction. He was held for 15 days, during which, he said, he was hooded, hung for hours in a spread-eagle position and beaten to force him to stay awake. Under such abuse, Mr. Cheng said, he gave the authorities the password to his iPhone, information about British Consulate operations and the names of some Hong Kong protesters. Mr. Cheng also gave a videotaped admission to soliciting prostitution, which was later released by the Chinese police. After his release, Mr. Cheng denied the allegations against him, insisting his confession had been coerced. The police have often publicized confession videos in high-profile cases, which legal experts say are meant to display the state’s authority over individuals. Mr. Cheng said that his decision to leave Hong Kong had been a result of political persecution, and that he hoped to return some day. “Leaving means not an end but a beginning,” he added. “We will continue the fight against the expanding totalitarianism, and be back to our hometown with true democracy and freedom.” The case strained diplomatic relations between China and Britain, and Beijing’s new national security law threatens to damage those ties further. Mr. Raab said that Britain would grant the roughly 350,000 holders of British overseas passports and an additional 2.5 million who are eligible the right to stay in the country for five years and then transition to applying for citizenship. The British national overseas passport was created for Hong Kong residents but did not give them citizenship rights. The Chinese Embassy in London on Thursday rejected Britain’s new citizenship pathway for overseas passport holders. “If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations,” the embassy said in a statement. “We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, meanwhile, said on Thursday that he was “very actively” considering proposals to provide support to Hong Kong residents. “There are proposals that I asked to be brought forward several weeks ago, and the final touches will be put on those and they’ll soon be considered by cabinet,” he added. Mr. Morrison did not say what kind of residency terms would be offered under the proposals or how many Hong Kongers would be included.']","Simon Cheng was held during the height of the Hong Kong protests last year, and his treatment highlighted concerns about China’s legal system."
Hong Kong’s New Weapon Against Protesters: A Purple Warning Flag,2020-07-01,By Gerry Mullany,"['Just hours after China imposed its tough new national security law on Hong Kong, the city’s police force deployed a new weapon in its running battle with protesters: a purple flag warning demonstrators that shouting certain slogans or carrying banners could now bring criminal charges. The city’s police force has often used different flags in its yearlong battles with protesters — black banners to warn of the imminent firing of tear gas and red flags to signal that a failure to stop advancing would be met with force. But the employment of the newest flag was a surprise for how quickly it was introduced, and reflected the force’s aggressiveness in cracking down on conduct that only a day earlier was not illegal. The flag warned protesters against “displaying flags or banners/chanting slogans/or conducting yourselves with an intent such as secession or subversion, which may constitute offenses” under the new law. “You may be arrested and prosecuted,” it read. The notion of Hong Kong independence has long been a third rail for the Chinese government, but until the introduction of the new law, the authorities were far more restricted in their ability to quell demonstrations. At the height of the pro-democracy protests in the city last year, one of the leading chants was “Hong Kong independence is the only way out.” The new national security law takes direct aim at such sentiments, with sentences of up to life in prison for those found guilty of any violations. The police were not just quick to unfurl their new flag, but to make use of the new law; at midday they announced on Twitter that they had made their first arrest under the new rules, accusing a man, who was not publicly identified, of displaying a Hong Kong independence flag. By the end of Wednesday, the police said they had arrested more than 300 people during the day’s protests, accusing them of crimes ranging from unlawful assembly, disorderly conduct and “furious driving.” Nine of those people were accused of violating the new national security law. Tiffany May contributed reporting.']","The police have long used color-coded banners to warn demonstrators, but the wording on the new flag was a stark reminder of the drastic changes."
"Coronavirus Cases in U.S. Are Rising, Even as Death Rates Trend Down",2020-07-03,,"['This briefing has ended. Click here for the latest updates. After a minor late-spring lull, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States is again on the rise. States like Arizona, Florida and Texas are seeing some of their highest numbers to date, and as the nation hurtles deeper into summer, the surge shows few signs of stopping. Yet the virus appears to be killing fewer of the people it infects — a seemingly counterintuitive trend that might not last, experts said. In April and May, Covid-19 led to as many as 3,000 deaths per day and claimed the lives of roughly 7 to 8 percent of Americans known to have been infected. Now, even though cases are rising in the majority of states, some of which are hitting single-day records, the number of daily deaths is closer to 600, and the death rate is less than 5 percent. Because death reports can lag diagnoses by weeks, the current rise in coronavirus cases could portend increases in mortality in the days to come. However, there are also a few factors that can help explain the apparent drop. One is increased diagnostic testing, which has identified many more infected individuals with mild or no symptoms. That means those who die with Covid-19 form a smaller overall proportion of cases, said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security And with more tests available, infections are often identified earlier, “which allows us to intervene earlier,” said Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease expert in Arizona. Health experts also noted that treatments had improved, and that the virus is now infecting more young people, who are less likely to die of Covid-19. Health officials are urging Americans to scale back their Fourth of July plans as the coronavirus pandemic makes a frightening resurgence. Reports of new cases have increased 90 percent in the United States in the last two weeks. More than 53,000 new daily coronavirus cases were reported in the United States on Friday, according to a New York Times database. That total exceeded all previous daily counts but the 55,595 on Thursday, the first time the number had passed 50,000. At least five states set single-day case records on Friday: Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, North Carolina and South Carolina, according to data compiled by The New York Times. In South Carolina, where more than 1,800 new cases were announced Friday, the positivity rate has hovered around 20 percent this week, up from about 10 percent in early June. In Kansas, where at least 770 new cases were announced, daily reporting totals vary widely because the state government only releases new data three times a week. The state reported positivity rates exceeding 10 percent for the first three days in July, a significant uptick from mid-June when the rate hovered between 5 and 7 percent. On Thursday, the United States set a single-day case record for the sixth time in nine days, with more than 55,000 new cases announced, and single-day highs in eight states. Domestic travel restrictions have re-emerged, and many locales have slowed or reversed reopenings. The vast majority of July 4 fireworks displays in big cities and small rural towns have been canceled. Most politicians, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, are forgoing the traditional parades and flag-waving appearances. President Trump, however, has a different, discordant message: The sparkly, booming show must go on at all costs. Mr. Trump was in South Dakota on Friday evening for a massive fireworks display at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, a made-for-TV patriotic display that he has spent years lobbying to revive. (There have been no fireworks at Mount Rushmore since 2009 because of fears that they would set off forest fires and contaminate groundwater.) Few in the packed crowd of supporters wore masks. In his pre-fireworks speech, Mr. Trump barely mentioned the pandemic, which has killed more than 120,000 people in America, instead choosing to cast himself as waging battle against a “new far-left fascism.” Hours before Mr. Trump spoke at Mount Rushmore, law enforcement officials, many holding shields, clashed with protesters blocking a road. As tension escalated, an officer warned demonstrators that they should disperse if they wanted to avoid chemical agents. “It’s not going to be a pleasant smell,” the officer said, according to a video posted on Twitter. “If you don’t mind it, you can stay here, but it’s going to be very irritating.” Anti-Trump protesters chanted and held signs reading, “You are trespassing on stolen land,” and “Black Lives Matter,” according to video footage of the event. A group of Trump supporters held Trump 2020 posters and “All Lives Matter” signs. Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Mr. Trump’s eldest son and a top fund-raising official for the Trump re-election campaign, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday before the event at Mount Rushmore, a person familiar with her condition said. Ms. Guilfoyle traveled to South Dakota with Donald Trump Jr. They did not travel aboard Air Force One, according to the person familiar with her condition, and she was the only person in the group who tested positive. The president plans to follow up his trip with a “Salute to America” celebration the following day on the South Lawn at the White House, including a military flyover and a massive fireworks display on the National Mall that Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, has warned violates local health guidelines. Mr. Trump has consistently downplayed concerns over new cases, claiming that young people “get better much easier and faster” and that the virus will “just disappear.” In many places across the country, face coverings have gone from suggestions to mandates, but Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican, said there were no plans to enforce social distancing during Mr. Trump’s open-air address before a live audience, framed by some of the nation’s most revered presidents. Early in the pandemic, more than 1,000 cases were linked to the Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, which remains one of the country’s largest known clusters. But in recent weeks, South Dakota has had one of the country’s most encouraging trend lines. The state has averaged a few-dozen new cases each day, including 85 announced Friday. There has not been a day with more than 100 new cases in South Dakota since late May. A number of protests are planned for Independence Day in the nation’s capital, ahead of the annual fireworks display and a military flyover hosted by Mr. Trump. Since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the end of May, Washington has become a center of protests. Its mayor, Muriel Bowser, publicly challenged Mr. Trump’s decision to order National Guard troops into the city during demonstrations against racism and police brutality, and she presided over the painting of the words “Black Lives Matter” in giant yellow letters on a street near the White House. Black Lives Matter DC and two other groups, Sunrise and the Black Youth Project 100, announced several events over the weekend focused on defunding the police. The Instagram account #dcteensaction lists at least nine protests for Saturday, including a march near the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and an evening protest beginning in Malcolm X Park. For the official celebration, the federal government said it would provide around 300,000 face coverings, and a news release from the Department of the Interior warned visitors to observe social distancing — while noting that viewing areas on the Mall would be accessible by four security entry points. Ms. Bowser told reporters that she did not think the event was in keeping with federal health officials’ guidelines for gatherings during the pandemic. The holiday comes amid a national reckoning over racism, and the founding story of the United States is part of what is being questioned right now. William H. Lamar IV, the pastor of the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, a few blocks from the White House, said that he did not normally celebrate the Fourth but that this year  the country might be observing the holiday with more honesty than usual. “The symbols coming down, that’s only the beginning,” Reverend Lamar said. “That’s people saying, ‘We need a new story. This story excludes me. It is inherently violent and evil. It murdered me. It erased me as a human being. I deserve a story that includes me and wants me to flourish.’” He added: “Is there a kind of national story that can hold us together in this multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious reality? The survival of this experiment called America depends upon it.” Brazil, which has more coronavirus cases than any country but the United States, topped 1.5 million total infections on Friday, just two weeks after reaching a million cases, according to a New York Times database. But even as the country passed that grim milestone, President Jair Bolsonaro vetoed a measure that would have provided masks to vulnerable groups and required businesses to provide masks to their employees, according to The Associated Press. Since mid-June, some major cities in Brazil have eased preventive measures. Shopping malls have already reopened in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Beaches are starting to draw crowds again. And Rio allowed gyms and bars to reopen at 50 percent capacity on Thursday, while some hospital systems were close to running out of intensive care beds. If the country’s trend lines hold, some epidemiologists project the pandemic’s death toll in Brazil could surpass that of the U.S. by late July. Brazil had recorded 63,174 total deaths as of Friday; the U.S. has recorded 129,402. Some experts initially thought that Brazil was well equipped to cope with the pandemic, based on its track record during past public health emergencies. Brazil has a public health care system that, while underfunded, provides robust coverage across the country. Global roundup Starting July 10, England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of America. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in easing restrictions. The European Union recently upheld a ban on U.S. travelers, even as it opened its borders to visitors from Canada, Rwanda, Thailand and 15 other countries. England’s policy, announced on Friday, is less restrictive: Americans can still enter so long as they agree to isolate themselves for two weeks. The United States has barred most visitors from Britain since March, after briefly exempting them from a travel ban on the European Union. At the time, Europe was dealing with far more coronavirus infections than the United States. Since then, the epicenter of the pandemic has moved across the Atlantic. However, Britain still has the world’s third-highest known death toll, with triple-digit death counts still coming most days. More than half the country’s nursing homes have had at least one case since March. The government announced on Friday that nursing home residents will be tested for the virus monthly, while staff members will receive tests weekly, officials announced. Some public-health experts said the fractious debate over the travel quarantine had distracted from more pressing problems, like safely reopening Britain’s schools and organizing an effective test-and-trace program. “The U.K. government seems focused on giving people a summer pandemic holiday instead of dealing with the hard issues facing the aviation industry for the coming year,” said Professor Devi Sridhar, the director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said earlier this week that it was Britons’ “patriotic duty” to go to the pub when they reopen at 6 a.m. on Saturday, has now urged people not to “overdo it.” His warning came after tens of thousands have flocked to beaches, organized illegal music parties and violated social-distancing rules in recent weeks. “Let’s not blow it now, folks,” Mr. Johnson told LBC radio on Friday, weeks after he announced that the country’s “long hibernation” was over and that the virus was under control. In other news: Brazil, which has been experiencing a surge in virus cases, allowed restaurants and bars to reopen with conditions on Thursday, according to The Associated Press. Gyms, dance, fighting and swimming classes were also authorized to restart, The A.P. said, as long as there is no physical contact, a third of capacity and a time-slot schedule. Seeking to give his government a fresh start after the pandemic battered the nation, President Emmanuel Macron of France shuffled prime ministers on Friday, trading in the popular incumbent, Édouard Philippe, for a relatively unknown functionary who helped guide the country out of the health emergency, Jean Castex. Mr. Philippe is one of three government officials facing investigation into their handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to French prosecutors. Air France, which like other airlines has seen ticket sales plummet, told labor union leaders on Friday that it needs to cut about 7,500 jobs by the end of 2022, but that it would achieve the most through attrition and would also offer buyouts, early retirement packages and assistance with applying for open positions at the company. The airline has received 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) from the French government. Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose successful response to the coronavirus crisis in Germany has been widely praised, was seen wearing a mask for the first time on Friday, as she headed into a session at the cramped Bundesrat. Asked by a reporter this week why she didn’t mask, even as she encourages Germans to, she said: “If I keep the social distancing rules, then I don’t need to wear a mask. And when I don’t social distance, when I go shopping for example, we clearly never run into each other.” Spain said on Friday that it would not reopen its borders with Morocco after Morocco’s decision to keep entry points closed that are used by millions of people every summer. The dispute also affects Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in North Africa. Spain also said that it would bar arrivals from Algeria and China. The European Union reopened its borders this week to travelers from 15 countries, including Algeria, while travelers from China would be permitted if China reciprocates. Austria recorded more than 100 new cases of the virus on a single day this week, its highest such total in more than two months. Many of the confirmed infections are connected to a religious community in Linz, a city in the northern part of the country, and officials closed schools and day care centers in the area for a week. Austria’s health ministry has registered 17,959 cases and 705 deaths. Spending two weeks quarantined in a hotel room is not a pleasant experience, as thousands of people who’ve flown internationally since the pandemic began can attest. But the 300 foreigners confined to a Ramada hotel in Yongin, South Korea, have it worse than most. Each day for the past week, from about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., protesters outside the hotel have been raising a deafening noise with drums, brass gongs and loudspeakers blaring music. They are local residents, angry that the government chose a hotel in their neighborhood as a quarantine site. “Even with double-glazed windows, they can still be heard when the windows are closed,” said James Martin Thompson, an app developer from Washington, from his fifth-floor room in the hotel, the Ramada by Wyndham Yongin. “When you’re stuck in a small indoor space 24/7, being able to open the windows makes it much more bearable,” said Mr. Thompson. “And during much of the daytime, that isn’t practical with the noise coming from the demonstrators.” On June 11, the South Korean government designated the Ramada as one of eight facilities where foreigners who arrive with no Covid-19 symptoms are quarantined for two weeks. Three days later, a foreigner quarantined at the hotel tested positive for the coronavirus. Since then, residents of the neighborhood, called Jeondae-ri, have been accusing the government of recklessly exposing them to infection. On June 27, protesters began their daily noise-making campaign in front of the 18-story hotel, hoping to force the authorities to send foreigners elsewhere for quarantine. A large banner that protesters hung in front of the Ramada read, “This is a hotel that produced a confirmed Covid-19 case. Shut it down immediately!” The foreigners are confined to their rooms with little hope of escaping the torment, even if they wanted to try. Vice President Mike Pence changed his travel plans in Arizona after Secret Service agents set to accompany with him tested positive or showed symptoms, two administration officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according to a person familiar with Mr. Pence’s travel. A swift rise in new cases in the state has overwhelmed testing centers in recent days, and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, ordered bars, gyms and movie theaters closed this week. As of Friday, there have been more than 4,300 new cases reported in the state. In an apparent acknowledgment of outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the vice president canceled his plan to headline a “Faith in America” campaign rally in Tucson on Tuesday and then tour Yuma with Mr. Ducey. Instead, Mr. Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor International Airport. “Help is on the way,” Mr. Pence said at a news conference with Mr. Ducey at the airport, after descending the steps of Air Force Two wearing a mask, the latest sign of the administration’s evolving stance on face coverings. But the positive tests and symptoms of Secret Service agents expected to be in proximity to the man who is next in line for the presidency were some of the factors that prompted his change of schedule, the officials said. The news of the agents who showed symptoms, or tested positive, was first reported by The Washington Post. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not respond to a request for comment. The latest illnesses among the small circle of individuals who interact directly with the vice president were a reminder of the dangers of carrying on with campaign and official government travel as the pandemic rages on. President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras has been discharged from the hospital after receiving more than two weeks of inpatient treatment for Covid-19 and related pneumonia. He was admitted on June 17, hours after he tested positive for the illness. His wife, Ana García, also tested positive, but convalesced at home. “My commitment to Honduras is stronger than ever,” Mr. Hernández said on Twitter, announcing his release on Thursday. “To work!” Officials said he would continue his recuperation in isolation at home. Honduras, like many other countries in Latin America, is struggling to contain the spread of the virus. As of Friday, more than 21,000 cases had been confirmed in Honduras, along with more than 590 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared Latin America the center of the pandemic, and several countries in the region are now suffering some of the world’s worst outbreaks. The organization’s regional director for the Americas, Carissa Etienne, warned this week that the death toll from Covid-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean could roughly quadruple by October to more than 438,000. U.S. Roundup As case counts continued to hit record highs in many states, local officials released new guidance, creating a patchwork system for Americans planning to celebrate the holiday weekend. As many as 80 percent of community fireworks displays in large cities and small rural towns have been canceled this year over fears that they would create a social distancing nightmare. In New York City, instead of the usual hourlong fireworks extravaganza, Macy’s will have five-minute displays in undisclosed locations across the five boroughs. The grand finale on Saturday, which will also be from an undisclosed location, will be televised. In Florida, Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. And on Friday, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez’s countywide curfew, which was announced Thursday, went into effect from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Mr. Giménez also rolled back the opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their reopening plans approved by the county. Florida reported more than 9,400 new cases Friday. Exactly one month earlier, the state reported just 1,317 new cases. In Mississippi, which reported more than 900 new coronavirus cases Friday — the second-highest single day total recorded by the state — Gov. Tate Reeves’s executive orders will allow indoor gatherings of up to 20 people. Bars and restaurants can offer indoor dining as long as they stay below 50 percent capacity. Backyard BBQs can have up to 100 people so long as guests remain socially distanced. And outdoor stadiums will also be allowed to remain open at 25 percent capacity, potentially allowing thousands to gather at a single event. And in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott reversed course on Thursday, ordering residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. Texas has been one of the worst-hit states in the past week reaching a record number of hospitalizations on Friday, up 270 to 7,652, and reporting more than 6,400 new cases. Elsewhere in the U.S.: In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an executive order allowing local officials to pass mask ordinances on Friday. Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, never implemented a statewide stay-at-home order, instead opting to close high-contact businesses like gyms and personal care services. More than 540 new cases were announced in the state on Friday, just a day after a record 878 cases were reported, according to a New York Times database. Critics of Amtrak’s newly announced cutbacks worry that the rail agency will not bring back service to the long-distance routes it has long sought to end. With ridership down 95 percent and revenue plummeting, Amtrak plans to cut up to 20 percent of its work force by October and suspend daily service on routes that service over 220 communities. Amtrak has received letters from 16 senators asking why it needed to enact such steep cuts since it had already received $1 billion in emergency aid. Results of Major League Baseball’s first round of widespread coronavirus testing were released on Friday, as preseason training resumed in full after being shut down for more than three months. Out of 3,185 tests, 38 were positive (31 players and seven staff members). The league plans to open a 60-game season on July 23, with no fans in the stands. Preseason preparation has resumed at teams’ home stadiums rather than returning to spring-training sites in Florida and Arizona. In New York Times/Siena College surveys of voters in battleground states for the presidential election, supporters of Joseph R. Biden Jr. were far more likely than President Trump’s to be concerned about in-person voting during the pandemic. About 40 percent of Mr. Biden’s supporters said they would feel uncomfortable, compared with just 6 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters. Most of these people said they would go to the polls anyway, but 8 percent of Mr. Biden’s surveyed supporters and less than 2 percent of Mr. Trump’s said they would be too uncomfortable to go vote. Voting by mail for any reason is available in all six battleground states included in the Times/Siena data. Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said Thursday that travelers from 15 states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two weeks or face up to $7,000 in fines. Some 13,400 employees, or nearly 70 percent of the staffing, of Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles U.S. visas and naturalization, face furlough by Aug. 3 because the immigration processing fees that fund it have plummeted The SAG-AFTRA actors’ union issued a do-not-work notice to its members for a pandemic-themed independent film starring Demi Moore and Craig Robinson, saying that producers had “not been transparent about their safety protocols.” Producers for the film, “Songbird,” include Michael Bay, who is better known for his work on big-budget films, and Adam Goodman, a former president of production at Paramount Pictures. “Songbird” has drawn attention as one of the first movies aiming to roll cameras since the virus brought production in Hollywood to a halt in March. California allowed film and television shoots to resume on June 12 — under strict safety protocols — and Los Angeles began issuing permits last week. So far, however, only a handful of TV shows (mostly soap operas like “The Bold and the Beautiful”) have restarted production; none of the major movie studios are expected to shoot anything before next month. The independent companies behind “Songbird” have said they planned to use nontraditional camera techniques to avoid having actors in proximity. The film, a thriller, takes place in the near future during a pandemic lockdown — martial law has been imposed to combat a fast-mutating virus — and focuses on a young woman and a motorbike courier with rare immunity. Representatives for the producers either declined to comment or did not respond to a query. Invisible Narratives, one of the companies involved, told Deadline, an entertainment trade news site, that it was “actively working to resolve this paperwork issue.” Leaders in many states are urging people to stay at home this holiday weekend. Here are some safe ideas for enjoying the Fourth of July holiday. College students across the country have been warned that campus life will look dramatically different in the fall, with temperature checks at academic buildings, masks in half-empty lecture halls and maybe no football games. What they might not expect: a lack of professors in the classroom. Thousands of instructors at American colleges and universities have told administrators in recent days that they are unwilling to resume in-person classes because of the pandemic. More than three-quarters of colleges and universities have decided students can return to campus this fall. But they face a growing faculty revolt. “Until there’s a vaccine, I’m not setting foot on campus,” said Dana Ward, 70, an emeritus professor of political studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who teaches a class in anarchist history and thought. “Going into the classroom is like playing Russian roulette.” This comes as major outbreaks have hit college towns this summer, spread by partying students and practicing athletes. In Pennsylvania, a Penn State student living off campus has died of respiratory failure and Covid-19, the first known death of a student at the university related to the virus, according to the university. The student, Juan Garcia, 21, who was in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, had been living off-campus in State College when he began to feel sick, the university said in an announcement expressing its condolences. He went home to Allentown on June 19, and tested positive for the coronavirus the next day. He died on June 30, the university said. The death comes as faculty, concerned about their own safety and that of students, are organizing to have more say in the campus opening for the fall. Sarah J. Townsend, an associate professor of Spanish and Portuguese and a faculty organizer, said the student’s death was disturbing in part because of the close connection between the campus and the surrounding town. In an indication of how fluid the situation is, the University of Southern California said on Wednesday that an “alarming spike” in coronavirus cases had prompted it to reverse an earlier decision to encourage attending classes in person. With more than a month before campuses start reopening, it is hard to predict how many professors will refuse to teach face-to-face classes in the fall. But colleges and professors are planning ahead. U.S. Roundup New York, transformed by the virus and protests for racial justice, has been cooped up, and a good, old-fashioned swim “takes the edge off,” said Rachel Thompson, a schoolteacher. She was at Rockaway Beach in Queens on Wednesday as New York City opened its beaches for swimming — just in time for the Fourth of July weekend, when even more people are expected to pack the sand. Still, several beachgoers that morning, Ms. Thompson included, were feeling a bit jittery about the city’s gradual reopening. An hour after the ban on swimming was lifted, the mayor announced that indoor dining at restaurants would not resume on Monday as anticipated, citing the virus’s rapid spread in other large states. Mayor Bill de Blasio, worried that large crowds might risk virus transmission, had kept the city’s 14 miles of beaches closed even as temperatures rose — along with frustration from long-quarantined New Yorkers. With an estimated million visitors total on a hot day, they are some of the country’s most crowded shorelines, and people largely access them via subways and buses. Safety measures include lifeguards in masks carrying waist packs with a face mask, gloves and hand sanitizer. Beachgoers must keep at least six feet apart and wear face coverings when on the sand or the boardwalk. Restrooms will operate at half-capacity, and boardwalk concessions must offer to-go service only. Hundreds of city workers, deployed as social distancing ambassadors, will hand out masks, keep space between beachgoers, tally beachgoers to prevent overcrowding, tend beach entrances to limit capacity and, if necessary, direct people to less crowded sections. Worries have lingered about a possible backslide in the state, where, after reining in the virus, there have been a few alarming outbreaks, such those at a house party and graduation party in the suburbs just north of the city. Elsewhere in the U.S.: In Miami-Dade County, Fla., the mayor imposed a countywide curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., starting Friday; he also rolled back the opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their reopening plans approved by the county. Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. On Friday, Florida reported 9,488 new cases. Critics of Amtrak’s newly announced cutbacks worry that the rail agency will not bring back service to the long-distance routes it has long sought to end.

Voting by mail for any reason is available in all six battleground states included in the Times/Siena data. Texas, one of the worst-hit states in the past week, saw a record number of hospitalizations on Friday, up 270 to 7,652. In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said Thursday that travelers from 15 states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two weeks or face up to $7,000 in fines.

More than 540 new cases were announced in the state on Friday, just a day after a record 878 cases were reported, according to a New York Times database. Identifying likely voters is a challenge for pollsters in every election. This year, the coronavirus, mail voting and a surge in political engagement may make it even harder than usual. For now, Mr. Biden’s nine-point lead across the critical battleground states is so significant that it is essentially invulnerable to assumptions about turnout, according to New York Times/Siena College surveys of the states likeliest to decide the election. But supporters of Mr. Biden are far more likely to be concerned about in-person voting during the pandemic, and his wide polling lead among registered voters could narrow if their concerns persist to the election. Over all, one-quarter of registered voters in the battleground states said they would feel uncomfortable voting in person. People were asked if they would feel uncomfortable voting in person if the election were held during the week they were interviewed in June. About 40 percent of Mr. Biden’s supporters said they would feel uncomfortable, compared with just 6 percent of President Trump’s supporters. This political divide transcends demographics. A young Biden supporter in a rural area, for instance, would be likelier to feel uncomfortable voting than an older Trump supporter in a city, even though the health risk is probably quite low for the Biden voter and potentially quite significant for the Trump supporter. Most of these voters would go to the polls anyway. But about one-quarter of the uncomfortable voters — or about 6 percent of the overall electorate — said they would feel too uncomfortable to vote in person if the election were held during the week they were interviewed. This includes 8 percent of all of Mr. Biden’s supporters in the battleground states, compared with fewer than 2 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters. It is important to emphasize that no-excuse absentee voting, in which any voter can request a mail ballot, is available in all six of the battleground states included in the Times/Siena data. On Thursday, the Supreme Court blocked a trial judge’s order that would have made it easier for voters in three Alabama counties to use absentee ballots in this month’s primary runoff election. The court’s brief, unsigned order gave no reasons, which is typical when it rules on emergency applications, and it said the order would remain in effect while appeals moved forward. The court’s four more liberal members — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — said they would have rejected Alabama’s request. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, who said earlier this week that it was Britons’ “patriotic duty” to go to the pub when they reopen on Saturday, has now urged people not to “overdo it.” His warning came after tens of thousands have flocked to beaches, organized illegal music parties and violated social-distancing rules in recent weeks. Britain has reported the world’s third-highest pandemic death toll, with triple-digit death counts still coming most days. “Let’s not blow it now, folks,” Mr. Johnson told LBC radio on Friday, weeks after he announced that the country’s “long hibernation” was over and that the virus was under control. Restaurant industry workers have said in British news outlets that they were afraid of going back to work, and concerns are high that pub customers could flout basic rules and trigger new waves of infections. A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said that pubs could reopen starting at 6 a.m. on Saturday, “in the event anybody would attempt to try to open at midnight.” On Wednesday, the Treasury tweeted that people should “grab a drink and raise a glass” when pubs reopen. The tweet was later deleted. A pub in south London has promised “endless supply” of drinks to “fuel your shenanigans,” after more than three months of closure, which was a first in the history of the country’s pubs. Pubs — like restaurants, hair salons and other businesses welcoming visitors again on Saturday — will have to maintain a 21-day record of their customers, the government has said, to trace contacts in case of new outbreaks. In Leicester, 100 miles north of London, pubs and other nonessential businesses will remain closed because of a regional outbreak of virus cases. The British authorities also announced on Friday that, starting July 10, travelers from countries in Europe including France, Italy and Spain will no longer have to self-quarantine for 14 days. The change will currently only apply to England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland expected to set up their own rules. Starting July 10, England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of America. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in easing restrictions. Residents in nursing homes in Britain will be tested for the virus monthly, while staff members will receive tests weekly, officials announced. According to a survey published on Friday by the Office for National Statistics, 56 percent of the country’s nursing homes have had at least one case since March, with 20 percent of residents in such facilities known to have been infected. Out of the nearly 44,000 reported deaths in Britain, at least 15,500 people have died in nursing homes. China appears to be downplaying expectations ahead of a planned trip next week by a World Health Organization team to the country to investigate the origins of the outbreak. Since the head of the W.H.O., Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced the trip on Monday, several Chinese officials and experts have said that any investigation into the origins of the virus should not focus only on China. “It does not matter which country the scientific identification work starts with, as long as it involves all related countries and is fairly conducted,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run nationalist newspaper Global Times on Tuesday. Wang Guangfa, a top government health adviser, told Global Times this week that the W.H.O. should also go to Spain. He cited a not-yet-published study by researchers at the University of Barcelona that suggests the virus was present in Spain’s wastewater as early as March 2019. Independent experts have said the study was flawed, and that other lines of evidence strongly suggest the virus emerged in China late last year. The virus most likely originated in bats, but the path of transmission is still unknown. Experts say establishing that will be a crucial step in preventing future outbreaks. The hunt for information has focused on Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus is believed to have first emerged, and specifically the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was said to have sold wildlife and had links to many of the country’s first reported cases. Mike Ryan, head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program, said on Wednesday that the agency would be sending two experts from Geneva to join its China team on next week’s trip. He said one would likely be an epidemiologist and the other an expert in animal health. Dr. Ryan did not reveal which cities the team was planning to visit. He described it as a “scoping mission.” Getting answers on the origins of the virus has become more difficult as the issue has become increasingly politicized. China has been on the defensive for months in response to growing criticism from the United States and other countries for its initial mishandling of the outbreak. Officials from both the United States and China have, without providing evidence, accused each other of intentionally releasing the virus. But at a news briefing this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman sounded a less-aggressive note. “China has always believed that virus tracing is a scientific issue, and relevant research should be carried out by scientists and medical experts,” said Zhao Lijian, the spokesman, who in March promoted a theory that the U.S. Army purposely introduced the virus to China. “China continues to support scientists from all over the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and spread of viruses,” he added. In Columbia, Mo., where coronavirus case numbers are as high as they’ve ever been, contact tracers are overwhelmed. Around Seattle, where a surge is underway, officials warned that social distancing was waning. And in Flint, Mich., where there are worrisome signs after weeks of improvement, the mayor said the city would crack down on late-night parties that have drawn hundreds of young people. “Someday we will welcome these crowds to our great city,” Flint’s mayor, Sheldon Neeley, said. “Now is not the time.” As the pandemic spirals further out of control in the United States, politicians and public health officials have become noticeably more stern. New cases reported have increased 90 percent in the United States in the last two weeks. On Thursday, the U.S. also set a single-day case record for the sixth time in nine days, with more than 55,000 new cases announced, and single-day highs in eight states. In many places, face coverings have gone from suggestions to mandates. Bars have been reopened — and closed again. Domestic travel restrictions have re-emerged. And mayors have told people to shape up and follow the rules. “I know that wearing a mask is uncomfortable,” said Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, where case numbers are spiking and face coverings are now required. “I know that, unfortunately, wearing a mask has become a political flash point. But I also know that masks save lives.” In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, one of the worst-hit states in the past week, on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Thursday that travelers from 15 states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two weeks or face up to $7,000 in fines. In Los Angeles County, Calif., where there are more than 2,000 new cases most days, the top public health official said “we urgently need to make a change in the trajectory.” And in Northern California, where the outlook is also bad, leaders in several counties urged residents to celebrate the Fourth of July at home and not test the limits of the law. “Just because you can does not mean it is safe or that you should rush to do it,” said Dr. Matt Willis, the Marin County public health officer. President Trump plans to celebrate the Independence Day holiday with a fireworks display on Friday at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota. About 7,500 people are expected to attend the outdoor event, where masks will be available but not required. As the United States headed into the Fourth of July weekend, officials were telling people to hold the partying until next year. The coronavirus has exploded in large parts of the nation: On Thursday, the U.S. set a single-day case record for the sixth time in nine days, with more than 50,000 new cases reported for the first time, according to a New York Times database. The figure topped 55,000 by the end of the day. Thursday’s daily new case total represented an increase of more than 85 percent since two weeks ago, when states were reopening after extensive lockdowns tempered the outbreak, particularly in the hard-hit Northeast. Until last week, the country had not surpassed a record daily total for two months, since 36,738 new cases were reported on April 24. In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, one of the worst-hit states in the past week, on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. But as the number of cases increased in recent weeks, he cleared the way for local authorities to require masks in businesses, before imposing the more aggressive statewide requirement. Vice President Mike Pence changed a planned trip this week to Arizona after Secret Service agents set to travel with him tested positive for the coronavirus or showed symptoms, two administration officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according to a person familiar with Mr. Pence’s travel. A swift rise in new cases in the state had overwhelmed testing centers in recent days, and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, ordered bars, gyms and movie theaters closed this week. In an apparent acknowledgment of outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the vice president canceled his plan to headline a “Faith in America” campaign rally in Tucson on Tuesday and then to tour Yuma with Mr. Ducey. Instead, Mr. Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor International Airport. At least eight states reported single-day case records on Thursday: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Tennessee. Only a dozen states, mostly in the Northeast, have managed to keep new case levels flat or declining. In Florida, Mayor Carlos A. Giménez of Miami-Dade County imposed a countywide curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., starting Friday. Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. “This is one of various actions I’m pursuing to tamp down this spike of Covid-19 and protect our residents,” Mr. Giménez said. He is also rolling back the opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their reopening plans approved by the county.

Boris Johnson’s ‘Global Britain’: Inspired Vision or Wishful Thinking?,2020-07-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his pro-Brexit allies have long promised that once Britain broke free of the European Union, it could play a bold new role on the world stage — one they dubbed Global Britain. For a few days this week, it looked as if they were actually making good on that promise. When China imposed a new security law on Hong Kong, Mr. Johnson not only condemned the Chinese government, he also threw open Britain’s doors to nearly three million residents of the former British colony who were eligible for residency in Britain. It was a strong, some even said brave, stand by a long-departed colonial government against the oppression of a rising superpower. But it was, in the end, also a signpost of Britain’s diminished stature: The Chinese threatened retaliation, while Mr. Johnson’s ministers admitted that there was nothing they could do if China refused to allow those people to leave Hong Kong. “We’re a medium-size power that needs to work with others to secure what we want around the world,” said Chris Patten, who served as the last British governor of Hong Kong. Leaving the European Union, he said, had deprived Britain of its most natural partner “in trying to deal with these global issues.” The clash with China laid bare deeper contradictions in Mr. Johnson’s post-Brexit vision: Britain wants to go global at a time when globalization is in retreat. It has cast off from the world’s largest trading bloc when the world is more divided than ever into competing regions. And it is trying to carve out an overseas role just as the coronavirus pandemic has crippled its domestic economy. Mr. Johnson’s model is no longer Winston Churchill, the proud symbol of Britain’s imperial reach, but Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal put American society back on its feet after the Great Depression. With millions of Britons facing joblessness and a mammoth rebuilding project at home, Mr. Johnson’s government scarcely has the bandwidth to reestablish Britain as an energetic player on the global stage. His ministers no longer invoke the phrase Singapore-on-Thames, which once described the kind of agile, lightly regulated, free-trading powerhouse that they envisioned emerging from Brexit. Moreover, the geopolitical landscape has shifted significantly since the Brexit referendum — and even more rapidly since the pandemic spread around the world. With rivalry and antagonism between China and the West on the rise, Britain as a free agent will be caught uncomfortably in between, constantly forced to choose sides in a postpandemic world. “One consequence of a postglobalization world is that people will start to think in a defensive way about blocs,” said Mark Malloch Brown, a former deputy secretary general of the United Nations. “Britain is adrift without a bloc. That is going to be challenging, and a first example of this is Hong Kong.” British diplomats showed skill in lining up the United States, Canada and Australia to sign a stern letter to the Chinese government about the new law. But in defending the rights of those who hold British overseas passports, Britain is on its own. Neither the European Union, so recently forsaken by Britain, nor the United States, largely indifferent to human rights under President Trump, is eager to join that fight. Mr. Johnson once cast Britain’s independence as a competitive advantage. He said it would allow the country to pursue trade agreements with China, the United States or anyone else, unencumbered by the European Union. “As Global Britain, our range is not confined to the immediate European hinterland as we see the rise of new powers,” said Mr. Johnson, then serving as foreign secretary, in a speech to Chatham House in December 2016. “It is right that we should make a distinctive approach to policymaking, as regards China.” But as relations between China and the United States have soured, Mr. Johnson is caught in the middle. After initially fending off pressure from Mr. Trump to keep the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei out of Britain’s 5G digital network, Mr. Johnson has been forced to reconsider. Some analysts say they expect him to reverse himself and impose additional restrictions on Huawei. Part of the reason is technical: American sanctions on Huawei have raised the security risks of allowing the company to build a large part of the network. But part of it is geopolitical reality. In any coming Cold War between the United States and China, Britain cannot afford to alienate its most important ally. “The danger is finding ourselves trapped between President Trump and President Xi,” Mr. Patten said, referring to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump’s faltering political fortunes pose another risk to Mr. Johnson. The president has enthusiastically supported Brexit and embraced the prime minister as a like-minded populist. If Mr. Trump were to lose in November, Mr. Johnson would face an uncertain new counterpart in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There is nothing to suggest that Mr. Biden would not champion the alliance with Britain. On some issues, like Iran and climate change, there would be fewer points of friction. But Mr. Biden is not likely to attach the same priority to a trade deal that Mr. Trump has. Former President Barack Obama famously warned Britons they would be at the “back of the queue” for trade talks if they voted for Brexit. Mr. Biden is also a devoted Irish-American who would look out for Ireland’s interests, as Britain negotiates its long-term trade relationship with the European Union (a breakthrough in those talks seems more elusive than ever). The preservation of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended years of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland, is an article of faith among Democrats. “Democrats are bewildered by the logic of Brexit, to begin with,” Mr. Malloch Brown said. “There is a very strong Democratic Irish lobby, which will be really watching like a hawk that this doesn’t put Ireland at a disadvantage.” To some critics, Global Britain was never more than a marketing slogan. After all, they said, Britain has for centuries seen itself as a global player, one that punched above its weight economically and militarily, long after the end of the empire and throughout its 47 years of membership in Europe’s institutions. Today, in any event, powerful Johnson advisers, like Dominic Cummings, are more concerned about transforming British society than asserting its influence abroad. They know the Conservative Party won its 80-seat Parliamentary majority with the votes of working-class people in Britain’s Midlands and north, who care more about saving their jobs than striking trade deals. Since Mr. Johnson’s victory, he has used the Global Britain label mainly to put a gloss on a bureaucratic decision: merging two government ministries, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. The rationale, he said, is to align Britain’s foreign aid with its strategic and commercial interests. Some former diplomats said Mr. Johnson should not stop there. “If you really want a Global Britain, and you want the Foreign Office to have genuine policy heft, then bring in the trade department,” said Simon Fraser, who once headed the Foreign Office. There are grounds for hope about Britain’s role. Its diplomats are pushing a proposal to expand the Group of 7 to include three other big democracies, South Korea, India and Australia. Other countries have welcomed it as an alternative to Mr. Trump’s much-maligned plan to invite Russia back into the club. Britain remains a substantial military power, with nuclear weapons and a close intelligence relationship with the United States and other allies — known as the Five Eyes — that analysts say has recovered since the strains over Huawei. Mr. Johnson made waves this week with a front-page column in an Israeli newspaper, in which he urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to annex occupied territories in the West Bank. Mr. Netanyahu has held off for now. Britain’s opposition Labour Party has also swung back to the mainstream, after a period in which it seemed influenced by anti-American sentiment and was tainted by allegations of anti-Semitism. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, has emerged as a fresh new voice on Britain’s place in the world. If the pandemic finally punctures the illusion of a Global Britain, Britain can take solace in what has not changed. It remains a midsize country, anchored in the West, deeply intertwined with Europe and inescapably lashed to the United States. “It has made them realize that they couldn’t have their cake and eat it too,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “That is a delusion that has now been stripped away. They’ve been forced back into their more traditional space.”']",Post-Brexit Britain is going it alone at a time when globalization is in retreat. But a clash with China over Hong Kong has shown the limits of what it can do.
"As Neo-Nazis Seed Military Ranks, Germany Confronts ‘an Enemy Within’",2020-07-03,By Katrin Bennhold,"['CALW, Germany — As Germany emerged from its coronavirus lockdown in May, police commandos pulled up outside a rural property owned by a sergeant major in the special forces, the country’s most highly trained and secretive military unit. They brought a digger. The sergeant major’s nickname was Little Sheep. He was suspected of being a neo-Nazi. Buried in the garden, the police found two kilograms of PETN plastic explosives, a detonator, a fuse, an AK-47, a silencer, two knives, a crossbow and thousands of rounds of ammunition, much of it believed to have been stolen from the German military. They also found an SS songbook, 14 editions of a magazine for former members of the Waffen SS and a host of other Nazi memorabilia. “He had a plan,” said Eva Högl, Germany’s parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces. “And he is not the only one.” Germany has a problem. For years, politicians and security chiefs rejected the notion of any far-right infiltration of the security services, speaking only of “individual cases.” The idea of networks was dismissed. The superiors of those exposed as extremists were protected. Guns and ammunition disappeared from military stockpiles with no real investigation. The government is now waking up. Cases of far-right extremists in the military and the police, some hoarding weapons and explosives, have multiplied alarmingly. The nation’s top intelligence officials and senior military commanders are moving to confront an issue that has become too dangerous to ignore. The problem has deepened with the emergence of the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which legitimized a far-right ideology that used the arrival of more than a million migrants in 2015 — and more recently the coronavirus pandemic — to engender a sense of impending crisis. Most concerning to the authorities is that the extremists appear to be concentrated in the military unit that is supposed to be the most elite and dedicated to the German state, the special forces, known by their German acronym, the KSK. This week, Germany’s defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, took the drastic step of disbanding a fighting company in the KSK considered infested with extremists. Little Sheep, the sergeant major whose weapons stash was uncovered in May, was a member. Some 48,000 rounds of ammunition and 62 kilograms, or about 137 pounds, of explosives have disappeared from the KSK altogether, she said. Germany’s military counterintelligence agency is now investigating more than 600 soldiers for far-right extremism, out of 184,000 in the military. Some 20 of them are in the KSK, a proportion that is five times higher than in other units. But the German authorities are concerned that the problem may be far larger and that other security institutions have been infiltrated as well. Over the past 13 months, far-right terrorists have assassinated a politician, attacked a synagogue and shot dead nine immigrants and German descendants of immigrants. Thomas Haldenwang, president of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, has identified far-right extremism and terrorism as the “biggest danger to German democracy today.” In interviews I conducted over the course of the year with military and intelligence officials, and avowed far-right members themselves, they described nationwide networks of current and former soldiers and police officers with ties to the far right. In many cases, soldiers have used the networks to prepare for when they predict Germany’s democratic order will collapse. They call it Day X. Officials worry it is really a pretext for inciting terrorist acts, or worse, a putsch. “For far-right extremists, the preparation of Day X and its precipitation blend into one another,” Martina Renner, a lawmaker on the homeland security committee of the German Parliament, told me. The ties, officials say, sometimes reach deep into old neo-Nazi networks and the more polished intellectual scene of the so-called New Right. Extremists are hoarding weapons, maintaining safe houses, and in some cases keeping lists of political enemies. This week yet another case emerged, of a reservist, now suspended, who kept a list with cellphone numbers and addresses of 17 prominent politicians, who have been alerted. The case led to at least nine other raids across the country on Friday. Some German news media have referred to a “shadow army,” drawing parallels to the 1920s, when nationalist cells within the military hoarded arms, plotted coups and conspired to overthrow democracy. Most officials still reject this analogy. But the striking lack of understanding of the numbers involved, even at the highest levels of the government, has contributed to a deep unease. “Once they really started looking, they found a lot of cases,” said Konstantin von Notz, deputy president of the intelligence oversight committee in the German Parliament. “When you have hundreds of individual cases it begins to look like we have a structural problem. It is extremely worrying.” Mr. von Notz pointed out that Brendan Tarrant, who massacred 51 Muslim worshipers last year at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, had traveled Europe a year earlier and included an ominous line in his manifesto. “I would estimate the number of soldiers in European armed forces that also belong to nationalist groups to number in the hundreds of thousands, with just as many employed in law enforcement positions,” Mr. Tarrant had written. Investigators, Mr. von Notz said, “should take these words seriously.” But investigating the problem is itself fraught: Even the military counterintelligence agency, charged with monitoring extremism inside the armed forces, may be infiltrated. A high-ranking investigator in the extremism unit was suspended in June after sharing confidential material from the May raid with a contact in the KSK, who in turn passed it on to at least eight other soldiers, tipping them off that the agency might turn its attention to them next. “If the very people who are meant to protect our democracy are plotting against it, we have a big problem,” said Stephan Kramer, president of the domestic intelligence agency in the state of Thuringia. “How do you find them?” “These are battle-hardened men who know how to evade surveillance because they are trained in conducting surveillance themselves,” he added. “What we are dealing with is an enemy within.” The air inside the “shoot house” smelled acrid, so many live rounds had been fired. I was standing in the shooting range on the outskirts of the sleepy German town of Calw, in the Black Forest region, having been invited early this year for a rare visit inside the KSK’s base, the most heavily guarded in the country. A camouflaged soldier with a G36 assault rifle crouched along a broken door frame. Two shadows popped up. The soldier fired four times — head, torso, head, torso — then went on to systematically eliminate two dozen other “enemies.” He did not miss once. The KSK are Germany’s answer to the Navy Seals. But these days their commander, Gen. Markus Kreitmayr, an affable Bavarian who has done tours in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan, is a man divided between his loyalty to them and recognizing that he has a serious problem on his hands. The general was late for our interview. He had just spent four hours questioning a member of his unit about a party where half a dozen KSK soldiers were reported to have flashed Hitler salutes. “I can’t explain why there are allegedly so many cases of ‘far-right extremism’ in the military,” he said. The KSK is “clearly more affected than others, that appears to be a fact.” It was never easy to be a soldier in postwar Germany. Given its Nazi history and the destruction it foisted on Europe in World War II, the country maintains a conflicted relationship to its military. For decades, Germany tried to forge a force that represented a democratic society and its values. But in 2011 it abolished conscription and moved to a volunteer force. As a result, the military increasingly reflects not the broad society, but a narrower slice of it. General Kreitmayr said that “a big percentage” of his soldiers are eastern Germans, a region where the AfD does disproportionately well. Roughly half the men on the list of KSK members suspected of being far-right extremists are also from the east, he added. The general has called the current crisis in the unit “the most difficult phase in its history.” In our interview, he said that he could not rule out a significant degree of infiltration from the far right. “I don’t know if there is a shadow army in Germany,” he told me. “But I am worried,” he said, “and not just as the commander of the KSK, but as a citizen — that in the end something like that does exist and that maybe our people are part of it.” Officials talk of a perceptible shift “in values” among new recruits. In conversations, the soldiers themselves, who could not be identified under the unit’s guidelines, said that if there was a tipping point in the unit, it came with the migrant crisis of 2015. As hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan were making their way to Germany, the mood on the base was anxious, they recalled. “We are soldiers who are charged with defending this country and then they just opened the borders, no control,” one officer recalled. “We were at the limit.” It was in this atmosphere that a 30-year-old KSK soldier from Halle, in eastern Germany, set up a Telegram chat network for soldiers, police officers and others united in their belief that the migrants would destroy the country. His name was André Schmitt. But he goes by the nickname Hannibal. In a house in rural western Germany, behind a curtain of iron chains and past the crossbow in the hall, a dungeonlike room bathed in purple light opens into a bar area. An oversized image of a naked woman dominates the back wall. It was there that I met Mr. Schmitt early this year. He gave permission for his name to be used, but did not want the location disclosed or any photographs. He left active service last September after stolen training grenades were found at a building belonging to his parents. But, he says, he still has his network: “Special forces, intelligence, business executives, Freemasons,” he said. They meet here regularly. The house, he says, is owned by a wealthy supporter. “The forces are like a big family,” Mr. Schmitt told me, “everyone knows each other.” When he set up his Telegram chats in 2015, he did so geographically — north, south, east, west — just like the German military. In parallel, he ran a group called Uniter, an organization for security-related professionals that provides social benefits but also paramilitary training. Several former members of his chats are now under investigation by prosecutors for plotting terrorism. Some were ordering body bags. One faces trial. Mr. Schmitt’s situation is more complex. He acknowledged serving as an informer on the KSK for the military counterintelligence agency in mid-2017, when he met regularly with a liaison officer. Today the military is paying for him to get a business degree. He himself was never named a suspect. German officials denied that they protected him. But this week the domestic intelligence agency announced that it was placing his current network, Uniter, under surveillance. The authorities first stumbled onto his chats in 2017 while investigating a soldier in the network who was suspected of organizing a terror plot. Investigators are now looking into whether the chats and Uniter were the early skeleton of a nationwide far-right network that has infiltrated state institutions. As yet, they cannot say. The New York Times obtained police statements by Mr. Schmitt and others in his network related to the 2017 case. Initially, Mr. Schmitt and other members say, the chats were about sharing information, much of it about the supposed threats posed by migrants, which Mr. Schmitt admitted to the police he had inflated to “motivate” people. “It was about internal unrest because of sleeper cells and worldwide extremist groups, gang formations, terrorist threats,” Mr. Schmitt told the police.  The chats were popular among KSK soldiers. Mr. Schmitt said he counted 69 of his comrades in the network in 2015. A fellow KSK soldier, identified by investigators as Robert P., but known as Petrus, who ran two of the chats, told the police two years later that it might have been more than twice that: “I have to say, presumably half the unit was in there.” Soon the chats morphed from a platform for sharing information to one dedicated to preparing for Day X. Sipping mineral water, Mr. Schmitt described this as “war gaming.” He portrayed a Europe under threat from gangs, Islamists and Antifa. He called them “enemy troops on our ground.” His network helped members get ready to respond to what he portrayed as an inevitable conflict, sometimes acting on their own. “Day X is personal,” he said. “For one guy it’s this day, for another guy it’s another day.” ‘‘It’s the day you activate your plans,” he said. Chat members met in person, worked out what provisions and weapons to stockpile, and where to keep safe houses. Dozens were identified. One was the military base in Calw itself. They practiced how to recognize each other, using military code, at “pickup points” where members could gather on Day X. The sense of urgency grew.  On March 21, 2016, a chat member, identified only as Matze, wrote about a pickup point near Nuremberg. There were, he wrote, “sufficient weapons and ammo present to battle one’s way on.” Later that year, Mr. Schmitt sent a message to others in the chat network. In the previous 18 months, he wrote, they had gathered “2,000 like-minded people” in Germany and abroad. When I met him, Mr. Schmitt called it “a global like-minded brotherhood.”  He denies ever planning to bring about Day X, but he is still convinced that it will come, maybe sooner rather than later with the pandemic. “We know thanks to our sources in the banks and in the intelligence services that at the latest by the end of September the big economic crash will come,” he said in a follow-up phone call this week. “There will be insolvencies and mass unemployment,” he prophesied. “People will take to the street.” One night in 2017, Little Sheep, the sergeant major whose weapons stash was uncovered in May, was among about 70 KSK soldiers of Second Company who had gathered at a military shooting range. Investigators have identified him only as Philipp Sch. He and the others had organized a special leaving party for a lieutenant colonel, a man celebrated as a war hero for shooting his way out of an ambush in Afghanistan while carrying one of his men. The colonel, an imposing man covered in Cyrillic tattoos who enjoys cage-fighting in his spare time, had to complete an obstacle course. It involved hacking apart tree trunks and throwing severed pig heads. As a prize, his men had flown in a woman. But the colonel ended up dead drunk. The woman, rather than being his trophy, went to the police.  Standing by the fire with a handful of soldiers, she had witnessed them singing neo-Nazi lyrics and raising their right arm. One man stood out for his enthusiasm, she recalled in a televised report by the public broadcaster ARD. She called him the “Nazi grandpa.” Though just 45, “the Nazi grandpa” was Little Sheep, who had joined the KSK in 2001. In the three years since the party, the military counterintelligence service kept an eye on the sergeant major. But that did not stop the KSK from promoting him to the highest possible noncommissioned officer rank. The handling of the case fit a pattern, soldiers and officials say. In June, a KSK soldier addressed a 12-page letter to the defense minister, pleading for an investigation into what he described as a “toxic culture of acceptance” and “culture of fear” inside the unit. Tips about extremist comrades were “collectively ignored or even tolerated.” One of his instructors had likened the KSK to the Waffen SS, the soldier wrote. The instructor, a lieutenant colonel, was himself on the radar for far-right leanings since 2007, when he wrote a threatening email to another soldier. “You are being watched, no, not by impotent instrumentalized agencies, but by officers of a new generation, who will act when the times demand it,” it read. “Long live the holy Germany.” The KSK commander at the time did not suspend the lieutenant. He merely disciplined him. I asked General Kreitmayr, who took over command in 2018, about the case. “Look, today in the year 2020, with all the knowledge that we have, we look at the email from 2007 and say, ‘It’s obvious,’” he told me. “But at that time we only thought: Man, what’s wrong with him? He should pull himself together.” The back door of the main building on the base in Calw leads into a long corridor known as the “hallway of history,” a collection of memorabilia gathered over the KSK’s nearly 25 years that includes a stuffed German shepherd, Kato, who parachuted from 30,000 feet with a commando team. Conspicuously missing is any mention of a disgraced former KSK commander, Gen. Reinhard Günzel, who was dismissed after he wrote a 2003 letter in support of an anti-Semitic speech by a conservative lawmaker. General Günzel subsequently published a book called “Secret Warriors.” In it, he placed the KSK in the tradition of a notorious special forces unit under the Nazis that committed numerous war crimes, including massacres of Jews. He has been a popular speaker at far-right events. “What you basically have is one of the founding commanders of the KSK becoming a prominent ideologue of the New Right,” said Christian Weissgerber, a former soldier who has written a book about his own experience of being a neo-Nazi in the military. The New Right, which encompasses youth activists, intellectuals and the AfD, worries General Kreitmayr. The lawmaker whose anti-Semitic comments led to General Günzel’s firing all those years ago now sits in the German Parliament for the AfD. “You have leading representatives of political parties like the AfD, who say things that not only make you sick but that are clearly far-right, radical ideology,” General Kreitmayr said. Soldiers were not immune to this cultural shift in the country, he said. Just recently a fellow general had become a mayoral candidate for the AfD. Several former soldiers represent the party in Parliament. Down the hill from the shoot house is the Green Saloon, a cross between a boardroom and a bar. It is dominated by a vast oil painting depicting KSK soldiers and their German shepherd successfully attacking a Taliban hide-out. It is a scene familiar to several soldiers who had gathered the day I was there. But the soldiers I spoke with questioned the strategy behind a war that has run for two decades with few concrete results, except an increase in migration at home.  “My girls asked me: ‘Why do you have to go to Afghanistan when there are children from the Kunduz in our class?’” recounted one officer. “I did not have an answer.” When he took a delegation of KSK soldiers to meet with political parties in Parliament, he asked them the same question. “They did not have an answer, either,” he said. Only one lawmaker made a clear statement, he said. He was from the AfD. “He said we should have left a long time ago,” the officer recalled. Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.']",
Trial of 20 Saudis in Jamal Khashoggi Killing Opens in Turkey,2020-07-03,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey opened a trial into the death of the Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul on Friday, accusing 20 Saudi citizens in absentia, in a case that friends and human rights officials welcomed as an important step in advancing the search for justice in his killing. None of the accused were present for the trial — Saudi Arabia has declined to extradite them — and it was unclear whether the court could legally pursue the case without defendants. Nonetheless, the start of the proceedings was seen as a sign that Turkey and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan\xa0— who personally knew Mr. Khashoggi and was outraged that the killing took place in Istanbul — are determined to pursue those responsible and even implicate the Saudi kingdom’s day-to-day ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Khashoggi was killed when he visited the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to obtain papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. He never emerged from the meeting. His body was dismembered, and his remains have never been found. Mr. Khashoggi, 59, a Saudi dissident, fled the kingdom and wrote columns for The Washington Post that were critical of his country’s leadership. His killing undermined the image of Prince Mohammed as a young ruler working to open up the kingdom’s economy and society. The Saudi government has prosecuted 11 men for carrying out the killing, and sentenced five of them to death in December, but did not find any senior officials responsible. The Turkish indictment accuses 18 men of carrying out murder with monstrous intent and inflicting grave torment. Two others, both close aides to Prince Mohammed — Ahmed al-Asiri, the former deputy head of Saudi general intelligence; and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the crown prince — were indicted on incitement to murder with monstrous intent and inflicting grave torment.  Ms. Cengiz described in testimony to the court how she first realized something was wrong as she waited for Mr. Khashoggi outside the consulate. “Someone of 25 to 30 years old came out,” she said, according to Turkish reporters who were inside the court. “He had an anxiety-inducing, fearful facial expression.” “He said ‘I checked the rooms, there’s nobody,’ but he couldn’t look at my face,” she added. “At that moment, I experienced a fear I had never experienced before in my life. It wasn’t only fear, it was horror.” She named a consulate employee called Ekrem Sultan as the person who had called Mr. Khashoggi to attend a meeting on Oct. 2. “They summoned him with great betrayal and trickery,” she said. “When they killed Jamal, they hurt something very big,” she concluded. “They hurt the image of Islam and justice.” Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Mr. Erdogan and close friend of Mr. Khashoggi, described how Mr. Khashoggi’s criticism of Prince Mohammed and his policies, in particular his prosecution of the war in Yemen and boycott of Qatar, had forced him to flee Saudi Arabia. Mr. Khashoggi’s role as the head of advocacy group Democracy for the Arab World Now irritated the Saudi leadership still further, Mr. Aktay said. “The activities of the association made the government of Saudi Arabia angry,” he noted. “To them, democracy is like a curse.” Mr. Aktay said that Mr. al-Qahtani had communicated with Mr. Khashoggi on WhatsApp and told him that he needed to stop talking and return to Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Aktay said he had advised his friend not to go to the Oct. 2 meeting at the Saudi Consulate. “I said it might be a trap, but he did not take my warning seriously,” he said. Seven other Turkish witnesses who worked at the consulate also took the stand on Friday. Several workers said they were ordered not to go to the consul’s residence, a building down the street from the consulate, that day. Zeki Demir, a technician, said he was called to the consul’s residence at 2 p.m. on Oct. 2 to light the gas oven in the garden used for barbecues. “There was an air of panic,” he said. “It was as if they wanted me to leave as soon as possible. I left after lighting the oven.” Turkish lawyers representing the defendants said that they had not been able to reach them for consultations, but they said that their clients denied the claims. The board of judges announced that the next hearing would be held Nov. 24. The Turkish trial offers the closest chance for justice available in the Khashoggi killing, said Agnès Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, who arrived in Istanbul on Thursday to attend. “It is going to give a different meaning and a more rigorous approach to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, which is what we should expect from a trial,” she said on the eve of the proceedings. Despite Turkey’s reputation in recent years for poor application of judicial standards — critics have cited the justice system’s lack of independence and the abuse of defendants’ rights among other criticisms — Ms. Callamard said she hoped the proceedings would reveal more about the chain of command in the killing. Ms. Callamard concluded after a five-month investigation that Mr. Khashoggi’s death had been carefully planned and endorsed by high-level Saudi officials. C.I.A. officials have concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing. Ms. Callamard said she hoped the trial would reveal what investigators had found in Mr. Khashoggi’s cellphone and computer, and whether the devices had been hacked which could indicate intent to do him harm. She said the proceedings had a broader significance. “It is important also for the rest of the world — we have to keep insisting that no one can kill a journalist and get away with it lightly,” she said. “We need to keep insisting that he pays a price,” she added of Prince Mohammed. The Turkish indictment alleges that Mr. Khashoggi was “considered by Saudi officials and authorities as a threat against the government of Saudi Arabia, because of his articles, speeches in the meetings and conferences he joined, and his dissident acts for the change of the government.” The intention of the Saudi authorities was to bring him back to the kingdom and if he did not agree, to kill him, the indictment states. On issuing the indictment in March, the Istanbul prosecutor said in a statement that it was based on evidence from cellphone location records of the accused, records of their entry and exit from Turkey, and their presence at the consulate. Evidence was also drawn from searches of their hotel rooms, the consulate and the consul’s residence; from Mr. Khashoggi’s cellphone, laptop and iPad; and from witness statements, the statement added. The indictment names 54 witnesses, including 26 Turkish members of staff of the consulate and the consul’s residence, among them drivers, clerks, translators, cooks, cleaners and a tea server. Mr. Erdogan is pursuing a proxy war on several political and regional levels with the Saudi crown prince — although he has made a point of showing respect to the Saudi king — and will be seeking a verdict that damages his rival, said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “He is going to use the trial to embarrass the crown prince by reaching a very different set of conclusions,” Mr. Cagaptay said, “and also having his own verdict so that the case does not end with the Saudi verdict.”']",Supporters of the slain journalist expressed hope that the proceedings would offer a chance for justice. The defendants are to be tried in absentia.
"In Japan, the Message of Anti-Racism Protests Fails to Hit Home",2020-07-01,By Motoko Rich and Hikari Hida,"['TOKYO — As protests were spreading around the globe in response to George Floyd’s killing by the police, Sierra Todd, an African-American undergraduate in Japan, organized a march last month in Tokyo to show solidarity with American demonstrators. She said she hoped it would prompt Japanese marchers to think about racism in their own country, too. “Of course, we want to talk about American issues, and Black Lives Matter is an American thing,” said Ms. Todd, 19, who is studying at Temple University’s campus in Tokyo. “But we also do live in Japan.” A backlash quickly followed. Critics on social media accused participants of disregarding the risks of spreading the coronavirus. An interview with Ms. Todd posted on YouTube elicited comments that “This is an American issue” and “Please do this in your own country.” With images of America’s racial strife rolling across television screens, some in Japan have insisted that institutional racism is a faraway problem. That, activists and scholars say, is keeping the public from more fully seizing the moment to reckon with entrenched discrimination against marginalized groups in Japan. A vocal faction of Japanese conservatives endorses racist notions of blood-based purity. And the largely homogeneous population has often resisted acknowledging difference or engaging in the kind of introspection about racism and inequality that is playing out in the United States. “In essence, Japanese people don’t have a lot of experience of seeing other races,” said Yasumasa Fujinaga, a professor of American studies at Japan Women’s University. “So they don’t think racism exists.” But Japan has a longstanding history of discrimination against minorities, including the descendants of Koreans brought to Japan as forced labor before and during World War II; Indigenous groups like the Ainu of the northernmost island, Hokkaido; those whose lineage traces back to a feudal class of outcasts known as buraku; and mixed-race individuals. The mistreatment of mixed-race people through their school years and beyond has drawn particular attention as a growing number of biracial celebrities have spoken out. In an emotional testimonial posted on Twitter last month, Louis Okoye, a half-Japanese, half-Nigerian professional baseball player, described how he had often been bullied as a child in Japan because of the color of his skin. “I would look out from the balcony of our home and think, if I jumped off and was born again, maybe I can come back as a normal Japanese person,” he wrote in the post, which has been retweeted 52,000 times. Most of the comments were overwhelmingly supportive. Still, the conversation is shifting only gradually in Japan, and the resistance can be stiff. When Bako Nguasong and V. Athena Lisane, English teachers in Fukuoka — the largest city on the southern island of Kyushu — organized a march there last month, one poster wrote on Twitter that “I won’t feel any mercy if these people are told to get deported by the local Japanese.” Ms. Nguasong, 36, left behind a home and a career in Washington and moved to Japan two years ago because she was weary of fearing for her safety as a Black woman in America. “I knew it wasn’t going to be diverse, but I also knew I wasn’t going to be afraid for my life,” said Ms. Nguasong, who previously worked as a mental health coordinator for former inmates. She did find physical security in Japan, where crime rates are low and police killings are rare. But she could not escape racism, even if in Japan it takes a less violent form. Ms. Nguasong said that she had noticed looks and whispers from local Japanese people, and that passengers had avoided sitting next to her on trains. Two older women, she said, once groped her breasts in an elevator in apparent surprise over her figure. “It’s not the same insidious nature,” Ms. Nguasong said. “But racism still exists in Japan.” A glaring reminder of that came last month when NHK, the public broadcaster, aired a segment about the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. A clip showed African-Americans as overly muscled, music-playing, looting caricatures, and presented the protests as the product of frustration with economic disparity and the coronavirus, without mentioning police brutality. After pushback on Twitter, NHK apologized and took the clip down. The country’s insularity has generated not just overt and unconscious bias against people abroad, but also a distrust of foreigners who come to Japan. As the country slowly opens its doors to outside workers to help confront a demographic crisis, improving its treatment of foreigners may be crucial to Japan’s future. But according to a 2017 Ministry of Justice survey, 30 percent of foreigners in Japan said they had been the target of discrimination, with many citing issues getting jobs or housing. A candidate in the Tokyo governor’s race, Makoto Sakurai, is running on a platform that includes the slogan “abolish welfare for foreigners.” At the same time, though, some Japanese show a fascination with foreigners, including Black pop culture. That has led to accusations of cultural appropriation, and left some African-Americans chagrined that more people in Japan don’t reflect on their own racism. “Japanese people who like Black culture like everything that is stereotypically Black, like gold teeth,” said Farah Albritton, 28, an English teacher in Fukuoka who is from Brooklyn. “Or they will change their hair to be Afro-textured or put in cornrows.” Ms. Albritton has experienced incidences of racism in Japan, such as when a man in the street shouted “you’re so gross,” or when a casting agent for a modeling job asked her to demonstrate a “Black handshake” at an audition. She said she was offended that Japanese acquaintances who emulate Black pop stars have shown little or no public support for Black Lives Matter. “You are taking part in our culture, and we have accepted you into our culture,” Ms. Albritton said. “And you can’t even post about our friends who are dying — the people who are inspiring you.” Compared to Black Lives Matter marches in France or Britain, which have drawn tens of thousands of people, the rallies in Japan have been modest in size. The largest, in Tokyo, drew about 3,500 people, with many participants having some foreign roots. Some scholars worry that the Japanese public only sees racism abroad without reflecting on it closer to home. “If they are just saying, ‘Oh, gee, Blacks in America are facing horrible things and we have to help them,’ that is almost like charity,” said Haeng-ja Chung, a professor of anthropology at Okayama University and an ethnic Korean born in Japan. “Before we accuse other societies, we have to stop and think: ‘How about us?’” The tennis champion Naomi Osaka, the daughter of a Haitian-American father and a Japanese mother whose superstar status has inspired a reassessment of traditional Japanese identity, has called out those on social media who claim there is no racism in Japan. In one Twitter post, she reminded followers of an incident when Japanese comedians said she needed “bleach” because she was “too sunburned.” Hiromi Okamura, 57, who attended the Black Lives Matter march in Tokyo last month, said it had helped her think about how “unconscious actions are what often leads to prejudice.” “I think that there is potentially some deep-seated racism” in Japan, said Ms. Okamura. “What’s important is to understand that, and carefully communicate it.” Some Japanese are working to draw more attention to prejudice against foreigners. After video emerged on social media showing Tokyo police officers roughing up a Turkish immigrant, Ramazan Celik, during a traffic stop, Kento Suzuki, who volunteers at a detention center where asylum seekers and other foreigners are held, organized two protests. “I have been thinking that Japan is a racist society from a very long time ago,” said Mr. Suzuki, 28. “There are a lot of people becoming more involved in the movement to help immigrants in Japan.” Still, Mr. Suzuki worries about cases in which asylum seekers and immigrants have said that they were abused or neglected while in detention. “I feel hope and also dread,” he said. “It’s a constant battle between these two emotions.”']",A view that institutional racism is a faraway problem is keeping the country from more fully confronting entrenched discrimination.
Our Supreme Court Correspondent on This Week’s Abortion Ruling,2020-07-03,By Alisha Haridasani Gupta,"['Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Louisiana law that required doctors who perform abortions in the state to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. This was the first major abortion case before the Supreme Court since President Trump added two new conservative justices to the bench — and was one piece in the anti-abortion movement’s long-term, sustained effort to limit access to the procedure through a latticework of state laws. As of June, there were at least 16 abortion cases before United States appeals courts, the last step before the Supreme Court, according to lawyers at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Many of these laws could present a more direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established federal protection for abortion, than the Louisiana and Texas laws. In an interview, The Times’s Supreme Court reporter, Adam Liptak, discussed what Monday’s ruling means for the future of Roe v. Wade. The conversation has been edited for clarity. Adam, were you surprised by this outcome? I was somewhat surprised. There was good reason to think the court would uphold the Louisiana law restricting abortion in the state because we have two new justices appointed by President Trump since the last time the court addressed the issue in 2016. And because in 2016, Chief Justice John Roberts dissented from the ruling striking down the almost identical law in Texas. So those three votes you would have thought would have been on the anti-abortion side. The departure in 2018 of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was in the majority in the 2016 decision, also suggested that this was going to be a loss for supporters of abortion rights. But there was a nuance in the ruling, right? Chief Justice Roberts said that the Texas case was “wrongly decided” but that he went with it anyway because of precedent — not because he’d changed his mind about the facts. What does that mean down the line? He said he was voting as he did because he was bound by the earlier precedent. That suggests that different kinds of abortion restrictions could well survive Supreme Court review. And there are lots of states using creative measures to try to restrict abortion. In endorsing a high level of respect for precedent, it might suggest that the chief justice would be willing to uphold earlier decisions on the ultimate question of Roe v. Wade — the constitutional right to an abortion. Given the precedent of Roe v. Wade and the chief justice’s emphasis on precedent, is abortion access really threatened? How high is the bar for the Supreme Court to overturn a constitutional right? Judges and justices have complicated formulas about when it’s appropriate to overturn a precedent. They look at things like: Was it egregiously wrong when it was decided? Has it turned out to be workable in practice? Have people, in this case women, come to rely on it? You’ll find different judges giving different answers to those questions. Respect for precedent is governed by a complicated web of principles that different people can apply in different ways. There’s another case concerning contraception that will be decided in the coming days. Tell me about it. This is the latest in an ongoing battle about regulations under the Affordable Care Act, which guaranteed free contraception coverage to most women workers. It has always been complicated because the initial regulation set a carve-out for houses of worship, including churches, temples and mosques. Most other employers had to provide the coverage. And the Supreme Court, in a series of decisions, has allowed other exceptions and accommodations. But when the Trump administration came in, it issued its own regulations, which allowed just about anybody — any employer with religious or moral objections to providing contraception coverage — to opt out. And the question before the court is whether those regulations are lawful. And which way do you think the court will rule? I suspect that just as the initial regulations were not in the Affordable Care Act statute itself but adopted by the Obama administration, a majority of the court is likely to say that the Trump administration is also entitled to adopt different regulations, at least for religious objectors. In the hearing for the contraception case, were the justices stumbling over the definition of “moral”? Did you hear that come through? Because of Covid-19, I listened to the hearing on the telephone — this was one of the court’s recent telephone arguments — and the justices did not really explore how courts are meant to decide what counts as a valid moral objection. But the lawyer challenging the new regulations certainly said the concept was vague and amorphous. On the one hand, access to abortion has been protected, but access to contraception might be restricted. That paints quite a mixed picture. Yes. As a general matter, what you say is right. But you could sort of harmonize the two decisions if they come out to be as we’ve sketched out. Women have to pay for abortions. The question in the contraception case is not whether you can have access to contraception but whether you must pay for it. And I don’t mean to minimize the burden that paying for contraception can be, but they’re not entirely on the same plane. What does it say that the Supreme Court was even willing to take up these two cases together, especially the abortion case, so soon after the 2016 ruling? It does seem weird that the Supreme Court should revisit an issue on the identical question after only a four-year gap with a change of personnel on the court — that looks pretty ugly. But in its defense, a federal appeals court had sustained the Louisiana law and seemingly thumbed its nose at the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision. So the court really had little choice but to take up the abortion case. As far as the contraception case, a federal appeals court effectively struck down the Trump administration regulation, and when that happens, it’s not unusual for the Supreme Court to step in and say: If someone’s going to strike down a major executive action, it ought to be the Supreme Court.

"As China Strengthens Grip on Hong Kong, Taiwan Sees a Threat",2020-07-01,By Javier C. Hernández and Steven Lee Myers,"['TAIPEI, Taiwan — China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has long tried to convince Taiwan that unification was a historical inevitability, alternately enticing the democratic island with economic incentives while bluntly warning that any move toward formal independence would be answered with military force. Now, the incentives are gone and the warnings seem more ominous following Mr. Xi’s swift move to strengthen China’s grip on Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory that only last year he held out as a model for Taiwan’s future. The new security rules for Hong Kong that China passed this week — without input from the city’s Beijing-backed leadership — have made Mr. Xi’s promise of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework seem hollow. And it has raised fears that China will move more aggressively to bring Taiwan, too, under its control. “Hong Kong has become less free, so our sense of fear has increased,” said Chen Po-wei, a Taiwanese lawmaker who supports independence. “Because of China’s nature, there is a high possibility of conflict.” Mr. Xi, China’s most powerful leader in decades, has shown a penchant for provocative actions, especially lately, with the world distracted by the devastating spread of the coronavirus. In recent weeks, China has buzzed Taiwan’s territorial airspace almost daily. It accused Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, of carrying out a “separatist plot” by speaking at an international democracy forum. It has warned the Taiwan government to stop providing shelter to Hong Kong political activists, who are flocking to what they call the last bastion of freedom in the Chinese-speaking world. “Part of the game is making people in Taiwan feel helpless and trying to direct their frustration against leaders in Taipei,” said Matthew P. Funaiole, a senior fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Mr. Funaiole said Beijing was also looking at how the United States and other countries would respond. “We’ve seen plenty of examples of China testing and prodding and doing just enough to stay below the threshold of eliciting a strong response from the U.S.,” he added. The repeated pledges by Ms. Tsai to preserve the island’s sovereignty now set the stage for even greater tensions in the months ahead. Mr. Xi’s attempts to rein in dissent in Hong Kong have only heightened a sense of crisis and galvanized pro-independence forces who have pressed Ms. Tsai to do more.  Ms. Tsai won re-election in a landslide in January over Han Kuo-yu, a candidate who had pushed for closer relations with China. Last month, voters in the city of Kaohsiung, where Mr. Han was the mayor, recalled him. A survey in May by Academia Sinica, a research institute, found that only 23 percent of Taiwan residents regarded China as a “friend of Taiwan,” compared with 38 percent a year earlier. “We are very disappointed that China is not able to carry out its promises,” Ms. Tsai said on Tuesday after the Hong Kong security law was passed. “It proves that ‘one country, two systems’ is not feasible.” The possibility of a military conflict between China and Taiwan remains remote, experts say, because the costs for Beijing would be extraordinary, including significant casualties and damage to its international standing. Yet the two sides are moving farther and farther apart, with little appetite for compromise. Trade and tourism have dropped significantly, as Ms. Tsai’s government has sought to deepen economic ties, if not diplomatic ones, with sympathetic nations. As always, Taiwan’s defense turns on the question of American support. The United States is committed to providing help for Taiwan to defend itself, and the Trump administration has cleared the way for the sale of weapons to the island, including F-16 fighter jets. Doubts have emerged about President Trump’s personal commitment to Taiwan, especially as he tries to hold together a trade deal with China. In his new memoir, John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, said the president had repeatedly belittled the island’s significance compared to the mainland. “One of Trump’s favorite comparisons was to point to the tip of one of his Sharpies and say, ‘This is Taiwan,’ then point to the Resolute desk and say, ‘This is China,’” Mr. Bolton wrote, referring to the desk in the Oval Office. “So much for American commitments and obligations to another democratic ally.” The lack of vocal support from Mr. Trump — who shortly after his election took a telephone call from Ms. Tsai, infuriating Beijing — has contributed to fears in Taiwan that China might be emboldened to take aggressive action. Ms. Tsai, first elected in 2016, has been cautious in her approach toward China. When Taiwan announced last month that it would expand efforts to provide refuge to activists fleeing Hong Kong, for example, the government avoided giving too many details, to avoid angering Beijing. Even so, Ms. Tsai’s profile has risen since her re-election in January. It has been bolstered by Taiwan’s successful containment of the coronavirus, which she and other officials have loudly touted around the world as evidence that democratic systems can be effective in the face of a public health crisis. While the crackdown in Hong Kong has unified Taiwan’s famously fractious political parties against the mainland, some have urged the governing Democratic Progressive Party, which is highly critical of Beijing, to avoid escalating military tensions. “If Taiwan fights against the Chinese Communist Party, the United States won’t come to rescue us,” said Hsu Chih-rong, a lawmaker from the opposition party, the Kuomintang. “Taiwan cannot afford such a risk.” Among Chinese nationalists, Hong Kong and Taiwan are seen as the two remaining strongholds of opposition to Mr. Xi’s rule in the Chinese-speaking world. Some mainland officials and scholars argue that now is the time to signal that Beijing will not tolerate resistance to its policies. Tian Feilong, a professor of law at Beihang University in Beijing who studies Hong Kong and Taiwan, said the new security rules would “cut off all the links of confluence between Hong Kong independence and Taiwan independence.” He added that unification with Taiwan remained a priority for China’s leader. “The weight of the Taiwan problem in his heart, the urgency to solve it and the sense of mission will be even stronger” for Mr. Xi, he said. Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, once bet that greater economic ties between the mainland and Taiwan would bring the two sides closer and make unification more palatable.  The mainland offered incentives to businessmen to trade and invest across the strait, even while it tried to build support among private organizations. A defector to Australia last year claimed that China’s military intelligence even funneled payments to Taiwan media organizations and politicians. Ms. Tsai, for her part, has refused the condition that China has set for improved relations: acceptance of China’s view that the island is an inexorable part of a greater Chinese nation under the Communist Party. Beijing has since tried to punish Taiwan economically, including by banning some tourism to the island. Increasingly, Mr. Xi has abandoned efforts to court Taiwan through economic and cultural means, instead warning that the mainland’s patience is limited. “People who might genuinely want to engage can’t feel safe engaging anymore with the P.R.C.,” said Shelley Rigger, a professor of political science at Davidson College who studies Taiwan, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “Whenever we see that kind of impatience and assertiveness and lack of consideration for external disapproval, that doesn’t bode well for Taiwan,” she added. In recent weeks, there has been a marked increase in military operations around the island’s territorial waters. In response, Ms. Tsai has tried to project strength, appearing alongside officers at a conferral ceremony and calling on the military to remain vigilant. During past moments of tension with the mainland, some Taiwanese moved overseas or transferred their assets to foreign accounts, fearing a conflict might erupt. This time, however, a desire to preserve and protect the island’s identity has brought a sense of solidarity, some activists say. “Instead of fleeing, people stand in unity,” said Freddy Lim, a pro-independence lawmaker. “We are very united and angry, but we’re thinking about how to show our unity, our progress in national defense and our determination.” Javier C. Hernández reported from Taipei, Taiwan, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul. Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting from Taipei.

Who Will Recover Faster From the Virus? Europe or the U.S.?,2020-07-01,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — After the devastating financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the United States recovered much more quickly than Europe, which suffered a double-dip recession. This time, many economists say that Europe may have the edge. The main reason America did well was the rapid response of the government and the flexible nature of the American economy, quick both to fire workers but also to hire them again. Europe, with built-in social insurance, tries to keep workers from layoffs through subsidies to  employers, making it harder to fire and more expensive to rehire. But this is a different kind of collapse, a mandated shutdown in response to a pandemic, driving down both supply and demand simultaneously. And that difference creates the possibility that the European response, freezing the economy in place, might work better this time. “It’s an important debate,’’ said Jean Pisani-Ferry, a senior economist with Bruegel in Brussels and the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “This isn’t a normal recession, and there’s a lot you don’t know, especially if the virus comes back.’’ By now, the coronavirus has turned the world into a giant laboratory of competing systems, each with its own way of fighting the virus and mitigating its economic damage. The contrast between Europe and the United States has been particularly stark. Much of Europe resorted to strict lockdowns that mostly beat back the virus but capsized economies. In the United States, President Trump has prioritized getting the economy moving even as infections multiply. Nearly everywhere governments had to step in with support as the emphasis shifted to relief and recovery. The common denominator is debt. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting that global debt will increase this year by 19 percent relative to gross domestic product. But the contrast is not only about different systems. It is also about different wagers on how the pandemic will proceed — which will make all the difference to how long government relief can be sustained. Already the different approaches are yielding different outcomes, not only in terms of infections and deaths — where the United States leads the world — but also jobs, with unemployment soaring in U.S. while it remains largely stable in Europe. The United States has provided an early burst of funds for taxpayers and company support, but is effectively leaving it up to the market to reallocate jobs. European governments, faced with an artificial shutdown, rather than a traditional fiscal crisis, have chosen to try to “freeze” their economies, in the hope of resuming them quickly. They have bet on a fairly rapid recovery, opting to try to preserve jobs as much as possible through wage subsidies, often up to 80 percent of salary, and for part-time work. But if the pandemic goes on too long, or returns in an extended second wave, European governments are unlikely to extend such support for much longer. Already, said Mr. Pisani-Ferry, “everyone is pulling back a bit.” Some plans were very generous and “there is a question of balance — you want to avoid fraud and avoid companies keeping people on furlough if there’s no chance of rehiring them.’’ Many European countries have adopted what is known in Germany as ‘‘kurzarbeit,’’ in which firms promise not to lay anyone off but to share the work, while the government makes up much of the lost income. “So far Europe is doing quite well, with a huge increase in unemployment in the U.S. and not so much here,’’ said Guntram Wolff, director of Bruegel, an economic think tank. “If what we see is temporary, if we return to an economic system much like before, then kurzarbeit is the right response,’’ he said. ‘‘But if you think there will be longer-lasting shifts, if you need to reallocate, then the U.S., which is more agile, may be better off.’’ Initial American spending was massive — up to $2.7 trillion in March and April (about 13 percent of gross domestic product) to provide economic relief to individuals, firms and states. It was the largest economic stimulus in American history. It was also several times bigger than Europe’s package, which in France, for example, was only 2 percent, Mr. Pisani-Ferry said. Still, “the European response was better — simpler and more effective in terms of the use of public funds,’’ he said. The reason is Europe’s existing social welfare system. Its “automatic stabilizers’’ kick in to support the poor and unemployed, without the need, as in the United States, to pass ad hoc legislation. The American response was a broad rather than targeted attack, with large amounts of money handed out quickly but indiscriminately and thus inefficiently by the Treasury, which had no system in place to do otherwise. The main point was to get money into the system so it did not shut down entirely, so consumer demand would continue. But the Treasury ended up giving a lot to those who did not need it — including to many dead people — and on a first-come, first-serve basis to employers, some of whom did not need the help. But even that huge spending, largely targeted at individuals rather than employers, did not prevent massive layoffs. Washington is relying on unemployment insurance and increased those payments by $600 a week, but that runs out at the end of July. Without any certainty about what comes next, consumers will hesitate to spend, slowing any recovery. The rise in unemployment in America has been roughly five times that in France, Mr. Pisani-Ferry wrote in a paper with Jérémie Cohen-Setton. “As an immediate crisis response, the French (and European) approach undoubtedly offered a bigger bang for the buck.’’ But such European generosity to prop up the existing system may slow job growth compared to the more flexible, insecure American system, where it’s easier to hire and fire, argues Megan Greene, an economist at Harvard’s Kennedy School. “Labor market flexibility creates more opportunities for U.S. workers, usually leading to a faster recovery after a downturn,’’ she wrote. That has helped America bounce back faster in traditional recessions, but this is a different kind of recession, a sudden freeze with no obvious exit. “The United States had a much larger fiscal stimulus, but as usual, fewer automatic stabilizers, so the discretionary part was bigger,’’ said Lucrezia Reichlin, professor of economics at London Business School. “So in America there is a bigger debate about who is winning and who is losing.’’ Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics pointed out that because most Europeans don’t have to worry about getting their salaries, the “lockdown was also easier to sustain.’’ That was especially true, he said, for “the critical eight weeks, mid-March to mid-May,’’ when Europe largely succeeded in snuffing out the rapid advance of the virus, which is continuing to spread in the United States at a record pace. In the United States, “there are a lot of voices clamoring to open up or it will cost us the economy, since there are millions of Americans that need to work to put food on the table,’’ he said. “So Americans were willing to take chances that Europeans did not have to.’’ A lot will depend now on the course of the pandemic. No doubt, Europeans continue to argue fiercely over the size and shape of their coronavirus recovery fund and how it will be distributed, but by now there is no doubt that the money will be in the pipeline. If Europe is lucky and can engineer a broad, comprehensive lockdown but a short one, then whenever that money arrives next year will help the economy grow, especially if recovery is slow, weak and prolonged.  Last week, Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank, which stepped in with a massive program to guarantee new government debt, said: “We probably have passed the lowest point,’’ but given all the unknowns, “I say that with some trepidation.” In the United States, on the other hand, the uncertainty of the government response is itself a factor. “Despite being one country,” Ms. Reichlin said, “the U.S. is coming out much more fragmented than Europe.’’ If American consumers remain apprehensive, or their unemployment benefits run out,  or if there is a continued rise in illnesses or a second coronavirus wave, the American recovery could be short-circuited. “We live with the idea that the U.S. has an ability to rebound that is almost unlimited,” Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador, told The Atlantic. “For the first time, I’m starting to have some doubts.”']","The United States, with its readiness to fire and hire, normally bounces back faster after a recession. This time, though, Europe’s model may be better."
Suspension From European Airspace Is Latest Blow to Pakistan’s Troubled Airline,2020-07-01,By Salman Masood,"['ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The European Union’s announcement that Pakistan International Airlines would be barred from flying into Europe for at least six months is the latest blow to the country’s national flag carrier, which has been mired in financial and administrative troubles and has come under scrutiny after a crash in May that killed 97 people. The decision on Tuesday by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency to temporarily ban Pakistan International Airlines followed revelations last month by the Pakistani aviation minister, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, that a large number of pilots there and at other airlines had dubious credentials. Pakistan International has now grounded 150 of its pilots and an inquiry is underway to review their licenses and other documentation. The reports of the questionable credentials have put Pakistani pilots under international scrutiny. Earlier this week, Vietnam grounded 27 Pakistani pilots who fly for Vietnamese airlines. The United Arab Emirates has also sought verification of the credentials of Pakistani airline employees. The European air safety agency said the airline “is currently not capable to certify and oversee its operators and aircraft in accordance with applicable international standards.” The May 22 crash of an Airbus A-320 carrying families set to reunite after two months in lockdown to spend the Eid al-Fitr holiday together was the latest in a series of air disasters for the airline. The pilots had disregarded several warnings that they were flying too low on the approach to the Karachi airport, according to the investigation into the crash. The airline has long been criticized as being overstaffed, has a reputation for lax quality control, and many appointments are seen as a result of political pressure or nepotism. Repeated efforts by successive governments to make it financially viable have failed, and it is running into a loss of around 6 billion rupees, or about $36 million, per month, officials say. Pakistani officials have described its financial situation as a “bottomless pit.” The crisis at Pakistan International Airlines has touched union workers to its top executives, who have been removed regularly over corruption charges or the propriety of their appointments. In 2018 the Pakistani Supreme Court removed Musharraf Rasool as chief executive because he didn’t meet the criteria for the job and lacked aviation experience; his replacement, Bernd Hildenbrand, a German national, was also forced out over similar accusations and corruption allegations. The current chief executive, Arshad Malik, serves as an air marshal in the Pakistani Air Force. He was brought in with high hopes in 2018 to revive and revamp the national carrier, but he came under a cloud himself this year when the Supreme Court raised questions over the legality of his appointment. He was allowed to continue working. Critics of the airline say that the pilots have unionized and resist efforts to overhaul work rules. Mr. Khan, the aviation minister, told Parliament last month that of around 860 pilots working for Pakistani air carriers, 260 had fraudulent licenses. The examination system for pilot licenses was changed in 2012 by the Civil Aviation Authority, which itself has been accused of failing to uphold regulatory standards. The new process involves taking several theoretical tests — and many pilots have reportedly tried to get around it by either cheating or paying others to take the tests in their place. Capt. Chaudhry Salman, the head of the Pakistan Airline Pilots’ Association, disputed Mr. Khan’s claims in a news conference in Karachi last week. “There is no truth to these allegations,” Mr. Salman said. The pilots have their own set of complaints and grievances. Last year, representatives for Pakistan International pilots accused the airline of violating safety rules and putting the pilots at risk. They said that pilots were overworked, lacked sufficient sleep and suffered from fatigue, and said that the airline was scheduling flights in a way that put aircraft and passengers’ safety at risk. Former Pakistan International staff members said they were saddened by the dismal state of affairs at the airline. Hamood Alam, a former official who is now working with another airline in the Middle East, said in an interview that he had never felt so much “shame, humiliation and anger.” Mr. Alam said it was common knowledge that many pilots were not following standard operating procedures and rules at Pakistan International and other domestic airlines. “Even the most qualified pilots don’t follow the S.O.P.s,” he said. “But the general public has come to know about this because it sadly ended in a crash,” referring to the accident in May. “It is a miracle that we don’t have more crashes.” He blamed it on a “deep-rooted societal issue, where the elites and powerful” have “full conviction that the can get away with anything and that all these rules are for someone else to abide by.” As an example, Mr. Alam cited the rule that when an aircraft descends below 10,000 feet, a “sterile flight deck” is required, meaning there should not be any exchange of information or discussion between crew members and with controllers other than that related to the landing profile. “Do you think any Pakistani pilot abides by this?” he asked. The pilots in the May 22 crash were discussing the coronavirus during the approach, the investigation found. The inquiry into the crash and pilot credentials has become politically charged. Opposition politicians and critics of Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government handled the post-crash situation in a tactless manner that has embarrassed Pakistan. “The government has sunk to new depths in order to shift blame from their own incompetence,” said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party. “They are exploiting a tragedy, engaging in victim-blaming, and their sheer incompetence has resulted in restrictions on Pakistani airlines and passengers.”  “Pakistani pilots — as with other pilots around the world — require regular license renewals after every six months, which includes flight simulations and other tests,” he said in faulting the government for blaming the pilots. “The government claims are most likely untrue, which the minister of aviation should never have said so publicly.”   “His statement has caused an international embarrassment and has put hundreds of careers at risk,” he added in calling for the aviation minister to resign.

"Days After a Wedding, a Dead Groom and Dozens of Coronavirus Cases",2020-07-02,By Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — The groom felt ill at the wedding. Days later, he was dead, and soon more than 100 guests had tested positive for the coronavirus. Now, Indian officials have opened an investigation into the wedding gathering, which some experts are calling a superspreader event. The event was in mid-June, and was attended by more than 300 guests in the city of Patna, in the northeastern state of Bihar, according to relatives who were there. The groom, a software engineer living near New Delhi, had returned to his home state to prepare for the ceremony, telling friends it would be “remembered forever” as a “corona marriage.” But a few days before the ceremony,  the groom started to vomit and complained of a headache, according to a relative who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared being ostracized.  The relative said the groom’s family took him to a hospital in Patna, but that his parents insisted on continuing with the wedding. He was not tested for the coronavirus, according to the relative. But a few days after the ceremony ended, Sri Kumar Ravi, the district magistrate in Patna, said he received an anonymous call: The groom had died, possibly from Covid-19, and his parents had cremated the body. Through an intermediary, the groom’s parents declined to comment. The Wire, an Indian news outlet, quoted the groom’s father as denying that his son had been sick before the wedding. But he said members of his family, including him, had recently tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Ravi said the bride, whose identity has not been disclosed, tested negative. But he said that more than 100 other guests have tested positive. He likened the wedding to “forcing your guests into mass suicide,” noting that there was evidence to suggest the groom knew he was sick before the ceremony but proceeded anyway without informing most people who attended. No charges have been filed yet, he said. India has struggled to limit the coronavirus, with more than half a million confirmed infections and around 18,000 deaths as of Thursday. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in late March, businesses shut and millions of Indians traveled from cities back to their villages. Many of those who returned home unknowingly spread the coronavirus to the countryside, leading to fresh outbreaks in states like Bihar that were initially spared high case loads.

"Russia Denies Paying Bounties, but Some Say the U.S. Had It Coming",2020-07-03,By Andrew Higgins and Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Three years into a grinding war in eastern Ukraine, the Trump administration, in a sharp break with Obama-era policy, proposed providing the Ukrainian army with potent American weapons, Javelin anti-tank missiles, to aid its struggle with Russian-backed separatists. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia responded with an ominous warning, saying weapons in the separatist regions could easily be sent “to other zones of conflict” — which many took to mean Afghanistan. Russia’s grievances against what it sees as American bullying and expansion into its own zones of influence have been stacking up for decades, starting with the C.I.A.’s role in arming mujahedin fighters who, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, delivered a fatal blow not only to the invading Red Army but the entire Soviet Union. A deep well of bitterness created by past and current conflicts in Afghanistan, Ukraine and more recently Syria, where U.S. forces killed scores of Russian mercenaries in 2018, help explain why Russia, according to U.S. intelligence officials, has become so closely entangled with the Taliban. In Ukraine, the Trump administration did send Javelins but with the stipulation that they not be used in the war. Russian officials and commentators reacted with fury to a report last week in The New York Times that American intelligence officials had concluded that Russia’s military intelligence agency had gone so far as to pay bounties to the Taliban and criminal elements linked to it to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. Intercepted electronic data showed large financial transfers from Russia’s military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U., to a Taliban-linked account, according to American officials. Officials also identified an Afghan contractor as a key middleman between the G.R.U. and militants linked to the Taliban who carried out the attacks. Russian officials have scoffed at the idea they would hire killers from a radical Islamist group that is banned in Russia as a “terrorist” outfit and that shares many views of the Afghan fighters who killed so many Red Army soldiers, and those of Islamic militants who caused Moscow so much pain in Chechnya during two wars there. In remarks to a state news agency on Monday, Zamir Kabulov, Mr. Putin’s special envoy for Afghanistan and a former ambassador in Kabul, dismissed the Taliban bounties report as “outright lies” generated by “forces in the United States who don’t want to leave Afghanistan and want to justify their own failures.” Amid a torrent of outraged denials, however, there have been pointed reminders that, in Russia’s view, the United States, because of its overreach overseas, deserves to taste some of its own medicine. Speaking during a talk show on state television dominated by conspiracy theories about plots by President Trump’s Democratic rivals, Aleksei Zhuravlyov, a member of the Russian Parliament, reminded viewers that as far as Russia was concerned, the United States has long had it coming. Recalling Operation Cyclone, the C.I.A.’s secret program to arm Moscow’s enemies in Afghanistan during the 1980s, Mr. Zhuravlyov said the United States had spent billions of dollars on weapons that“killed thousands and thousands” of Russians. “This is a medical fact.” While dismissing reports of Russian bounties for American scalps as “fake news,” he said, “Let’s suppose we paid” the Taliban, and then asked how many Americans had perhaps been killed as a result. “At most 22,” he responded. There is no evidence to date that Mr. Putin signed off on any program to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even independent experts say they strongly doubt he would have done so. Yet, Russia under Mr. Putin has for years throbbed with real and imagined pain from hurt inflicted by the United States, notably the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a desire to make it pay. Andrei Serenko, an expert at the Center for the Study of Contemporary Afghanistan in Moscow, said Russia has no real desire to see the United States leave Afghanistan and revels in America’s agonies from an endless conflict he described as a “sore blister for the United States.” All the same, he said, Russia has been preparing for an eventual pullout by cultivating ties to the Taliban as well as to various Afghan warlords. It has done this with money and other inducements in the hope of shaping future Afghan events and securing a useful instrument to poke Washington. The Taliban, like many other Afghan groups, he added, has a long record of running protection rackets and taking cash from foreigners, including Russians, Americans and Chinese. “This is what they do,” he said. “They are Afghanistan’s most successful business.” Russia, he said, “decided that if we can create lots of problems for Americans in Afghanistan, they will create fewer problems for us in Ukraine and Syria.” Moscow has been reaching out to the Taliban for years, starting in 1995 when Mr. Kabulov traveled to Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold in the south, to negotiate the release of Russian pilots who had been taken hostage. The pilots eventually got away with their aircraft in what was described at the time as a daring escape. But what really happened is unclear. One thing that seems certain, however, is that this first Russian negotiation with the Taliban revolved around money. “Everything was based on money,” Vasily Kravtsov, a former K.G.B. officer during the Soviet war and until 2018 a Russian diplomat in Kabul, recalled of the hostage talks. Mr. Kravtsov denied that Russia had since paid the Taliban bounties for the deaths of coalition soldiers, even as he recalled that Soviet soldiers had been killed in large numbers by American arms supplied to the mujahedin. He said he himself had been wounded twice by weapons “bought with American funds.” Igor Yerin, who fought in Afghanistan as a young Red Army conscript in the 1980s, said he never saw any Americans on the battlefield but “they were everywhere because of their Stingers.” Stingers were antiaircraft missiles provided to mujahedin fighters by the United States as part of a covert C.I.A. program. They enabled the mujahedin to shoot down hundreds of Soviet planes and helicopters, turning the tide in the decade-long war. Now the curator of a small museum in Moscow commemorating the inglorious Afghan war, Mr. Yerin showed off a display of land mines and other weapons sent to kill Russians as part of the C.I.A. program. Mr. Putin has for years played on this and other sources of Russian pain. Soon after coming to power two decades ago, he pledged support for former President George W. Bush in his “with or against us” war on terrorism in 2001, and cooperated with America’s drive to oust the Taliban. But he quickly soured on the idea that Washington could be a reliable partner and began blaming it for most of the world’s problems. Bristling with wounded pride, Mr. Putin in a fiery speech in Munich in 2007 denounced what he said was a “world of one master, one sovereign” and complained that the “United States has overstepped its national borders, in every area.” He has been settling scores ever since, often with help from the G.R.U., which even before Mr. Putin took power had won its spurs putting the United States in its place. Since he took office, the military intelligence agency has been accused of involvement in widespread mischief-making, from a bungled 2016 coup attempt in Montenegro aimed at preventing the Balkan nation’s entry into NATO, to meddling the same year in the U.S. presidential election. In a rare recent interview, the former head of the G.R.U., Valentin Korabelnikov, told state television how his officers had in 1999 organized a frantic dash by Russian troops and armor to Kosovo to occupy the airport in the capital, Pristina — just hours before the arrival of NATO forces. The stunt, he said, was “about the prestige of our state” and showing that Russia could not be ignored. Speaking in his former office at the headquarters of the G.R.U. in Moscow, Mr. Korabelnikov said that his agency had organized many other secret operations but that those could not be revealed. “The vast majority of operations carried out both by us and our brothers,” he said, referring to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service and the Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B. and headed in the late 1990s by Mr. Putin, “are completely closed, and only the small tip of the iceberg sometimes appears.” Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia’s security apparatus who wrote a doctorate on Moscow’s disastrous Afghan war, said “some old war horses” in the G.R.U. could have hatched a scheme to kill Americans as payback for Russians killed with American weapons in Afghanistan. But he said he doubted that such a plan would have been approved by the Russian leadership or executed without approval as a “maverick operation.” Even Mr. Yerin, the former conscript — who lost friends in Afghanistan — recalled that during his tour there, spent mostly near the northern city of Kunduz, he never believed political commissars in his unit who explained the 1979 Soviet invasion was necessary to keep the United States from moving into Russia’s back yard. “Today, I believe them,” Mr. Yerin said. “Afghanistan is our next-door neighbor,” he said, stabbing with his finger the southern border of the former Soviet Union on a big wall map, “What happens here is our business, not the Americans’.” Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.']",Russia’s grievances against what it sees as American bullying and expansion into its own zones of influence have been stacking up for decades.
"Daily Coronavirus Cases in the U.S. Soar Past 50,000 for the First Time",2020-07-02,,"['This briefing has ended. Read live coronavirus updates here. More than 55,000 new coronavirus infections were reported across the United States on Thursday, according to a New York Times database, as the country set a new daily case record for the sixth time in nine days. The alarming new milestone came as some of the country’s most populous states reported major surges, and as public health officials scrambled to limit the damage. At least eight states reported single-day case records on Thursday: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Tennessee. Thursday’s reported infection total represented an increase of more than 85 percent in daily cases since two weeks ago, when states were reopening after extensive lockdowns eased the outbreak, particularly in the hard-hit Northeast. Until last week, the country had not surpassed a record daily total for two months, since 36,738 new cases were reported on April 24. Now the surge in cases has shifted to the South and the West, as the nation staggers toward a holiday weekend burdened by a pandemic that threatens to keep growing worse. On Tuesday, as the outbreak expanded, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the country’s leading expert on infectious diseases, warned that new infections could rise to 100,000 a day as the outbreak resumed its march. On June 1, Florida officials announced 667 new cases. On July 1, they added more than 6,500. On Thursday, they reported over 10,100, a record. In California, where some newly reopened businesses were again being shut down, new case reports went from about 2,500 to more than 8,200 on Thursday, for the state’s highest single-day total. If June was the month when the pandemic spiraled from America’s grasp, July seems destined to be month when the country will learn just how bad it will get. Although Trump administration officials have argued in recent weeks that the rise in cases can be attributed to increased testing, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the assistant secretary of health who is overseeing the government’s testing response, told Congress on Thursday that the higher numbers in fact reflect an increase in cases. “There is no question that the more testing you get the more you will uncover, but we do believe this is a real increase in cases because the percent positivities are going up,” Admiral Giroir said. “So this is real increases in cases.” Ohio, Kansas and Louisiana, all of which looked stable not long ago, posted some of their highest single-day totals in weeks.  Though single-day snapshots are an imperfect measure of the pandemic, the broader picture is also exceedingly bleak. Case numbers were trending upward in 38 states as of Wednesday. The problem spots in the country’s South and West were spreading north and east, and hospitalizations surged in some states. Vice President Mike Pence changed his travel plans in Arizona after Secret Service agents set to accompany with him tested positive for the coronavirus or showed symptoms, two administration officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according to a person familiar with Mr. Pence’s travel. A swift rise in new cases in the state has overwhelmed testing centers in recent days, and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, ordered bars, gyms and movie theaters closed this week. In an apparent acknowledgment of outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the vice president canceled his plan to headline a “Faith in America” campaign rally in Tucson on Tuesday and then tour Yuma with Mr. Ducey. Instead, Mr. Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor International Airport. “Help is on the way,” Mr. Pence said at a news conference with Mr. Ducey at the airport, after descending the steps of Air Force Two wearing a mask, the latest sign of the administration’s evolving stance on face coverings. But the positive tests and symptoms of Secret Service agents expected to be in proximity to the man who is second in line for the presidency were some of the factors that prompted his change of schedule, the officials said. The news of the agents who showed symptoms of Covid-19, or tested positive, was first reported by The Washington Post. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not respond to a request for comment. The latest illnesses among the small circle of individuals who interact directly with the vice president were a reminder of the dangers of carrying on with campaign and official government travel as the pandemic rages on. China appears to be downplaying expectations ahead of a planned trip next week by a World Health Organization team to the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. Since the head of the World Health Organization announced the trip on Monday, several Chinese officials and experts have weighed in, saying that any investigation into the origins of the virus should not only focus on China. “It does not matter which country the scientific identification work starts with, as long as it involves all related countries and is fairly conducted,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run nationalist newspaper Global Times on Tuesday. Wang Guangfa, a top government health adviser, told Global Times this week that the World Health Organization should also go to Spain. He cited a not-yet-published study by researchers at the University of Barcelona that suggests the new coronavirus was present in Spain’s wastewater as early as March 2019. Independent experts have said the study was flawed, and that other lines of evidence strongly suggest the virus emerged in China late last year. The virus most likely originated in bats, but the path of transmission is still unknown. Experts say establishing that will be a crucial step in preventing future outbreaks. The hunt for information has focused on Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus is believed to have first emerged, and specifically the Huanan Seafood Market, which was said to have sold wildlife and had links to many of the country’s first reported cases. Mike Ryan, head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program, said on Wednesday that the agency would be sending two experts from Geneva to join its China country team on next week’s trip. He said one would likely be an epidemiologist and the other an expert in animal health. Dr. Ryan did not reveal which cities the team were planning to visit. He described it as a “scoping mission.” Getting answers on the origins of the virus has become more difficult as the issue has become increasingly politicized. China has been on the defensive for months in response to growing criticism from the United States and other countries for its initial mishandling of the outbreak. Officials from both the United States and China have, without providing evidence, accused one another of intentionally releasing the virus. But at a regular press briefing this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman sounded a less-aggressive note. “China has always believed that virus tracing is a scientific issue, and relevant research should be carried out by scientists and medical experts,” said Zhao Lijian, the spokesman, who in March promoted a theory that the U.S. Army purposely introduced the virus to China. “China continues to support scientists from all over the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and spread of viruses,” he added. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas issued a sweeping order on Thursday requiring most Texans to wear masks in public, in an abrupt reversal as cases soar in the nation’s second-largest state. The order applies to Texas counties with 20 or more coronavirus cases. The order represents a stark change for Mr. Abbott, a Republican, who earlier opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. But as cases surged in recent weeks, he cleared the way for local authorities to require masks in businesses, before imposing the more aggressive statewide requirement on Thursday. “We have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheck,” Mr. Abbott said in a statement. “But it requires each of us to do our part to protect one another — and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces. \u200b” On Wednesday, Texas reported a record of more \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthan 8,000 new cases, then about 7,300 on Thursday. The outbreak there, and in other states across the South and West, has fueled record numbers of new cases in the United States. The nation reported nearly 50,000 new cases on Wednesday, a record. And at least six states reported single-day case records on Thursday: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Tennessee. Mr. Abbott’s order has limited exceptions for young children, people with medical conditions and people eating in restaurants or exercising outdoors. Mr. Abbott had previously cast his opposition to mask mandates as a matter of principle. Last month, in an interview with KWTX-TV, Mr. Abbott said that while businesses could be ordered to require masks, “we want to make sure individual liberty is not infringed upon by government, and hence government cannot require individuals to wear masks.” The governor also said that with limited exceptions Texans cannot gather in groups larger than 10 people and must maintain six feet of social distance from one another. Even the aging rapper Vanilla Ice has yielded to pleas from local health officials, backing off a planned July 4 concert at Lake Travis in Texas. He said on Thursday that he “didn’t know the numbers were so crazy.” Gov. Abbott’s decision was the latest sign that Republicans are embracing masks, as the virus spreads in a number of Republican-led states in the South and the West. Vice President Mike Pence pointedly wore a mask at a church visit in Dallas on Sunday. Even President Trump, who has resisted wearing a mask in public, said this week, “I’m all for masks,” while still declining to wear them. By a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court on Thursday blocked a trial judge’s order that would have made it easier for voters in three Alabama counties to use absentee ballots in this month’s primary runoff election. In March, Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, postponed the election because of the pandemic. At the same time, the Republican official who oversees the state’s elections, John H. Merrill, Alabama’s secretary of state, expanded the availability of absentee ballots to all voters who concluded that it was “impossible or unreasonable to vote at their voting place.” But Mr. Merrill did not relax two of the usual requirements for absentee voting: submission of a copy of a photo ID with a voter’s application for a ballot and submission of an affidavit signed by a notary public, or two adult witnesses, with the ballot itself. Four voters and several groups sued to challenge those restrictions, saying that, in light of the health crisis, they placed an unlawful burden on the right to vote. Making a copy of a piece of identification, for instance, may be difficult and dangerous during the pandemic, they said. Officials in Alabama, which has more than 40,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 1,000 deaths, have dismissed that concern. In asking the Supreme Court to intervene, state officials said an order by an Alabama judge — which, among other things, blocked election officials in two counties from enforcing the ID requirement for voters who are disabled or 65 or older — had come too close to the election and threatened its integrity. In their brief, the state officials discussed ways in which voters could safely comply with the witness requirement. In response, lawyers for the voters said the state had offered no good reasons “to justify the application of the witness or photo ID requirements to high-risk voters in the middle of a pandemic.” As President Trump heads to Mount Rushmore on Friday to spend the Independence Day holiday in the carved presence of presidential greatness, he is suffering through the most trying stretch of his administration thanks in large part to his self-inflicted wounds. Last month’s convergence of crises, and the president’s missteps in responding to them, have been well-chronicled: his inflammatory response to racial justice protesters and his ill-considered rally in Tulsa, his refusal to acknowledge the resurgent virus or seriously address detailed reports about Russian operatives’ putting a cash bounty on American soldiers. It’s this kind of behavior, polls indicate, that has alienated swaths of swing voters. The disconnect between the surge in coronavirus cases and Mr. Trump’s dismissive stance toward the pandemic has been particularly pronounced, mystifying Democrats and Republicans alike; this week, as some states halted their reopening because of a record-setting number of new cases, the president predicted the virus would “just disappear.” What mystifies many Republicans about Mr. Trump is why he is so unwilling to take easy steps that could help remedy his political difficulties. The most visible example is Mr. Trump’s refusal to promote mask-wearing to fight the virus, which poses perhaps the most dire threat to his re-election. Mr. Trump continues to hope for an economic recovery he can run on in the final four months of the campaign, and on Thursday he trumpeted as a sign of progress the employment report showing 4.8 million jobs gained in June. But it is not clear that Mr. Trump will get much credit for a partial — and possibly fleeting — rebound when coronavirus cases are soaring. Global roundup Long before Venice became a hot spot for international travelers, locals would practice the tradition of flânerie, an aimless stroll through the city’s calli, or walkways. Now flânerie is back: The pandemic has crushed the tourism industry, and many residents have more time and space to enjoy the city’s slow pace and faded beauty, even if money is tight. Venice is one of several European cities that rely heavily on tourism and was particularly vulnerable to pandemic’s economic side effects. Some economists have even described it as a “tourism monoculture,” borrowing the term from the risky agricultural practice of growing a single crop. Some residents and officials now hope that city’s economy can begin to move away from that monoculture — for example, by drawing in international investors and expanding the footprint of its two universities. “We have to act now, before mass tourism will be back at full capacity, because we won’t get a second chance,” said Paolo Costa, an economics professor and former mayor of Venice. Officials in Tokyo, Japan, said on Friday that the number of new cases had topped 100 for a second straight day, according to the national broadcaster NHK. The spike came nearly six weeks after the Japanese capital lifted a state of emergency and declared the virus contained. In recent weeks, Brazil has emerged as one of the world’s most severe hot spots, second only to the United States. With Brazil’s caseload ballooning, Ernesto Londoño, the Brazil bureau chief for The New York Times, explains what went wrong. The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged European Union countries to step up testing and contact tracing, and asked governments to communicate to their citizens that “the pandemic is not over.” The warning comes as Europe’s reopening has brought a resurgence of cases in some pockets. Officials in Britain failed to heed early warnings that domestic abuse would soar during the lockdown. For some victims trapped with their abusers, the consequences have been catastrophic. As the number of coronavirus infections soars in some countries, the mortality rate has not kept pace, and some believe the growing number of young people on the case list may account for that disparity. But the chief scientist of the World Health Organization noted Thursday that young people are vulnerable to severe complications from the virus. Days after a wedding in India, the groom died, and at least 100 guests tested positive for the virus. Indian officials have opened an investigation into the mid-June gathering, which some experts are calling a superspreader event, attended by more than 300 guests in the city of Patna, in the northeastern state of Bihar. There is a growing recognition across party lines that Congress will need to spend more money, soon, to continue to prop up the American economy. But there is little consensus on what the next aid package should look like and how quickly it will arrive. Some economists say lawmakers are risking further damage to an already fragile recovery by not moving more quickly. Real-time indicators of shopping patterns and business openings suggest that a once-brisk economic rebound stalled in June as the virus began spreading more rapidly in Texas, Florida and other states. And even the most encouraging signs of recovery — such as the jobs report released today, which said U.S. payrolls grew by 4.8 million in June — underscore how far the recovery still has to get back to what was normal before the virus: Nearly 18 million Americans remain unemployed. Lobbyists and lawmakers say the Trump administration, which has lost several economic advisers in recent weeks, is not deeply engaged in devising another rescue package. Officials have hinted for weeks that they would formally propose tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other initiatives, but they have not followed through. Mr. Trump has expressed support for additional tax cuts and government spending. Senators are expected to leave Washington on Thursday after making only incremental progress toward an agreement to extend further relief to businesses and laid-off workers who are about to lose or have already exhausted federal assistance. “The stimulus was very short-lived,” said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at the investment bank Jefferies. “This problem is going to persist long beyond July.” As the virus has exploded in large swaths of the nation over the past two weeks, only a dozen states, mostly in the Northeast, have managed to keep new case levels flat or declining. New York, which averaged 9,877 cases per day when it reached the height of its outbreak in April, has been staying mostly flat at an average of 620 cases per day. Other states in the Northeast that were initially hit hard, including New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are all plateauing at far lower levels than earlier in the pandemic. Massachusetts announced Thursday that it would move forward with the next phase of its reopening on Monday for all areas of the state except for Boston. Movie theaters, outdoor performance venues, fitness centers, museums and other businesses will be allowed to resume operations. Up to 25 people will be allowed to gather in indoor spaces, provided that they are adequately spaced. Boston is scheduled to ease its restrictions in those areas on July 13. “Today the public health data makes clear that Massachusetts is effectively bringing the fight to the virus as we’ve reopened,” Gov. Charlie Baker said at a news conference Thursday. Other states where new cases have stayed largely the same over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database, include Vermont, Maryland, Virginia, Indiana, Nebraska and South Dakota. The state showing the biggest decline in new cases over the past two weeks, according to the database, was New Hampshire. Its decline has been modest: It is now averaging 29 new cases a day, down from over 34 cases a day two weeks ago. But its governor, Christopher T. Sununu, said that the state should not expect its declines to last. “I actually think a spike in Covid cases will happen in New Hampshire, and that is the real tough situation that we have,” he said Wednesday on WMUR. “It would be very ignorant and arrogant of us to think that we are going to be completely immune to what’s happening in other parts of the country.” “The reason the spikes are happening in other parts of the country aren’t just because they’re reopening,” he said, adding that many people in other areas, and particularly young people, were not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. “Unfortunately I think we are going to see some outbreaks here,” he said. “The key is here we can manage it this time: We have P.P.E., we have testing capabilities, we have more financial resources.” Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that New York City schools would open in some form come September — only for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office to describe the mayor’s announcement as “premature.” “We value the opinion of local politicians and the state’s 700 local school districts as to what should be done, but the public should not be confused on this important decision that has practical consequences for many,” Dani Lever, Mr. Cuomo’s spokeswoman, in a statement. The lack of coherent communication from the state and the city about the nation’s largest school system sowed further confusion among public school parents eager for clarity about the coming school year. Some private schools are also are likely to follow the public school path. It is not the first time the two officials have differed on schools. In April, when Mr. de Blasio announced that they would remain closed for the rest of the school year, Mr. Cuomo discounted it as merely the mayor’s “opinion.” For months, Mr. de Blasio has suggested that schools would reopen in some form in September, On Thursday, he offered slightly more clarity. The mayor said that students and teachers would be required to wear masks, that schools would get daily deep cleanings, and that each school would welcome the maximum daily number of students possible, given social distancing and other health requirements. He cited a recent survey of public school parents finding that 75 percent of them want their children to return to class this year. The survey got 400,000 responses. On Thursday, the schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, met with principals to discuss plans for reopening. The schools will be able to reopen only with buy-in from unionized teachers and staff members. The teachers union president, Michael Mulgrew, said he anticipated the city would release its models for “blended” virtual and in-person learning next week. “Our final decision about moving ahead in September depends upon medical and scientific assessments concerning the virus and its containment,” Mr. Mulgrew wrote in a Thursday email to members. “The changing nature of these assessments means we must wait to make that decision closer to the first day of school even though we know that delay creates difficulties for parents and educators alike.” The British government failed to heed early warnings that domestic abuse would soar during the lockdown. Now, more than four months later, it is still lagging in its response. For some victims trapped with their abusers, the consequences have been catastrophic. In the first month after the lockdown began in late March, 16 women and girls were killed in suspected domestic homicides — more than triple the number in the same period in 2019. At least 10 more have died in the two months since then. Distress calls to abuse hotlines are soaring, charities are overwhelmed and some emergency housing providers cannot meet demand. The courts offer limited help, at best. Overwhelmed by lengthy delays, they have allowed some accused of abuse to return home, despite restraining orders. Other countries have fared better. New Zealand included domestic abuse preparations in its lockdown planning from the start. Italy, Spain and other countries set up nationwide programs to house abuse victims in hotels if existing shelters were full. Germany made an open-ended pledge to fund shelters and other services. Britain did none of this. Interviews with more than 50 government and law enforcement officials, academic experts, front-line support workers and abuse survivors show that British leaders never prioritized domestic abuse in lockdown planning and are still failing to quickly provide help. “There is no defined government strategy at all,” said Jess Phillips, a Labour lawmaker who speaks for the opposition on domestic violence policy. “Some services have got no funding to keep going.” The government contests that. Victoria Atkins, the minister in charge of the government’s response to domestic violence, said in a statement that the authorities were “committed to supporting victims and bringing perpetrators to account.” U.S. roundup As Florida reported on Thursday more than 10,100 new cases, breaking another single-day record, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez said that he was imposing a countywide curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., starting Friday and until further notice. “This is one of various actions I’m pursuing to tamp down this spike of Covid-19 and protect our residents,” he said in a statement. He is also rolling back the opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their plans approved by the county. “People going to restaurants will also have to keep their masks on while seated at their table — removing the mask only to eat and drink,” he said. Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the busy Fourth of July weekend. Florida reported Thursday that an 11-year-old boy in Miami-Dade County had died, the youngest death attributed to Covid-19 in the state. Case numbers had been lower earlier in the week, but that may have been because fewer test results were being reported each day. Nearly 69,000 results were reported on Thursday, compared with about 45,000 on Wednesday. Vice President Mike Pence visited the state Thursday and met with Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss the state’s rapidly worsening outbreak. The visit was quite different in tone from one in May, when the two men ate, unmasked, at a burger bar and Mr. Pence praised the state’s reopening plans, saying, “I really think Florida has set the pace.” Back then Mr. DeSantis proclaimed “we’ve succeeded,” and added, “I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative.” On Thursday, both men wore masks, but removed them to speak at a news conference, and Mr. Pence said that the federal government would work with the state to help flatten its curve. “The economic comeback that is underway is a demonstration that we don’t have to choose between opening up America and the health of our people: We can do both,” he said. “And that’s the challenge that we face today across the Sun Belt.” Contact tracers, unable to keep up with so many new cases, have become overwhelmed by the surge. “We are starting to lose the ability to do contact tracing,” said Dr. J. Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida. City and county officials desperate to stop the spread have adopted local mask mandates and closed the beaches over the holiday weekend. Some communities are deploying teams of public employees to go door-to-door in the hardest hit neighborhoods, distributing masks, hand sanitizers and fliers with information on symptoms and testing. Testing demand has remained high: In Miami-Dade County, which has averaged more than 1,400 daily cases, the biggest testing sites begin taking appointments at 9 a.m. for the next day and have filled them by 9:30 a.m., county officials said. “The requests for testing have exploded,” said Maurice Kemp, county deputy mayor. Elsewhere in the United States: When South Carolina’s coronavirus case counts started to rise sharply in June, the Citadel, one of the few state-supported military colleges in the country, rolled out an elaborate plan for the football team to work out safely over the summer. But 13 players tested positive anyway, cutting the team’s training short. They were exposed by attending an off-campus party, or by living with someone who had, according to Col. Colonel John Dorrian, the college’s vice president for communications and marketing. N.F.L. team owners and the players’ union, mindful of other professional leagues’ struggles to return to play, are considering playing the 2020 regular season with few or no fans in attendance. They are also discussing how to absorb lost revenue potentially worth billions, according to three people briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss the matter publicly. Five of the nine Atlantic City casinos were reopening Thursday but with new rules: Gamblers must wear masks, and won’t be allowed to smoke, drink or eat inside. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that the vast majority of families have indicated that they want to send their children back to school in September, according to a survey of roughly 450,000 families. The city is still working on plans to safely maximize the number of students in schools, he said, adding that schools could shift to a staggered schedule. The governor has said logistics are up to individual districts. Also in New York City, 22 streets, some already closed to car traffic, will be dedicated to outdoor dining on Friday nights and weekends. The move will be key in “some places in the city where we have extraordinary restaurants concentrated in one place,” the mayor said. Officials rushing to contain a virus cluster tied to a party in a New York City suburb used an unusual legal strategy: issuing subpoenas to partygoers. Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate, announced Thursday that he had been hospitalized with the virus. Mr. Cain, who attended Mr. Trump’s indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20, learned Monday that he had tested positive, was hospitalized Wednesday and on Thursday “was resting comfortably in an Atlanta-area hospital,” according to a statement posted on his Twitter account. Noting what was probably his last chance to reach residents before the July 4 holiday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday implored residents to refrain from gathering with people outside their household — no matter how great the temptation — and to wear masks. “The evidence is simply overwhelming,” he said in a video news conference. “Masks keep Californians healthy.” Mr. Newsom unveiled a new public awareness campaign about the importance of wearing masks, having already ordered people to wear them in most indoor — and some outdoor — public settings. But amid rising case counts and hospitalizations, the governor was peppered with questions about how the state will actually enforce newly announced restrictions across counties where local leaders have shown varied willingness to comply with state-issued directives. That particularly applied to 19 counties, home to almost three quarters of the state’s population, where the spread of the virus has been the most disturbing. “We are working with counties in the spirit of partnership,” Mr. Newsom said. “But if we don’t see the level of local action that we are hoping for, with all 19 coming into compliance, that hand will be forced.” On Wednesday, he announced that he was establishing teams to work with local authorities. The governor has emphasized that $2.5 billion in pandemic aid will be reserved for counties that do their share of enforcement. Nevertheless, he said, “it requires some level of personal responsibility.” “The most important thing we’ve learned over the past couple of months is that we should focus on how, not when, to safely reopen,” Mr. Newsom said. The state on Thursday reported thousands of new cases, he said. Over the past two weeks, he said, the rate of positive tests had increased to 6.3 percent, as hospitalizations increased by 56 percent and intensive care cases rose by 49 percent. While thousands of Britons wait for their government to loosen curbs on summer foreign travel, one person has gone abroad anyway: Stanley Johnson, father of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson, 79, posted pictures on social media of his arrival in Greece, a country that currently does not allow entry to travelers flying directly from Britain, which has the world’s fifth-highest number of virus cases, according to a Times database. The trip, apparently made via Bulgaria, defies official British government guidance urging Britons not to go abroad unless they have to, and at a time when those returning to Britain must quarantine for 14 days. An announcement on the relaxation of those rules had been expected on Thursday but was delayed as the government struggled to finalize its plan to allow Britons to return from dozens of nations without quarantine. Speaking from Greece, Stanley Johnson told the Daily Mail newspaper that he had traveled to Greece via the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, and was abroad on “essential business trying to Covid-proof my property in view of the upcoming letting season.” It is not the first time Mr. Johnson has defied the official advice of his son or his government on how to control the outbreak. In March, when the prime minister urged Britons not to visit pubs before the lockdown took effect, Stanley Johnson said he would go anyway if he felt the need. For months, scientists have debated whether a variant of the virus that has come to predominate in much of the world did so partly because it is more transmissible than other viruses. On Thursday, a team of researchers reported new evidence suggesting that the variant did have such an advantage. The new paper, led by Bette Korber, a theoretical biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and posted by the journal Cell, presents evidence in the form of lab findings, tests of infected patients and a broad statistical analysis of the pandemic as the D614G variant took over in cities, regions and countries. “The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage,” the authors concluded. The underlying question is important for understanding the early phases of the pandemic and anticipating how it will progress in the coming months. If the genetic glitch that defines the variant imparted even a slight increase in transmissibility, it would help explain why infections exploded in some regions and not in others with similar density and other attributes. Skeptics argue that it is far more likely that the variation spread widely by chance, multiplying outward from explosive outbreaks in Europe. “This is an extraordinarily challenging problem,” said Dr. Marc Suchard, a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine. “The evolution and demography are complex. So there’s much more work to be done.” Nearly six weeks after Tokyo lifted a state of emergency and declared the virus contained in the Japanese capital, new cases spiked to 107 on Thursday, up from 67 just a day earlier and the highest level since May 2. Cases had been rising over the last week, with a high concentration detected in the city’s nightlife districts. In a news conference on Thursday, Yuriko Koike, the Tokyo governor, said that people in their 20s and 30s accounted for 70 percent of the cases and that many were asymptomatic. Ms. Koike said she would not ask businesses to close but encouraged the public to take precautions. Dr. Norio Ohmagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, said the average daily number of cases, whose route of infection could not be traced, had more than doubled in the last week. “It indicates the possibility that community transmission could be spreading,” he said. The Palestinian Authority announced plans to reimpose virus restrictions throughout the West Bank following a sharp rise in the number of new cases in the territory. Ibrahim Milhim, a spokesman for the authority, said during a Wednesday news conference that all areas of the West Bank would be locked down for five days beginning on Friday. All businesses will be closed with the exception of bakeries, supermarkets and pharmacies. A total of 2,908 people in the territory have contracted the virus since the beginning of March — and more than 2,200 of those cases came in the past two weeks alone, according to the health ministry of the Palestinian Authority. The number of virus-related deaths in the territory climbed from three to eight in the same period. More than 80 percent of the current cases are linked to the city of Hebron, which began to shut down on Wednesday evening. Mr. Milhim said that the five-day lockdown could be extended and called on Palestinians to follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks, warning that there would be consequences for those who did not comply. At least 80 students living in fraternity houses at the University of Washington have tested positive for the virus, the university confirmed on Thursday. The university set up a testing facility on Monday within walking distance of Greek Row in Seattle, and more than 800 people have been tested so far, said Michelle Ma, a university spokeswoman. By Tuesday, the school had confirmed that 38 students living in 10 fraternity houses had tested positive. The larger number comes from the Interfraternity Council, a student-run governing body, according to Erik Johnson, the president of the council. Mr. Johnson said that the 80 students from 12 houses self-reported their positive test results to the presidents of their chapter facilities. Many universities around the country are grappling with how to safely reopen, as dormitories and other communal spaces pose unique safety challenges. Public health experts also say that college-town bars, nightclubs and corner taverns are becoming dangerous new hot spots for the coronavirus, seeding infections in thousands of mostly young adults and adding to surging cases nationwide. At least 100 new cases have been linked to Harper’s Restaurant and Brew Pub, a popular spot in the college town East Lansing, Mich., since it reopened in June. “What is occurring north of campus provides lessons for students as they consider their return to campus this fall,” Dr. Geoffrey Gottlieb, the chair of the University of Washington’s Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases, said in a statement. “If everyone does their part to keep each other safe, we can continue to engage with one another and with our studies in the university environment by wearing face coverings and remaining physically distant.” More than 1,000 students live in 25 fraternity houses in the neighborhood north of the university’s Seattle campus. The school says it has asked infected students to self-isolate. As the number of infections soars in some countries, the mortality rate has not kept pace. Some believe that the increased number of young people getting infected may account for the disparity. But Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist of the World Health Organization, said on Thursday that young people are vulnerable to severe complications, especially if they are overweight. “We should not become complacent that it’s fine for young people to get infected,” Dr. Swaminathan said, “because there is a subset, particularly those with obesity, those with habits like smoking, for example, who are at higher risk of complications and death.” She also said that determining death rates in the midst of the pandemic is complicated by several factors. One is the lag time between the identification of a case and death. Fatalities from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, typically occur three to five weeks after patients are infected. But many countries divide the number of deaths by the number of infections. “It has been suggested by scientists that, really to get an accurate idea of case fatality rates, you should divide by the number of cases two weeks ago, not the number of cases today,” Dr. Swaminathan said. The death rate in the United States is about 5 percent. But according to recent data from the C.D.C., there are likely 10 times more infections than are reported. The so-called infection fatality rate — which includes all cases, not just identified cases — may be about 0.6 percent globally, Dr. Swaminathan said.

Myanmar Jade Mine Collapse Kills at Least 168,2020-07-02,By Saw Nang and Richard C. Paddock,"['MANDALAY, Myanmar — With barely enough time to yell “run,” hundreds of jade miners had only moments to escape their killer: a giant wave of mud and water, more than 20 feet high, propelled out of a vast pit mine swollen with rainwater. Weeks of heavy rains, carried by the seasonal monsoon, had filled the Wai Khar jade mine in northern Myanmar and turned it into a lake. Towering over the pit was a 1,000-foot hillside topped with a mound of mining waste, its foundations weakening with every drop of rain. Just after sunrise on Thursday the earth began to shift and a wall of mud cascaded down the mound’s steep slope, slamming into the flooded mine and sending a huge wave of water along its walls as rushing green water swept from one end of the lake to the other. “When the open-pit mine collapsed, the workers didn’t have time to run away,” said U Tin Soe, the region’s representative in Parliament. “The height of the wave was about 20 feet and it drowned many people. It was like a tsunami.” Hundreds of miners who were digging for jade illegally near the water’s edge were quickly overwhelmed by the muddy green wave. Some managed to run to higher ground. But many were not so lucky. By Friday morning, officials said 168 bodies had been recovered and 54 people had been injured, and officials expected the death toll to surpass 200. Officials said there was little left for rescuers to do but retrieve bodies that floated to the surface. The disaster occurred after a heavy rainstorm in Hpakant township in Kachin State, where miners labor in notoriously hazardous conditions to produce jade worth billions of dollars. The government ordered the mines in the region to close from July 1 to Sept. 30 because of the risk of landslides during the heavy rains of the monsoon season, officials said. But at the Wai Khar mine, hundreds of illegal workers came in to take the place of the regular miners despite the risk, said Mr. Tin Soe. “The government ordered them to stop because it is dangerous to work here in the rainy season,” he said by phone from the scene of the disaster. “But after the mining companies stopped, an illegal ethnic armed group took money from the illegal miners and gave them permission to work here.” Kachin is Myanmar’s northernmost state and borders China and India. Rich in natural resources, Kachin has been racked by fighting between the military and ethnic rebels, but the lucrative jade mining area has largely remained under government control. Despite attempts to regulate the industry, much of the mining there is done illegally by wildcat miners. Much of the wealth generated by the jade industry is controlled by Myanmar’s military, which long ruled the country and retains vast authority under the Constitution it drafted. But the main rebel group in the region, the Kachin Independent Army, also finances its operations from the jade trade. It took over the mine when the consortium of five companies that operate it closed for the season on Tuesday. Mr. Tin Soe said that about 100,000 miners work in the region and it is impossible to stop them despite the risks. “If people continue working, there will surely be more landslides and death,” he said. “But there is no rule of law in this area. That’s why it’s difficult to control.” Mine collapses occur frequently in the jade mining region of Kachin State. More than 50 people died in a similar landslide last year, and dozens were swept away the year before. At least 120 were buried in 2015 after the collapse of a mound of mining waste known as tailings. U Kyaw Min, the administrator for the Wai Khar district said continuing rainfall was hampering the search-and-rescue effort. “We can’t go deeper to rescue, so we have to pick up the floating dead bodies,” he said. “It’s also difficult to send the patients to hospital because the roads are muddy because of the rain.” Saw Nang reported from Mandalay, Myanmar, and Richard C. Paddock from Bangkok. Hannah Beech contributed reporting from Bangkok.']","Dozens of miners were missing after a huge pile of muddy waste collapsed into an open pit in northern Myanmar, triggering a vast wave, an official said."
Turkey Convicts Human Rights Activists on Terror Charges,2020-07-03,By Megan Specia,"['A Turkish court on Friday convicted four human rights activists of terrorism charges, including two former leaders of Amnesty International, as part of a broader crackdown on opposition voices in the country. One defendant, Taner Kilic, who once led Amnesty Turkey, a top human rights watchdog, was convicted on charges of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to six years and three months in prison. Three others — Ozlem Dalkiran, Idil Eser and Gunal Kursun — were convicted of “assisting a terrorist organization” and each sentenced to 25 months in jail. Their cases are the latest in a widespread crackdown on dissent in Turkey in the wake of a failed 2016 coup attempt. The crackdown has seen hundreds put on trial and deepened political divisions within the country. While the government accused the group of terrorism, critics say the trials are part of an arbitrary system under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that has targeted human rights defenders with baseless accusations and used the justice system to close down civil society activism.  The prosecution maintained that those on trial are connected to Fethullah Gulen, a cleric accused of having organized the plot to overthrow Turkey’s government from his base in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen has denied any involvement and has accused Mr. Erdogan of orchestrating it as an excuse to seize more power. The four convicted on Friday spent three years fighting the charges. As no detention orders have yet been issued, they will not be imprisoned pending their appeals, and the appeals process could take years. Seven other defendants who were also on trial were acquitted on Friday. In a statement, Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s Turkey researcher, called the convictions a “travesty of justice of spectacular proportions.” “This verdict is a crushing blow not only for Taner, Ozlem, İdil and Gunal and their families but for everyone who believes in justice, and human rights activism in Turkey and beyond,” he said. Idil Eser, who was once the director of Amnesty’s Turkey office, was detained in 2017 in a raid on a digital security workshop in Istanbul alongside several other activists who ended up on trial. Mr. Kilic was arrested separately a month earlier in the city of Izmir and was held in prison for nearly a year and a half before being released late last year under court orders. A day before the sentencing, Ms. Eser called the trial politically motivated from the start and said it was intended to intimidate other activists. “These prosecutions aim to silence those in the dock and send a message to the rest of society: fight for human rights or speak the truth at your peril,” she said in a statement. Human rights experts say the convictions signaled an erosion of civil society in Turkey. Mary Lawlor, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights defenders, said in a statement that the evidence introduced to support the charges “has yet to clearly demonstrate how their activities amounted to terrorism.” “They should never have been prosecuted,” Ms. Lawlor wrote in a post on Twitter following the decision.']","The cases are part of a widespread effort to quash dissent in the country, which has seen dozens of activists put on trial after a failed 2016 coup attempt."
"England Drops Its Quarantine for Most Visitors, but Not Those From the U.S.",2020-07-03,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of America and delivering another rebuke to President Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The European Union recently upheld a ban on travelers from the United States, even as it opened its borders to visitors from Canada, Rwanda, Thailand and 15 other countries. England’s policy, announced on Friday, is not as draconian. Visitors from America can still enter the country so long as they agree to isolate themselves for two weeks. But those from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and dozens of other countries will be able to travel to England with no restrictions — an arrangement intended to bolster the languishing tourism industry in time for the summer vacation season. The regulations will take effect on July 10. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in easing restrictions. The United States has barred most visitors from Britain since March, after briefly exempting them from a travel ban on the European Union. At the time, Europe was dealing with far more coronavirus infections than the United States. Since then, the epicenter of the pandemic has moved across the Atlantic. During the initial phase of the outbreak, Britain stayed open to travel from viral hot spots like Italy, Spain and Iran. By the time it imposed the quarantine measures, its infection rates were among the highest in the world. That prompted fierce criticism of a policy that placed restrictions on people arriving from countries where the virus was well under control, including New Zealand. The authorities threatened to fine rule breakers up to £1,000 ($1,245). Critics said the measures were economically damaging, ineffective and legally unenforceable because the country did not have the resources to ensure that people were obeying their 14-day quarantine. Of the 12 police forces that replied to questions from the BBC, none said they had handed out any fines. Some public-health experts said the fractious debate over the quarantine had distracted from more pressing problems, like safely reopening Britain’s schools, organizing an effective test-and-trace program and organizing a system to stamp out new outbreaks in cities like Leicester to avert a second lockdown. “The U.K. government seems focused on giving people a summer pandemic holiday instead of dealing with the hard issues facing the aviation industry for the coming year,” said Professor Devi Sridhar, the director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. Scotland has balked at the easing, much as it resisted Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s earlier plans to lift the lockdown. Its infection and death rates are lower than in England, which officials attribute to its more cautious approach. The Scottish government has yet to decide how to relax restrictions on travelers, though its options are somewhat limited, given its open border with England. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the BBC on Friday that the United States would be excluded from the immediate relaxation because of the “very high numbers of infections” in the country. The government has designated countries with green, yellow and red lights, based on “the prevalence of coronavirus, the numbers of new cases and potential trajectory of the disease in that destination.” The United States has a red light. The announcement appeared to go further than an earlier idea floated by ministers to create “air bridges” with specific countries, in which travelers would have reciprocal freedom to travel. The government still hopes that a number of the exempted countries will not require visitors from Britain to quarantine. But the list of greenlight countries comprises more than 50\xa0— among them Vietnam and Hong Kong, though not mainland China. Some could still require travelers from Britain to quarantine on arrival. On the British end, many arriving passengers will still be required to provide contact information. Still, for the travel industry, it was a welcome relief after a tense period when they worried that the summer season was going to be ruined. Many complained about the damage to their businesses and warned about job losses. “It has been an incredibly frustrating time,” said Steven Freudmann, the chairman of the Institute of Travel and Tourism, a lobbying group. “There just appears to be no coordinated thinking. A shambles is the only word I can think of.” Mr. Freudmann said he was “happy and relieved that finally — finally — the government seems to be making sensible decisions.” But he said the government’s erratic policies had “created a lack of confidence and clearly we, as an industry, have a job in establishing that confidence.” Nor was Mr. Freudmann the only critic of the government’s decision-making over quarantine rules. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, described it as “shambolic,” adding that she wanted to study the detail before taking any decision on whether Scotland should adopt the new program with England. Among those who flouted the existing travel restrictions was the father of Mr. Johnson, Stanley Johnson. The elder Mr. Johnson, 79, posted pictures on social media of his arrival in Greece, which currently prevents vacationers from flying directly from Britain. He apparently got there via the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. It was not the first time he had defied government coronavirus advice. Before Britain’s lockdown began, when the prime minister urged Britons not to go to the pub, his father said he would go anyway if he felt the thirst. Speaking from Greece, Stanley Johnson told the Daily Mail newspaper that he was in the country on “essential business, trying to Covid-proof my property in view of the upcoming letting season.”']","In a bid to salvage the summer tourist season, travelers from France, Italy, Spain and dozens of other nations no longer have to isolate for 14 days after arriving."
Australia Thought the Virus Was Under Control. It Found a Vulnerable Spot.,2020-07-02,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['MELBOURNE, Australia — Ring Mayar spends all day knocking on doors in the western suburbs of Melbourne, asking residents if they have a cough, a fever or chills. Even if they do not, he encourages them to get tested for the coronavirus, as the authorities race to catch up with a string of outbreaks that is threatening to recast Australia’s success story in controlling the spread. “It’s quite daunting,” said Mr. Mayar, the president of the South Sudanese Community Association in the state of Victoria, who has been volunteering in one of the largely immigrant communities where cases are surging. The rise in infections — Victoria reported 77 new cases Thursday, the most since March — has driven home the outsized impact of the coronavirus on communities in which working-class immigrants and essential workers are particularly vulnerable to the disease. In these places, people often must venture out for jobs that put them at risk of contracting the virus, and communication by the authorities in residents’ native languages can be patchy. As it has elsewhere in the world, the coronavirus found a hole in Australia’s system: It spread in part because of the sharing of a cigarette lighter among security guards working at a hotel where returning international travelers are being quarantined. It later circulated in low-income neighborhoods in the Melbourne area with sizable migrant populations, including inside a supermarket distribution center. The surge shows how even in countries that appear to be on track to safely resume normal life, the virus can quickly resurface. The Victoria outbreaks have stalled the reopening of state borders, undercut plans to create travel bubbles with other countries, and forced 300,000 people back into lockdown. On Tuesday, the authorities said that people in the 10 worst-affected postal codes would be confined to their homes, except for essential travel, for the next four weeks in an effort to stop the virus’s spread. International flights have been diverted from Melbourne, a city of almost five million people, and an inquiry has been opened into breaches in quarantine protocols. Officials continued door-knocking and blitz-testing efforts, warning that if residents did not comply, the whole state of Victoria, Australia’s second most populous, could be affected. “If someone comes to your doorstep and offers you a test, the right answer is yes,” Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, said at a news conference on Wednesday. “If this continues to get away from us, we will all be in lockdown,” he added. Before the Victoria outbreaks, the country was recording just a handful of new cases each week, and it had begun easing restrictions with the goal of reopening the country by the end of July. But over the past two weeks, Victoria has had daily double-digit increases in cases. Though this pales in comparison to places like the United States that have tens of thousands of new cases each day, the rise has rattled the Australian authorities, who have held up the country’s extensive testing program, and its early lockdowns, as keys to its success. The surge in Victoria follows a familiar pattern: Public health officials around the globe have warned that flare-ups are inevitable even in countries that have largely suppressed the virus as restrictions on people’s movement are loosened. In China, an outbreak linked to a food market struck Beijing last month, and the authorities responded with targeted lockdowns and widespread testing, a model now being followed in Australia. In Singapore, the virus rapidly multiplied in dormitories crowded with migrant workers. In Australia, the coronavirus has taken hold in pockets around Melbourne where government messaging has not always been effective because of language barriers and other problems like distrust of the authorities. Fears of testing for the virus run high, and people with low incomes may be less able to stay home from work when ill. Some of these areas also experience high rates of homelessness and overcrowding, making it difficult for people to adhere to social-distancing guidelines. “If some of them don’t go to work, and they’re not on the JobKeeper and JobSeeker, they are left on charity to survive,” said Eddie Micallef, the chair of the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria, referring to government subsidy measures. The dangers were foreshadowed in May, when a panel of doctors and experts warned the Australian government that it had missed an opportunity to protect migrant communities. Mr. Micallef and other community leaders said communication by the state and federal authorities to high-risk groups had fallen short of what would have been necessary to prevent infections. Some said that translated information took too long to reach them, and was not clear. “You almost need a university degree to try to understand it,” Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the chief executive of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia, said of a multi-page document on the coronavirus that the government had translated into Arabic. He and other experts also warned that lockdowns enforced by the police — especially at a time of global scrutiny of police abuses — may only harm communities already wary of the authorities and exacerbate their sense of isolation. “We have to get people to understand the importance of being home. That’s not through fines and that’s not through over-policing,” said Rebecca Wickes, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Migration and Inclusion Center at Monash University in Melbourne. “That’s not going to create the behavior change that we are looking for.” She added that while a first wave of racism related to the coronavirus had targeted people of Asian descent, a second wave against migrant and ethnic communities was emerging because of misconceptions that these groups did not heed public health advice. Leaders in the Islamic community also said they worried that anti-Muslim sentiment had risen after reports that one of Melbourne’s clusters had originated at an Eid celebration last month.

Teetering Independence of Ukraine’s Central Bank Tests a Key I.M.F. Demand,2020-07-02,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — The Ukrainian government plunged into another round of turmoil over foreign aid and anti-corruption policy when the director of the nation’s central bank resigned this week, citing political pressure in violation of International Monetary Fund guidelines. President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian, won his office last year on promises to fight corruption. But his star has dimmed in recent months as high-level officials have quit or been fired, many accusing him of backsliding and insider dealing. Still, the I.M.F. approved an emergency $5 billion, 18-month lending program for Ukraine last month, in part to help the country overcome the coronavirus crisis. In a statement, the fund noted three times that it expected Ukraine to maintain the independence of its central bank. That independence is one safeguard preventing politically connected oligarchs from siphoning off aid. During a previous I.M.F. lending program, for example, the Ukrainian government bailed out a bank co-owned by a former business partner of Mr. Zelensky, a banking and media tycoon named Ihor Kolomoisky. The episode cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The fund transferred the first, $2.1 billion installment of the new loan to Ukraine on June 12. Just under three weeks into the 18-month agreement, on Wednesday, the central bank director, Yakiv Smoliy, resigned, saying political pressure on the central bank had become intolerable. Mr. Smoliy, in his resignation letter, did not specify exactly how he had been pressured, or by whom. In his resignation letter to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Smoliy cited “systematic political pressure.” He wrote that, “I seek to warn against other attempts to undermine the institutional foundations of the Central Bank of Ukraine.” The I.M.F. issued a statement on Thursday saying, again, that “the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine is at the center of Ukraine’s fund-supported program.” In a joint statement, Western ambassadors in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, warned of undercutting the central bank’s independence. “To undermine this crucial institution would be a big step back and jeopardize the credibility of and support for Ukraine’s reforms,” the statement said. Mr. Zelensky’s office issued a statement saying that “ensuring the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine remains our unconditional priority” but offering no explanation for Mr. Smoliy’s abrupt resignation.

‘I Thought I Would Die’: Inside Myanmar’s Risky Pursuit of Jade,2020-07-03,By Saw Nang and Richard C. Paddock,"['MANDALAY, Myanmar — An ominous rumbling was the only warning the young jade miner had that something was wrong. Within seconds he was running, but before he could take even a few steps he was swept away by a huge wave of mud and water. Tumbling underwater, he managed to reach the surface, swimming for half an hour before finding land. “I thought I would die,” said the miner, Ko Aung Kyaw Htay, 23, on Friday, a day after the disaster at Wai Khar mine in northern Myanmar left an estimated 200 people dead. “I still can’t believe I escaped. I have no idea what happened to the other people working around me. I guess they all died.” Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay was one of hundreds of unauthorized jade pickers scavenging on the edges of the Wai Khar open-pit mine in Kachin State, the lucrative center of Myanmar’s jade trade where rebels and government forces are facing off, when disaster struck. Heavy rains from the annual monsoon had filled the giant mine with water, creating a lake. Just after sunrise on Thursday, a wall of the mine collapsed, crashing into the lake and generating a wave more than 20 feet high. He survived with only scratches. But he saw no sign of 50 other miners who were working nearby when the wave hit. By Friday afternoon, searchers had recovered 172 bodies floating on the lake or washed ashore at the mine in Hpakant township. An additional 54 were injured. Similar disasters are an almost annual occurrence in the jade fields of Myanmar, which produce about 70 percent of the world’s jade and generate billions of dollars a year. Most of the jade mined there is exported across the border into China. The jade industry, largely controlled by the military and its crony companies, operates in near secrecy. The military is in constant conflict with rebel groups in the region, including the Kachin Independence Army, which is seeking self-rule and is said to extract its own revenues from mining operations. Jade pickers say the rebel group assesses fees for letting them operate on the fringes of the government-authorized mining operations. About 300,000 miners come from all over the country to hunt for jade — about two-thirds of them working illegally — even though it is extremely hazardous. Small landslides, which go unnoticed in the outside world, kill 100 or more miners a year. Major mine collapses, like the Wai Khar disaster, occur nearly annually. “Actually people are dying from accidents almost every day here,” said U Tin Soe, who represents the region in Parliament. “We just don’t have a record of it.” The Wai Khar mine, which is operated legally by a consortium of five companies, had officially shut down Tuesday for the rainy season because of the danger of landslides. It will reopen in October. But the jade pickers — who often work for local bosses and must pay a share of their earnings to rebel groups that operate in the area — immediately moved into the mine this week despite the risk. Mr. Tin said the nature of the region and the miners’ desperation make it difficult to prevent frequent disasters. “There is no rule of law in this area,” he said. “All the miners have to take responsibility for the continuous landslides in Hpakant. It happens because of their greed. Nobody can stop it.” Daw Moe Thandar and her younger brother, Ko Moe Myint, came to Hpakant two years ago from the city of Thandwe in Rakhine state to work as unauthorized jade pickers. Mr. Moe Myint, 20, began work early on Thursday at the Wai Khar mine. His sister, 28, learned of the landslide around 8 a.m. and raced there. She found her brother lying on the ground in a row of dead bodies. “That moment was like the end of my world to see my little brother lying there,” she said. “I feel like someone took my life too.” She said she worried her aging parents would be overcome by grief at hearing the news. “We just wanted to have enough money to survive,” she said, crying. “But our lives are gone.” Myanmar, also known as Burma, was controlled for decades by the military, which still maintains vast authority and operates autonomously under the 2008 Constitution that it enacted. The military owns two large conglomerates, which have extensive operations in a wide range of businesses, including jade. A study by the anti-corruption group Global Witness found that Myanmar’s jade business was worth as much as $31 billion in 2014, almost half the country’s gross domestic product. “The government has turned a blind eye to continued illicit and rapacious mining practices in Hpakant despite vowing to reform the hazardous sector,” said Paul Donowitz, campaign leader at Global Witness. “This was an entirely preventable tragedy that should serve as an urgent wake-up call for the government.” Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay, the survivor of the Wai Khar disaster, moved to the region three years ago from the city of Magway in central Myanmar. Until a few months ago, he worked independently as a jade picker and said he had to pay a share of his earnings directly to the Kachin Independence Army. His biggest find was a piece of jade he sold for $2,200. He said he paid nearly $600 of it to the rebels. “People from the KIA are everywhere and they can smell who is selling the jade and who has the good quality jade,” he said, referring to the rebel group. “If you don’t pay you will be shot and die anonymously.” Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay said he recently decided to work for a local mining boss because he could no longer make it on his own after the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Myanmar has been largely unaffected by the virus, at least according to official data, with only 304 reported cases and six deaths in a population of 54 million. But the pandemic has largely shut down the global market for jade, especially in China, and Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay said he could not survive without buyers. The boss, who operates outside the law like his pickers, typically pays for food and a place to stay and keeps half of whatever they find. Despite Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay’s narrow escape, and the scratches on his arms, legs and face, he has no intention of quitting. “There is no other job for me,” he said. “It’s better to die than to live with nothing to eat. I know this work is very dangerous, but living in hunger is just as dangerous.” And unlike on other jobs, if his luck holds in the jade mines, he hopes one day that he will strike it rich. “If I find a good quality, high-price piece of jade,” he said, “my dream is to buy a house in my hometown and marry a beautiful girl.” Saw Nang reported from Mandalay, Myanmar, and Richard C. Paddock from Bangkok.']","A survivor was swept away by a wave of mud and water after the wall of a mine collapsed on Thursday, killing at least 200 people."
Turmoil at Funeral of Singer Shows Ethiopia’s ‘Combustible’ Politics,2020-07-02,By Abdi Latif Dahir and Tiksa Negeri,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — In life, Hachalu Hundessa’s protest songs roused and united Ethiopians yearning for freedom and justice. He is doing the same in death, with thousands flocking on Thursday to bury him in Ambo, the town 60 miles west of the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa where he was born and raised. Mr. Hundessa, 34, was shot on Monday night by unknown assailants in Addis Ababa and later died of his wounds in a hospital. His death has ignited nationwide protests that have killed 81 people, injured dozens of others and caused extensive property damage. The authorities have blocked the internet and arrested 35 people, including a prominent media magnate and government critic, Jawar Mohammed. On Thursday, groups of young men, some with machetes, roamed through neighborhoods in Addis Ababa, singling out people from rival ethnic groups for attacks — prompting the government to deploy soldiers to patrol the streets. And in Ambo, witnesses said that the police blocked some people from attending the singer’s funeral, even firing shots at them. The unrest, analysts say, threatens the stability of Africa’s second-most populous country and deepens the political crisis in a nation already undergoing a roller-coaster democratic transition. “I am in bitter sadness,” said Getu Dandefa, a 29-year-old university student. When he saw Mr. Hundessa’s coffin in Ambo, he said he dropped to the ground and started crying. “We lost our voice,” he said. “We will keep fighting until Hachalu gets justice. We will never stop protesting.” Mr. Hundessa’s funeral has brought tensions to a boiling point in a country already facing myriad political, economic and social challenges. The fury aroused by his death poses a challenge to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who rose to power in 2018 following a wave of antigovernment protests that Mr. Hundessa — a member of the country’s largest but historically marginalized ethnic group, the Oromo — helped to galvanize through his music. Since then, Mr. Abiy, an Oromo himself, has introduced a raft of changes aimed at dismantling Ethiopia’s authoritarian structure, releasing political prisoners, liberalizing the centralized economy, committing to overhaul repressive laws and welcoming back exiled opposition and separatist groups. In 2019, Mr. Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his initiative to resolve the decades-long conflict with neighboring Eritrea and for spearheading regional peace and cooperation in the Horn of Africa. A nation of about 109 million people, Ethiopia has one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, hosts the headquarters of the African Union, and is a key United States ally in the fight against terrorism. But while the 43-year-old prime minister has made great strides, the changes have unleashed forces that have produced a sharp increase in lawlessness in many parts of the country, with rising ethnic tensions and violence that have displaced 3 million people. Yohannes Gedamu, an Ethiopian lecturer in political science at Georgia Gwinnett College, in Lawrenceville, Ga., said that the ruling coalition had lost its grip on the structures it once used to maintain order in an ethnically and linguistically diverse nation. As a result, he added, as the country moves toward multiparty democracy, rival ethnic and political factions have clashed over resources, power and the country’s direction forward. The government has come under fire for failing to stop the killing of government critics and prominent figures, like the chief of staff of the Ethiopian Army, and its inability to rescue a dozen or more university students abducted months ago. In combating the disorder, the authorities have resorted to the tactics of previous, repressive governments, not only blocking the internet, but arresting journalists and enacting laws that human rights advocates say could limit freedom of expression. Ethiopian security forces have been accused of gross human rights violations, including rape, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings. The coronavirus pandemic has complicated all this, leading the government to postpone August elections that many saw as a critical test of Mr. Abiy’s reform agenda. The move drew condemnation from opposition parties, who fear the government will use the delay to attempt a power grab. “The last few days demonstrate just how combustible the situation in Ethiopia is,” said Murithi Mutiga, the project director for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group. He added: “The merest spark can easily unleash all these bottled up, ethnonationalist passions that have become the defining feature of Ethiopian politics, especially as it goes through this very delicate transition.” While Mr. Abiy has a daunting task at hand, many say the government’s forceful response to the recent discontent could make matters worse. Laetitia Bader, the Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the group had received reports that security forces had used lethal force on protesters in at least seven towns. “The initial signs aren’t good,” Ms. Bader said. “The government needs to make clear that it is listening to these grievances, creating the space for them to be heard and adequately responding to them without resorting to repression or violence.” Given Mr. Hundessa’s stature, and how his music provided a stirring soundtrack against repression, the authorities should pull back and allow “people to grieve in peace,” said Henok Gabisa, the co-chairperson of the International Oromo Lawyers Association, based in St. Paul, Minn. About 200 of the city’s Oromo community protested on Tuesday. “The Oromo people are in disbelief, shocked and confused,” said Mr. Gabisa, who knew Mr. Hundessa and met him a few months ago in Ethiopia. But arresting political opposition leaders like Bekele Gerba, of the Oromo Federalist Congress party, and raiding Mr. Mohammed’s Oromia Media Network only risked inflaming long-simmering tensions, he said. “Abiy fumbled,” Mr. Gabisa said. “He dropped the ball.” Despite the recent upheaval, however, analysts still give Mr. Abiy high marks for his efforts to put Ethiopia on a new course. Mr. Gedamu said the prime minister had taken huge strides on multiple fronts, establishing the nationally unifying Prosperity Party, overseeing a record-breaking tree planting project to tackle climate change and expediting efforts to complete the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. That project has stoked conflict with Egypt over rights to the waters of the Nile, but would bolster Ethiopia’s electricity supply. “It is my understanding that revolutionary positive changes might actually take some time,” Mr. Gedamu said. “But overall, the gains of the reform outweigh the challenges.” For now, tensions remain high across Ethiopia as Mr. Hachalu is being laid to rest. The military was deployed to parts of the capital on Wednesday, and witnesses reported hearing gunshots. Rawera Daniel, 24, an unemployed university graduate in Addis Ababa, said the authorities should not crack down on citizens who want to mourn. On hearing of Mr. Hundessa’s death, “I cried like I lost my mother,” he said. “He fought for our freedom. His lyrics spoke on our behalf.” Mr. Mutiga, of the International Crisis Group, said that Mr. Abiy should rise to the occasion not just as a political leader but as Ethiopia’s healer in chief. “I think where Abiy definitely could do better is to try to fashion consensus,” he said, “persuade his opponents and be more deliberative and consultative and try to carry people along with him.” Abdi Latif Dahir reported from Nairobi, and Tiksa Negeri from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.']","At least 81 people have been killed and dozens injured in the unrest that followed the killing of Hachalu Hundessa, underscoring long-simmering tensions in the Horn of Africa nation."
Colombia Captures Guerrillas Accused in Deadly Car Bombing,2020-07-02,By Jenny Carolina González and Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Colombian authorities have captured eight members of a left-wing guerrilla group who helped carry out the deadliest attack in years in the capital city, Bogotá, officials said on Thursday. Prosecutors said the people arrested were members of the National Liberation Army, known as E.L.N., the rebel group that took responsibility for the car bombing at the National Police Academy in January 2019 that killed 22 cadets. The bombing shocked a country emerging from decades of civil war, and ended peace talks with the rebels. “Colombia lived a very painful moment,” President Iván Duque said in a national address after the arrests were announced, calling the bombing a “miserable terrorist attack that ended the lives of 22 students who chose the path of good, to study to serve their society.” The arrests and the investigation leading up to them allowed the police to dismantle both an urban guerrilla cell and the financial network of one of E.L.N.’s main groupings, which operates in the plains region in the east of the country. That network, “supplied resources, weapons, explosives and official uniforms and drugs to the urban guerrillas,” Mr. Duque said. He added that the raids provided further proof that E.L.N.’s top leadership was involved in the attack, weakening the already-dim prospect of restarting talks and reaching an agreement with the rebels. At the time of the attack, the group’s leaders were in negotiations in Havana with government representatives on a possible peace deal. The evidence could also raise tensions between Colombia and the Cuban government, which has declined to extradite top E.L.N. leaders residing there to face prosecution in Colombia. The arrests took place in a series of raids around Colombia, including one on a cheese warehouse in a working-class neighborhood of Bogotá, where officials said the car bomb was hidden prior to the attack. Prosecutors said the guerrillas financed the attack by funneling drug trafficking revenues from their dairy-rich rural strongholds to a series of fake cheese companies in the capital. Although the arrests dealt a blow to the E.L.N., they also revealed the group’s extensive presence in the most heavily-policed Colombian city and the sophistication of its financing and logistical networks. And the top E.L.N. leaders accused of masterminding the attack remain at large. “I don’t think this will be a big hit for the E.L.N., but it’s a necessary step by the government to investigate a crime that had such an impact on society,” said Luis Eduardo Celis, a Colombian security analyst. “E.L.N. is a complex organization that has very dynamic planning and financial capacity.” Formed in the 1960s, the rebel group has transformed from a rigidly Marxist guerrilla force, fighting to depose the country’s right-wing elites, to a multinational criminal organization financed increasingly by drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and extortion in neighboring Venezuela. The country’s largest leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, agreed to lay down the arms in 2016 after years of lengthy negotiations. Several right-wing paramilitary groups that fought in the civil war have also disbanded. The 2019 bomb attack dashed hopes for a final national reconciliation and brought back, for Bogotá residents, memories of nearly daily violence at the peak of the insurgency in the 1990s. Months after the policy academy explosion, factions of the FARC announced they were returning to the jungle to resume their fight. Their decision was prompted partly by a growing number of killings of left-leaning community leaders and Indigenous leaders in the countryside, which former FARC guerrillas say the government has done little to stem. The violence now threatens to unravel the already fragile peace deal.']","Members of E.L.N., a left-wing insurgency, were charged with taking part in the bombing of a police academy last year that killed 22 cadets, shaking a country emerging from a long civil war."
"How’s Your Quarantine? If No One’s Banging Gongs, Count Your Blessings",2020-07-04,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['YONGIN, South Korea — Spending two weeks quarantined in a hotel room is not a pleasant experience, as thousands of people who’ve flown internationally since the pandemic began can attest. But the 300 foreigners confined to a Ramada hotel in Yongin, South Korea, have it worse than most. Each day for the past week, from about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., protesters outside the hotel have been raising a deafening noise with drums, brass gongs and loudspeakers blaring music. They are local residents, angry that the government chose a hotel in their neighborhood as a quarantine site. “Even with double-glazed windows, they can still be heard when the windows are closed,” said James Martin Thompson, an app developer from Washington, from his fifth-floor room in the hotel, the Ramada by Wyndham Yongin. “When you’re stuck in a small indoor space 24/7, being able to open the windows makes it much more bearable,” Mr. Thompson said. “And during much of the daytime, that isn’t practical with the noise coming from the demonstrators.” On June 11, the South Korean government designated the Ramada as one of eight facilities where foreigners who arrive in the country with no Covid-19 symptoms are quarantined for two weeks. Three days later, a foreigner quarantined at the hotel tested positive for the coronavirus. Since then, residents of the neighborhood, called Jeondae-ri, have been accusing the government of recklessly exposing them to infection. On June 27, protesters began their daily noisemaking campaign in front of the 18-story hotel, hoping to force the authorities to send the foreigners elsewhere. “They turned the hotel into a quarantine center without any consultation with local residents,” said Ye Jeong-gyu, one of the protest leaders. “We didn’t find out about it until there was a sudden drop in the number of people visiting here, because our neighborhood has become a place to avoid since the case was discovered.” A large banner that protesters hung in front of the Ramada read, “This is a hotel that produced a confirmed Covid-19 case. Shut it down immediately!” Other banners called on residents to “protect our right to livelihood” by joining the protest. Under the government’s regulations, people quarantined in hotels cannot leave their rooms, and they can come to the door only four times a day — three times to pick up meals left by staff, and once to leave trash outside. Closed-circuit cameras monitor the Ramada’s corridors, and entrances are watched by police around the clock so that no one comes or goes without permission. That leaves the foreigners with little hope of escaping the daily torment, even if they wanted to try. Mr. Thompson, 59, whose quarantine began Sunday, has asked to be moved to a room at the back of the hotel, away from the protest site. But nearly every room was already taken by others in quarantine, and his request was rebuffed. The only suggestion that government officials could offer was to keep his windows shut, he said. He has been using noise-canceling headphones and a white-noise app to cope. “I feel sorry for residents who didn’t come equipped with them,” he said. Oh Sung-il, an official from the Ministry of Health and Welfare who oversees the quarantine at the Ramada, said protesters’ worries that Covid-19 might spread from the hotel were groundless. The one foreigner who tested positive for the virus was quickly moved to a separate facility, and there have been no cases at the hotel since, Mr. Oh said. But the protesters said fear of infection was enough to threaten their livelihoods. Restaurants, motels and other businesses in Jeondae-ri depend on visitors to nearby Everland, South Korea’s largest amusement park. They had already been badly hurt by the damage the pandemic did to Everland’s attendance figures. But things have gotten even worse since the Covid-19 case at the Ramada was confirmed, residents said. “Fewer people have stopped in our town as bad rumors about our town spread,” said Cha Ki-cheon, 59, who runs a 21-room motel in Jeondae-ri called Ever Park. “The rumor was more fearsome than the virus itself. If the government plans to run the quarantine center here until the epidemic is over, our local economy will be dead by then.” On Friday, dozens of protesters gathered for the daily vigil across the street from the Ramada, clanging gongs, shouting slogans and blaring protest songs through the loudspeakers. Many sat on the hot pavement and beat the ground with their shoes. They held signs condemning “evil forces that spread Covid-19.” The most earsplitting moment came when a dozen unionized truck drivers expressed solidarity by rolling slowly by in their big vehicles, blaring their horns. Yongin, a city of about a million people south of Seoul, the capital, has been in talks with the central government about financial support for businesses near the Ramada, Mayor Baek Gun-gi said at a news conference on Tuesday. Mr. Baek also said the city was looking for a new quarantine facility, farther away from residential areas. The Ramada has a three-month contract with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to house quarantined foreigners, but with no sign of the pandemic ending anytime soon, protesters fear the contract will be extended. The protesters are also demanding that the Ramada, which charges each person in quarantine about $100 a day, share some of the proceeds with the neighborhood, arguing that it is making money at the expense of other local businesses. The hotel’s management did not return calls seeking comment. Mr. Oh said the government was ready to talk with the protesters to help resolve their grievances. South Korea has won positive attention from around the world for its relatively successful efforts to curb the epidemic, and Mr. Oh expressed concern that the noise campaign would make the country look xenophobic. Some of the protesters said they shared that concern, but that they had been left with little choice. “We are sorry for the foreigners kept in the hotel. We can imagine how miserable they may be because of our noise,” Mr. Ye said. “But we are not mad at them. We are protesting for our own safety and livelihood.” Mr. Thompson said he had been traveling for the past year, mostly in Europe and East Asia, since giving up his Washington apartment and putting his things in storage. He has friends in South Korea and usually visits Seoul a couple of times a year. “Being a digital nomad seemed like an exciting prospect, and it’s been a fantastic experience — at least until the pandemic travel restrictions threw a wrench into the works,” he said. He is less than thrilled with the food at the Ramada, where he said a typical breakfast included “cold and limp French fries and a mostly black banana.” “But I’m grateful to be where I am, even if it means being confined to a small space for a couple of weeks,” he said. “Given the situation in the U.S., it seems like I got out just in time.”']","At one South Korean hotel, hundreds of quarantined foreigners are enduring noisy daily protests from local residents, who want them out."
George Floyd’s Killing Prompts Africans to Call for Police Reform at Home,2020-07-03,"By Abdi Latif Dahir, Ruth Maclean and Lynsey Chutel","['NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenyan and American protesters knelt outside the United States Embassy in Nairobi one morning last month, outraged at George Floyd’s killing and the racism and brutality they saw across the Atlantic. But they were also furious about police abuses at home, in Kenya. Protests sprang up all over town. In the large slum of Kibera, in front of a large mural of Mr. Floyd, residents chanted, “Stop killing us.” In front of Parliament, youths carried caskets to protest extrajudicial killings. “The image of George Floyd’s death was so visceral, so violent,” said Lilly Bekele-Piper, an Ethiopian-American who lives in Kenya and brought her four children to the protests. “People came out because they recognize that violence in their own communities.” Outrage over Mr. Floyd’s death has rippled throughout the continent, with Africans invoking the Black Lives Matter movement to call attention to abuses in their own countries and demand that the police be held to account. The protesters also point to the enduring legacy of European rule. Many African countries’ police forces were established in the colonial era and, analysts say, are still used by governments as an instrument of repression and control. Sick of killings, torture and beatings meted out, citizens are increasingly trying to push governments to reform the abusive institutions they inherited from colonial rulers. As in the United States, greater scrutiny — often enabled and amplified by social media — has sometimes led to the police being held accountable for their actions. But there has been little attempt at systemic change. Africans have long feared the violent methods used by police forces on the continent, but their alarm has become more immediate in recent months as the new coronavirus has taken hold, and governments have used heavy-handed tactics to enforce lockdowns. At the onset of Kenya’s overnight curfew in March, officers enforcing the restrictions shot and killed 13-year-old Yassin Moyo while he stood on his family’s balcony. In late June, three people were killed in a small town in Kenya’s Rift Valley after a confrontation with the police over face masks. Nigerian police officers enforcing a curfew also fatally shot a teenager, Tina Ezekwe, in May at a bus stop in the West African country’s biggest city, Lagos. In Uganda, security forces were accused in late March of shooting at construction workers and beating vegetable vendors who had not shut their businesses. Ugandan activists, including the prominent academic Stella Nyanzi, were arrested in May while protesting the lack of food being distributed to those in need. The police in Zimbabwe were accused in May of abducting and sexually assaulting three female opposition activists, who were dumped along a remote roadside after protesting the government’s handling of a weekslong lockdown. But it was the activists who were later arrested, charged with lying about having been kidnapped and tortured. And in South Africa, the police watchdog said that law-enforcement and army officers had killed 11 people during the country’s strict lockdown. Hundreds of thousands of people have been charged with lockdown infringements in South Africa as part of what their lawyers say is an overzealous enforcement effort. Kenya’s security services have long been accused of carrying out killings, abductions and torture. Human rights organizations documenting disappearances and extrajudicial killings say that 707 people have been killed by the police since 2007 — 95 of them this year. The Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi is among those who have placed the abuses against a broader backdrop, calling for the police to be “decolonized” and retrained to safeguard people’s rights.  Police forces across the African continent were established by colonial rulers to “conquer, repress, and dominate” the people, said Ruth Joyce Kaguta, who teaches criminology and law at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Kenya. “They were not created for the people.” Most African countries gained independence in the 1960s, and their police forces are no longer foreign: Officers, superintendents and inspectors general are all citizens of the countries in which they work. But successive governments have not reformed the colonial-era police structures they inherited, so police cadets in some cases are still taught that members of the public are “enemy No. 1,” said Agatha Ndonga, the head of the Kenya office of the International Center for Transitional Justice. “They did not change the attitude and culture of policing,” she said. “They don’t look at us as persons whom they should protect.” Reform has been slow in Kenya and elsewhere on the continent, Ms. Kaguta said, largely because presidents since independence have seen that using the police to repress citizens can help them stay in power. In the early 1990s in South Africa, Nelson Mandela’s government did try to turn the apartheid government’s 11 abusive police agencies into a single entity aimed at serving communities. But by 2010, fatigued by violent crime, the police and the government “abandoned the language of service and returned to apartheid’s signifier of force,” said Andrew Faull, author of “Behind the Badge: The Untold Stories of South Africa’s Police Service Members.” Afraid of losing their jobs, officers did not challenge the culture. “Abuse of force was tacitly accepted by many, in part justified by a belief that many South Africans think ‘criminals’ deserve violent punishment,” Mr. Faull said in an interview conducted in writing. After Kenyan police killed protesters in the aftermath of disputed elections in December 2007, there were efforts at reform, but they were very limited. But the police today face greater public scrutiny as more people across the continent buy smartphones. They film, upload and watch videos of the police attacking civilians on Facebook and WhatsApp. These videos circulate so fast, Ms. Ndonga said, that “there’s no way they can deny it’s happening. And of course, it makes them have no choice but to go and now start conducting investigations.” Responding to the cases that catch the public’s attention can yield haphazard results. With many Kenyans calling for justice for Yassin Moyo, the 13-year-old killed on his balcony, the case moved exceptionally quickly: An officer was charged with murder and arraigned in court within weeks. In less famous cases, the process can take more than a year. When video circulated of law enforcement officials from Cape Town in South Africa violently evicting a naked man from his home, a shack they wanted cleared from a township, the officials responsible were suspended. But violent evictions of South Africa’s poorest Black citizens are common. In Nigeria, the police immediately announced an investigation into Tina Ezekwe’s killing, and said two officers had been arrested. But accountability is very rare for abusive police units in Nigeria, in particular the Special Anti-Robbery Squad that is tasked with fighting violent crimes, according to a new report from Amnesty International. In some cases, police forces facing criticism have doubled down. When a Gambian man was recently shot by the police in the United States, the government of the West African country called for an investigation. But when the activist Madi Jobarteh called for justice for victims of police brutality at home in Gambia, as well as in the United States, he was arrested. Some see hope for systemic change in the period of reflection that the protests over George Floyd’s killing have produced, in Africa as well as America. Besides Kenya, demonstrations against Mr. Floyd’s death and in solidarity with American protesters have taken place outside U.S. embassies in Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia. In Dakar, Senegal’s capital, 50 protesters took a knee in June while facing the Atlantic Ocean, America on its long-distant horizon. “Black lives in our country can feel unsafe,” said Ms. Bekele-Piper in Nairobi. “To me, these are vestiges of colonialism and now that we have the attention of the world, we have the chance to push against it.” Abdi Latif Dahir reported from Nairobi, Ruth Maclean from Dakar, Senegal and Lynsey Chutel from Johannesburg, South Africa.']",Africans are increasingly pushing to hold police agencies to account and “decolonize” the repressive institutions they inherited from colonial rulers.
Duterte Signs Antiterrorism Bill in Philippines Despite Widespread Criticism,2020-07-03,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte signed a contentious antiterrorism bill Friday aimed at combating Islamic militancy in the south, a measure that critics warned could lead to more widespread human rights abuses. Muslims living in the southern Philippines have spoken out against the legislation to broaden powers of arrest and detention. On Friday, a regional government in the southern island of Mindanao that includes former separatist rebels urged Mr. Duterte’s government not to go through with the measure. The new law allows for terrorism suspects to be detained without a warrant, prolongs the amount of time that they can be detained without being charged in court, and removes a requirement that the police present suspects before a judge to assess whether they have been subjected to physical or mental torture. Rights groups and activists say the new law is designed to give Mr. Duterte’s police and military forces more powers to stifle dissent against his populist rule amid his war on drugs, which has killed thousands of people. Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said the new law was necessary to crack down on terrorism. “Terrorism, as we often said, strikes anytime and anywhere,” Mr. Roque said. “It is a crime against the people and humanity. Thus, the fight against terrorism requires a comprehensive approach.” He stressed that terrorist acts in the Philippines had long “caused unimaginable grief and horror,” and added that the president and his legal team had carefully reviewed the legislation before he signed it into law. The law was signed days after the police and military forces killed four people believed to be Filipino militants linked to the Islamic State during a raid in Manila. The militants were suspected of working as financial conduits for the local branch of the Islamic State, according to the military. Officials said they were working with Mundi Sawadjaan, one of the accused plotters behind the January 2019 bombing of a Catholic cathedral on the southern island of Jolo that killed 23 people. The attack was carried out by an Indonesian couple wearing suicide vests. They were believed to have been directed by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, the leader of the Islamic State in the Philippines and Mundi Sawadjaan’s relative. On Friday, Edre Olalia, of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, said the group would challenge the “draconian law.” “This without a doubt is the most unpopular and perilous piece of legislation that could ever be pushed by a government that is fixated with the potion of power,” said Mr. Olalia, whose group represents activist and indigent groups. Human Rights Watch said the new law gave security forces the power to arrest activists, journalists and social media users by simply saying that they are suspected of terrorist activities. “The law threatens to significantly worsen the human rights situation in the Philippines, which has nose-dived since the catastrophic war on drugs began four years ago,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for the group. He said the law gave the green light for the “systematic targeting” of Mr. Duterte’s critics, as well as Filipinos who speak out against the his government. Human Rights Watch expressed particular concern with provisions that permit warrantless arrests and allow people to be kept for weeks in solitary detention, elements that Mr. Robertson said could facilitate torture. Earlier this week, Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, released a report that attributed thousands of “systematic” killings that were done with “near-total impunity” to Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs. “The campaign against illegal drugs is being carried out without due regard for the rule of law, due process, and the human rights of people who may be using or selling drugs,” she said. Ms. Bachelet cited “an unwillingness by the state to hold to account perpetrators of extrajudicial killings,” and had urged Mr. Duterte not to sign the antiterrorism bill, which she said blurred distinctions between what is criticism of the government and what is terrorism.']",Human rights groups say the new law will give the police and military forces more powers to stifle dissent.
"Hong Kong, Changed Overnight, Navigates Its New Reality",2020-07-05,"By Vivian Wang, Elaine Yu and Tiffany May","['HONG KONG — A barge draped with enormous red banners celebrating China’s new security law was sailing across Hong Kong’s famed Victoria Harbor only hours after the legislation passed. The police now hoist a purple sign warning protesters that their chants could be criminal. Along major roads throughout the city, neon-colored flags hailing a new era of stability and prosperity stand erect as soldiers. In recent days, as China took a victory lap over the law it imposed on the city Tuesday, the defiant masses who once filled Hong Kong’s streets in protest have largely gone quiet. Sticky notes that had plastered the walls of pro-democracy businesses vanished, taken down by owners suddenly fearful of the words scribbled on them. Parents whispered about whether to stop their children from singing a popular protest song, while activists devised coded ways to express now-dangerous ideas. Seemingly overnight, Hong Kong was visibly and viscerally different, its more than seven million people left to navigate what the law would mean to their lives. The territory’s distinct culture of political activism and free speech, at times brazenly directed at China’s ruling Communist Party, appeared to be in peril. For some who had been alarmed by the ferocity of last year’s unrest, which at times transformed shopping districts, neighborhoods and university campuses into smoke-filled battlefields, the law brought relief and optimism. For others, who had hoped the desperate protest campaign would help secure long-cherished freedoms, it signaled a new era of fear and uncertainty. “This is home,” said Ming Tse, sitting in the cafe he manages, which once loudly supported the protesters. “But I don’t think this place loves us anymore.” For months, Mr. Tse’s love for his home was advertised at his shop in the working-class neighborhood of North Point. The oat milk carton at the cash register sat behind postcards of protest art. A poster condemned the police shootings of two student demonstrators. Even after opponents of the movement threatened to vandalize the shop last fall, the decorations stayed. But on Thursday, Mr. Tse, 34, took everything down. News reports said police officers had interrogated owners of restaurants with similar protest paraphernalia. The security law criminalizes “subversion” of the government, a crime that the police say encompasses speech such as political slogans. All that remained was a small plastic dinosaur on the counter, wearing a yellow hard hat. That inexpensive yet tough headgear, worn by protesters who fought with the police, had become a symbol of their scrappy fortitude. “I don’t know if they are so sensitive,” Mr. Tse said. “It’s just a helmet on a dinosaur.” He paused, then reconsidered: “Actually, everything is sensitive.” That the lines of criminality had been redrawn became clear on Friday, when the authorities charged a 24-year-old man with terrorism and inciting separatism — the first person to be indicted under the new law. With a “Liberate Hong Kong” flag mounted on the back of his motorcycle, the man careened into a group of police officers on Wednesday, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China from British rule. Most years, that holiday draws large pro-democracy rallies. But this time, they were banned. Protests were scattered, and the police swept in and arrested hundreds. Ten people, including a 15-year-old girl, were accused of “inciting subversion,” a vaguely defined crime under the new law; some had merely waved flags, bearing slogans that had never been explicitly outlawed. A few dozen relatives and social workers waited on Thursday outside a police station in North Point where more than 100 of those arrested were being held. Such vigils had become a rite for protesters’ loved ones. But this one felt more perilous, with crimes under the security law punishable by life imprisonment in the most serious cases. A Chinese official said Wednesday that the law was meant to hang over would-be troublemakers like the sword of Damocles. The police collected DNA samples and searched the homes of the 10 people arrested on suspicion of inciting subversion — measures that seemed excessive when applied to people accused only of possessing pamphlets, said Janet Pang, a lawyer who is helping some of them. “You’re supposed to only use power that is necessary, and that’s how the law should be,” she said. Shortly after noon on Thursday, a pro-democracy activist, Tam Tak-chi, emerged from the station, where he had spent the night after being detained. Mr. Tam met a young man inside who said he had been arrested after the police found a banner in his bag reading “Hong Kong Independence, the Only Way Out.” The man wept on his shoulder, Mr. Tam said. The Hong Kong government has insisted that free speech is not under threat. But on Saturday, the city’s public library system said that books by some prominent activists had been removed from circulation while officials reviewed whether they violated the new law. The censorship has crept even into private homes. In June of last year, Katie Lam took her two young sons to a large rally. Her older son wore a cap that read “Hong Konger” and raised a handmade sign saying, “Don’t shoot us.” Now Ms. Lam, a data analyst, is anxious about what her sons say at home. One of them is having a birthday party in two weeks, and Ms. Lam wondered if she should hide a print displayed on the piano that reads “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times,” a slogan that the government says could be considered subversive. The boys loved singing “Glory to Hong Kong,” the unofficial anthem of the protest movement. She worries that the neighbors will hear it. “Even though we all knew it would happen one day,” she said of China’s intervention, “it’s still painful.” But in some corners of the city, China’s move has been welcome. The successive blows of the unrest, followed by the coronavirus pandemic, emptied malls and grounded flights, eviscerating Hong Kong’s economy. The security law, however unpopular, seemed poised to end the monthslong impasse over the protests. It was Hong Kong’s prosperity and worldliness that drew Harry He, 33, to the city from mainland China 10 years ago. He earned master’s degrees in finance and engineering and fell in love with his new home: its efficient public transportation, its high food-safety standards. He got married, found work as an insurance agent, bought a home, had a daughter. Last year shattered that serenity. Once, while he was eating at a restaurant with friends, masked protesters smashed a nearby sushi restaurant owned by a company seen as pro-Beijing, he said. His mainland clients began avoiding Hong Kong. Mr. He said he had supported the protesters at first. But he soon grew convinced that the authorities needed to restore stability, and that the security law would do so. “I just don’t want to see violence again,” he said in an interview in his office tower in Tsim Sha Tsui, a luxury shopping district that was battered by street fighting. “I just want Hong Kong to be as developed and prosperous as before.” Still, even some who embraced stability wondered about its price. Just as core to Hong Kong’s identity as its freewheeling capitalism has been its proud, even gleeful, outspokenness. Street booths often lined the city’s busiest shopping districts, blasting dueling political messages. Tiny bookstores crammed into overpriced commercial spaces hawked volumes that were banned in the mainland. Xu Zhe, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, said the law was needed to address the “terrorism” committed by some protesters. He had been horrified by a clash in November, when some demonstrators poured gasoline on a man who had scolded them, then set him ablaze. But Mr. Xu also worried that the law could be used to clamp down on dissent, including speech. Mr. Xu, who grew up on the mainland before attending university in Hong Kong, had never had a chance to protest at home. Last year, he attended his first demonstration, a small gathering against violence. If Hong Kongers lost the right to protest, he said, “I would feel deeply, deeply regretful.” Few people in the city know the price of protest better than Rowena He, a historian at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Professor He has studied the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, when Chinese troops gunned down protesters in Beijing. Her office is an informal museum of the massacre, with a miniature replica on her bookshelf of the “Goddess of Democracy” statue that the Tiananmen protesters erected shortly before the killings. On Wednesday, the day after the security law was enacted, one of Professor He’s students decided to walk around Hong Kong, documenting a city on the cusp of change. He sent her a photo of a row of Chinese flags, flapping in the wind. On a sidewalk railing nearby, a banner supporting a pastor imprisoned on the mainland had been ripped in half. “You are a real historian,” Professor He responded. Even as old markers of resistance have come down, subtler ones have surfaced. Some protesters have turned to puns and created new meaning from well-worn phrases, a tactic long adopted by mainland internet users to skirt government censorship. On Wednesday, in one of the city’s commercial hubs, someone had spray-painted “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves” — the opening line of China’s national anthem. And one shop, in place of protest slogans, hung up nearly two dozen posters of propaganda from Mao-era China, including one that proclaimed: “Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is reasonable.” Bella Huang contributed research.']","In a city where China has made some ideas suddenly dangerous, people are trying to figure out where the boundaries lie, and how their lives have changed."
Severe Flooding in Southern Japan Swamps Nursing Home,2020-07-04,By Gerry Mullany,"['Torrential rains in southern Japan caused widespread flooding and mudslides on Saturday, with at least 16 people dead as officials warned 75,000 residents to evacuate. The public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday that at least 16 people had died, including at least 14 at a nursing home. Another 17 were feared dead. Thirteen others were reported missing. Japan has been battered by heavy flooding from typhoons and other storms in recent years, with its mountainous terrain leaving it prone to mudslides and inundations. Such storms have taken hundreds of lives, and climatologists say the problem has been exacerbated by global warming. This time, the flooding overnight was centered in the prefectures of Kagoshima and Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyushu. The two prefectures ordered the evacuation of 75,000 residents. Officials in Kumamoto said that two lifeless bodies had been pulled from mudslides in the area and that one other person was missing. Kumamoto’s governor, Ikuo Kabashima, said that floodwaters and mud had gushed into the nursing home, leaving scores stranded, NHK reported. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with aides to devise a response to the flooding, and 10,000 members of Japan’s defense force were mobilized for rescue efforts. The Kuma River in Kumamoto was flooded and one of its bridges washed away, NHK reported. Kyushu Electric Power said that at least 8,000 homes had been left without power as a result of the flooding. While the rains subsided in the afternoon and evening, forecasters say heavy rains could continue in the area though midweek. Motoko Rich contributed reporting.']",Officials said that at least 16 people had died as a result of the deluge and mudslides that struck the island of Kyushu overnight.
Macron Replaces France’s Prime Minister in Bid to Reinvigorate His Government,2020-07-03,By Adam Nossiter and Aurelien Breeden,"['PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron shuffled prime ministers on Friday, removing the most popular member of his government and a potential rival in a bid to get a fresh start in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak that has hit France hard. Mr. Macron traded in his prime minister of three years, Édouard Philippe, for a relatively unknown technocrat, Jean Castex, who has helped guide France out of the health emergency. But the president has taken a chance in distancing himself from Mr. Philippe: The outgoing prime minister is the only French political leader to emerge from the health crisis with sharply enhanced credibility. By pushing out Mr. Philippe, Mr. Macron is testing the adage that, in politics, it is better to keep one’s rivals close at hand. Mr. Macron made the move in the face of an economic emergency brought on by the virus, by his own tenuous public support and by a surge in popularity for Green parties in local voting last Sunday. But Mr. Castex is not an environmentalist nor a leftist, suggesting Mr. Macron was not cowed by the election results nor by demands that he change his pro-business stance. The contemptuous reactions of French Greens and Socialists to Friday’s news suggested as much. By appointing Mr. Castex, the low-profile mayor of a modest town in the French Pyrenees who has shaped France’s so far successful strategy to ease lockdown restrictions, Mr. Macron is signaling that he is looking ahead. In doing so he is butting up against public opinion, though, as a new poll revealed this week that nearly 60 percent of the French wanted Mr. Philippe to stay in his post. That in itself was a problem for Mr. Philippe, as was his recent appearance on the cover of Paris Match as France’s real strongman. Mr. Macron “is very self-confident, he doesn’t want to be put in the shade by anybody,’’ said Gerald Grunberg, an emeritus political scientist at Sciences Po university. “He doesn’t want to be the president of Edouard Philippe’s government.” Replacing prime ministers, like firing managers in baseball, is a well-established tradition for modern French presidents looking to create new energy. Mr. Macron, 42, has two years to go in a rocky five-year term that has been marked by social unrest, some economic progress and, now, a shaky business outlook. G.D.P. is expected to drop 11 to 13 percent this year. For weeks, speculation about the fate of Mr. Philippe — who served an unusually long spell for a French prime minister — had swirled in the news media and in political circles. Mr. Macron had been expected to reshape his cabinet after the coronavirus dealt a heavy blow to France, hoping to give his government a fresh mandate in the last stretch of a five-year term that ends in 2022. “There had to be a new signal, a new conquest of the French, because we’ve lost so many,” said Patrick Vignal, a parliamentary deputy in Mr. Macron’s party from southern France. “So Emmanuel Macron was right to turn tables and name a new prime minister.” Mr. Grunberg noted that polls suggested Mr. Philippe could be the only political figure with enough standing to take on Mr. Macron in two years. Not a single other serious potential challenger has emerged on either the right or the left. Yet by the telling of the Élysée Palace, the seat of the French presidency, the parting was cordial, and the choice of Mr. Castex a natural one because he was seen as transcending the right-left divide, an intense focus of Mr. Macron. Mr. Castex, 55, is a graduate of the same elite finishing school for technocrats, the E.N.A., or National Management School, as both Mr. Macron and Mr. Philippe. Yet Mr. Macron’s supporters on Friday portrayed Mr. Castex as a son of the soil. “Jean Castex represents the Old World, a rural elected official who has had to face real problems,” Mr. Vignal said. “He’s a graduate of E.N.A., sure, but he’s got his feet in the muck, and his head in the stars.” Later on Friday, the Élysée announced that Mr. Philippe, who was re-elected mayor of Le Havre last weekend, would be given a new role in helping shape Mr. Macron’s Republic on the Move political movement. The reshuffle came the same day that French prosecutors announced that Mr. Philippe was one of three current or former officials under investigation for possible mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. But the process is in a very preliminary stage and might not lead to formal charges or trial. France is still dealing with the aftermath of the initial coronavirus outbreak, which has led to nearly 30,000 deaths in the country. France fared worse than Germany in deaths and cases, but considerably better than its northern and southern neighbors, including Britain. The shake-up was all the more expected after a strong showing by Green parties in France’s municipal elections last week, which intensified pressure on Mr. Macron to change his governing team. Mr. Macron’s party failed to field serious candidates in any of the major cities, a sign of its grass-roots weakness, and the Greens took Bordeaux, Lyon and Strasbourg. Unlike many of its European neighbors, France has a system of government in which the president, elected directly by the French people, is the head of the executive branch and is usually the main policy driver. The prime minister and cabinet are accountable to Parliament, but are appointed by the president and responsible for day-to-day governing. Mr. Philippe had won plaudits and popularity as a calm, steady presence during the initial wave of the virus. Where Mr. Macron lectured his countrymen in lofty, lengthy and martial declarations about France’s state of “war,” Mr. Philippe delivered unvarnished facts. He laid out the steps toward easing the country’s lockdown without sugarcoating the challenges or exaggerating the dangers. In an interview on Thursday with France’s regional press, Mr. Macron praised Mr. Philippe for helping him carry out “important historic reforms in circumstances that were often very hard” and said they had a special “relationship of trust.” “I will have choices to make to lead the new way,” Mr. Macron said of a cabinet reshuffle. He said that “there will be a new team,” suggesting that much of the cabinet could disappear along with Mr. Philippe. Mr. Philippe, 49, was a relatively unknown mayor of Le Havre, a port town in northern France, when Mr. Macron appointed him prime minister in 2017. He helped shepherd some of Mr. Macron’s most important and contested legislative efforts, especially the fiercely fought overhaul of France’s crazy-quilt pension system, which is still in the works. But Mr. Philippe is much more a man of France’s traditional right. “People like Edouard Philippe are very attached to balanced budgets,” said Mr. Grunberg, the political scientist. “Macron is not like that.”']","President Emmanuel Macron is reshaping his cabinet, starting with the removal of his popular prime minister, in a bid to give his government a fresh start in the last stretch of his term."
Australia Faces Its Own Reckoning Over Diversity in Media,2020-07-03,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. This week’s issue is written by Besha Rodell, a columnist for the Australia bureau. In the 1980s, my mother was a reporter in Melbourne, where much of her work focused on the Indigenous communities in Victoria. She recently told me about a time when she went to her editors at The Age and suggested that they actively seek out and recruit young Indigenous reporters because — while she felt she had earned the trust of her sources — their stories would be better told by people from that community. Hiring a more diverse staff, she explained, would be better for journalism and better for the newspaper. She did not get the response she hoped for. “They looked at me like I had two heads,” she said. Last month, echoing her experience, a group of more than 60 journalists at The Age wrote a letter to their top editors and executives of the Nine corporation, which now owns The Age, expressing distress with a number of issues at the paper, including its lack of diversity. “As far as we are aware the Age has had only one Indigenous reporter in its 166-year history,” they wrote. “Every editor in the Age’s history has been a white man, as is every current foreign correspondent.” The Age is not the only media institution in Australia reckoning with a lack of diversity. A group of journalists have written a letter calling for more diversity on Melbourne Press Club’s all-white board. Australia’s public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, have come under fire in recent weeks, with a number of nonwhite journalists describing incidents of racism at SBS — a station with diversity as a central part of its mission, but with a leadership team that does not reflect that mandate. It’s one of the many ways that the Black Lives Matter movement in the U.S. has inspired Australians to examine issues of race in our own country. Large protests in Australian cities supported Black Americans demanding justice after the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, while also calling attention to Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. And within media and culture, calls for diversification just keep rippling through the landscape. I have barely slept in recent weeks, trying to keep up as Bon Appétit’s editor in chief Adam Rappaport resigned over various accusations of racism, and as people called for the resignation of John T. Edge, director of the influential Southern Foodways Alliance. (I have written for Bon Appétit in the past and was a speaker at a Southern Foodways Alliance symposium in 2015 as well as having written for its magazine, Gravy.) Australian food media is likely due for its own reckoning. I was contacted this week by a group of freelance writers who are hoping to diversify the voices and content represented in Australian food media, and are aiming to put specific plans in place to achieve that goal. I keep thinking about my mother’s experience in the ’80s, and how different our media might look now if any of her former editors had heeded her call to actively seek out and recruit reporters from within the communities she was covering. I’m sure she was not the only one to suggest such a thing, and it’s entirely possible that the media landscape would have been so difficult and hostile for nonwhite journalists that the difference would be minimal. But if there had been a concerted effort to engage, hire, retain and support a diverse range of journalists 30 years ago, Australian media would surely be far better for it today.

Severe Floods in China Leave Over 106 Dead or Missing,2020-07-03,By Raymond Zhong,"['In the inland Chinese city of Yichang, the murky water ran waist-high, stranding people in their cars and turning streets into canals. Near the metropolis of Chongqing, angry torrents of water swept away country roads. The tourist town of Yangshuo experienced a cloudburst that an official called a once-in-two-centuries event. Weeks of abnormally intense rains have wrought destruction across southern China, leaving at least 106 people dead or missing and affecting 15 million residents in the worst flooding that parts of the region have seen in decades. One of the hardest-hit provinces has been Hubei, whose capital, Wuhan, also had the first emergence of the coronavirus last year. Late last month, rescuers smashed car windows to free passengers trapped by floodwater in Yichang, a city in Hubei down the Yangtze River from the Three Gorges Dam, one of the world’s largest. Hubei has had more coronavirus cases than any other part of China. And people there said the last thing they needed was another devastating jolt to their lives, their health and their livelihoods. “Another problem has arisen before the last one subsided,” Deng Jin, 25, a recent college graduate from the city of Enshi, lamented recently on the social platform Weibo. “Hubei in 2020 is both surreal and difficult.” Heavy rains this time of year often swell China’s rivers and cause its reservoirs to overflow. This year, however, the battle against the coronavirus pandemic strained flood preparations, People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, warned in April. The epidemic, combined with the extreme rain, has made dealing with this year’s flooding a “very formidable” task, China’s postal agency wrote in a recent memo urging the authorities to step up their response to the floods, People’s Daily reported this week. After 31 consecutive days of official alerts about torrential rain, the inclement weather shows little sign of letting up. On Friday, the National Meteorological Center forecast another round of downpours in China’s southwest beginning on Saturday. Experts are warning of potential landslides and bursts at reservoirs and dams. In China, most small reservoirs were built in the 1960s and ’70s and did not follow high construction standards, said Brandon Meng, a hydraulic engineer in the southern city of Shenzhen. “Once there is extreme weather,” he said, “it’s very easy for them to be in danger.” As the rains were becoming intense last month, some commentators in China noted how little attention they were receiving, both in Chinese news outlets and on social media. Surely, they said, the confluence of a great plague and great floods should merit wider interest. Perhaps people had grown numb to hardship. Or perhaps China’s government and its censors did not want to draw more attention to people’s suffering. Either way, videos and firsthand accounts of the flooding have since gained wider notice. In Yangshuo, a popular travel destination known for its stunning mountain vistas, an official told the newsmagazine Southern Weekly that the area had experienced a once-in-two-centuries burst of heavy rain on June 7. More than 1,000 hotels and guesthouses and 5,000 shops were damaged, the authorities told Southern Weekly. Qin Hui, a retired history professor, was vacationing in Yangshuo when the rain started coming down in buckets last month. He and his travel partners tried to evacuate but decided that it was too dangerous. They were eating breakfast the next morning when they caught a disturbing sight. “The swimming pool outside the window suddenly went from clear to muddy,” Mr. Qin recounted in an online essay. “It turned out to be floodwater coming in from the tube at the bottom of the pool. Soon after, the murky water flooded out of the pool, quickly covered the yard and then flowed up the stairs.” They were trapped in their hotel for two nights until a volunteer team rescued them. In Chongqing, the city authorities said last month that flooding along the local section of the Qijiang River, upstream from the Yangtze, was the worst since monitoring began in 1940. About 40,000 residents were evacuated, according to official news outlets. Chongqing is in a mountainous part of China, and many structures are built directly into hillsides. A video from one district showed brown water gushing out of an upper window of a residential building, like an artificial waterfall.

"After Fighting Plastic in ‘Paradise Lost,’ Sisters Take On Climate Change",2020-07-03,By Richard C. Paddock and Nyimas Laula,"['SEMINYAK, Indonesia — It was trash season on Bali, the time of year when monsoon storms wash up tons of plastic debris onto the island’s beaches. It was also the time for two teenage sisters, Melati and Isabel Wijsen, to organize their annual island cleanup. Standing on the back of a flatbed truck, megaphones in hand, they kicked off a day of trash collecting at 115 sites around the island. Thousands of people came out to help. “Not only the beaches, we clean up the rivers, we clean up the streets,” Melati Wijsen called out on that February day to an early-morning crowd of hundreds of volunteers, many wearing shirts with the logos of local restaurants and hotels. “This movement is for everyone in Bali.” Melati was 12 and Isabel was 10 when they began a drive to ban plastic bags, at one point threatening a hunger strike to get the Bali governor’s attention. Now, seven years later, they have become local heroes and won international acclaim for their campaign, which resulted in Bali banning plastic bags and other such items that are intended for a single use. The sisters, now 19 and 17, are part of a young generation of global activists, including the 17-year-old Swedish climate-change advocate, Greta Thunberg, calling for urgent action to protect the planet. “Us kids may be only 25 percent of the world’s population, but we are 100 percent of the future,” Isabel likes to say. Since starting their campaign, the sisters have traveled around the world to speak at major events. At 15 and 13, they gave a Ted Talk in London on Bali’s trash crisis. Time magazine listed them among the Most Influential Teens and CNN applauded them as Young Wonders. Melati describes herself as a “change maker” and has been more visible in recent months, while Isabel has focused on finishing high school and taking care of her health after discovering that she has an autoimmune disorder. In January, Melati appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she spoke passionately about the need to pressure companies and governments to ban single-use plastic. Former Vice President Al Gore, who was on the panel with her, drew applause when he said, “Melati, I’m so impressed with you.” Now, the sisters are wrestling with a problem they could not have foreseen: how to be activists during a time of pandemic and social isolation. Shelter-at-home rules have increased the use of plastic both in packaging for delivered items and in protective gear for health care workers, dealing a “major setback” to the anti-plastic movement, Melati said. But she also welcomes the unintended benefits of widespread lockdowns in reducing pollution and allowing wildlife to return to some urban areas. Climate change, Melati said, should prompt officials to take similar, urgent action. “This is a virus that impacts us directly right now, but climate change will do the exact same thing,” she said. “One of the biggest things we have seen from the coronavirus is that government can act quickly. My question is: Why is that not the case when it comes to climate change?” While they may be young in years, the sisters are poised and practiced speakers who have given countless talks and interviews. They are also activists for the social media age, often posting videos and messages about their activities. The daughters of a Dutch mother, Elvira Wijsen, a consultant on sustainable business practices, and an Indonesian father, Eko Riyanto, the director of a furniture export business, they grew up on Bali surrounded by spectacular natural beauty and influenced by the Balinese tradition of living in harmony with nature. The family home is set on the edge of rice fields a short walk from the beach. But despite the idyllic setting, they have encountered plastic trash wherever they go — in the rice fields, at the beach and in the sea — for as long as they can remember. While plastic refuse is a problem everywhere, it is particularly acute in Bali, where it is common for people to toss garbage aside. Some dispose of plastic by burning it with other trash. But even more plastic is washed out to sea by the island’s numerous small rivers, where it drifts in the water, from the surface to the seabed, posing a hazard to aquatic creatures. It is especially bad during the rainy season —\xa0or trash season —\xa0generally from November to March. The sisters attended the private Green School, which says that its mission is teaching children to be leaders and “change makers.” Surrounded by jungle, the school’s elaborate bamboo structures have no walls, and its program promotes independent thinking and innovation. In 2013 the sisters, inspired by a lesson about the lives of Nelson Mandela and Mohandas K. Gandhi, did some research and found that Indonesia was the world’s second-largest source of marine plastic pollution, after China. They also discovered that dozens of jurisdictions around the world had banned single-use plastic. They decided to start their own campaign. They started a group, Bye Bye Plastic Bags, and posted a petition online calling for a ban on single-use plastic. To their amazement, they quickly collected 6,000 signatures — but it would take them six more years to accomplish their goal. During the campaign, they came to see Bali not as an island paradise but “a paradise lost,” Melati said. The sisters found that the island produced enough plastic waste to fill a 14-story building every day but had no island-wide system for collecting garbage. In December 2017, so much debris washed ashore during trash season that the government declared a “garbage emergency” along some of the most popular tourist beaches. Yet the growth of the tourism industry and the construction of hotels have continued apace. Even President Trump has plans for a Trump-branded hotel and golf resort here. “The land is being overpopulated with buildings, new hotels, building on top of the rice fields,” Melati said. “We lose sight of the traditional way of living here on Bali without respecting enough the culture that we have.” To fulfill their goal of banning single-use plastic, the sisters mobilized young people, organized a petition drive and beach cleanups, persuaded shop owners to go plastic-free and lobbied elected officials. They also started Mountain Mamas, a community of women who make reusable shopping bags from recycled material as an alternative to single-use plastic. Over time, they built up a network of more than three dozen Bye Bye Plastic Bags chapters around the world. In 2016, frustrated by resistance from Bali’s then-governor, I Made Mangku Pastika, they borrowed a page from Gandhi and vowed to go on a hunger strike — albeit a modified strike from sunrise to sunset, given their young ages. Within 24 hours, Mr. Pastika agreed to meet with them. With cameras present, he signed an order banning plastic bags, plastic straws and Styrofoam on the island by 2018. But it was one thing issuing an order and quite another enforcing it. That took continued pressure until the ban finally took effect a year ago under a new governor, I Wayan Koster. Melati said she had hoped that 2020 would be a year of action on the environment, building on growing support among young people for measures to reduce plastic waste and slow climate change. But instead, the coronavirus pandemic has meant learning to organize from home, without the social interaction of meetings and rallies. One focus for Melati has been promoting Youthtopia, an international network aimed at helping young people become change makers. She recently posted a video on how to be an activist from home. “There has been this pause that gives us the space to think about how we move forward,” she said. “What do we decide to do? Are we going to go back to normal because the coronavirus didn’t do its job and make us think? Or are we going to say we understand that there is another way?” Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","Melati and Isabel Wijsen began campaigning to reduce plastic waste in Bali seven years ago. Now 19 and 17, they say the pandemic shows that stark measures to protect the planet are possible."
"Iran Admits Serious Damage to Natanz Nuclear Site, Setting Back Program",2020-07-05,"By Farnaz Fassihi, Richard Pérez-Peña and Ronen Bergman","['A fire at Iran’s main nuclear fuel enrichment site caused significant damage, setting back the country’s nuclear program by months, the government acknowledged on Sunday, after initially saying the destruction was minor. A Middle Eastern intelligence official with knowledge of the episode said Israel was responsible for the attack on the Natanz nuclear complex on Thursday, using a powerful bomb. A member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who was briefed on the matter also said an explosive was used. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing sensitive intelligence and operational topics. Suspicion in Iran has focused on Israel and the United States, which have sabotaged the nuclear program in the past and have vowed to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In the past, Israel and the United States have used cyberattacks to damage Iran’s nuclear program, but that has been ruled out as a cause in this case, the Revolutionary Guards member said. Though there was no way to verify its involvement independently, Israel’s intelligence network has shown its ability to strike in the heart of Iran, breaking into a warehouse in Tehran in 2018 and stealing half a ton of secret records documenting Iran’s nuclear project and spiriting them out of the country. Many of these records were given by Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, to the International Atomic Energy Agency, with many new clues of where Iran might be hiding forbidden equipment and raw material. If the damage at Natanz was an attack by a foreign power, it reinforces Iran’s vulnerability as its economy is strangled by sanctions imposed by a hostile Trump administration and its population is ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic. Tehran is increasingly isolated internationally; even countries that have opposed U.S. action against Iran recently joined in accusing it of hiding nuclear activity from international inspectors. Israeli officials were vague on Sunday when asked about the possibility of involvement in an attack on Natanz, though they stressed the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran. “Everyone can suspect us in everything and all the time, but I don’t think that’s correct,” Defense Minister Benny Gantz said on Sunday in a radio interview with Kan, the state broadcaster. “Not every event that happens in Iran is necessarily related to us,” he added, while not denying involvement in the Natanz explosion. Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, at a conference on Sunday held by the newspapers Maariv and The Jerusalem Post, said, “Iran cannot be allowed to have nuclear capabilities.” To that end, he said, “we take actions that are better left unsaid.” In recent months there have been dozens of episodes, including fires, at industrial complexes in Iran, and those, too, have been widely attributed to Israel. Just since Thursday, explosions occurred at two power plants in Iran, and there was a chlorine gas leak at a chemical plant, all of which the government described as accidents. The previous week, an explosion hit a missile production facility at the Khojir military complex in eastern Tehran, which officials said was caused by a gas tank’s detonating. The Middle Eastern intelligence official who said Israel was responsible for the explosion on Thursday also said it had nothing to do with the other recent incidents. Iranian officials have said publicly that they know what caused the damage at Natanz, but that they are withholding the information for now. Iran is using high-speed centrifuges to process, or enrich, uranium. Uranium enriched to lower levels is used in nuclear reactors, but highly enriched uranium can be fuel for an atomic bomb. Work has been underway at Natanz to build more advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium much more quickly. “It’s possible that this incident will slow down the development and expansion of advanced centrifuges,” Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told the official Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday. “There were advanced equipment and precision measurement devices at this site that were either destroyed or damaged.” He cited “significant financial damage,” and said that the delay could be several months, but that no one was injured. “The damaged warehouse was designed for the final stages of advanced centrifuges and assembly of these machineries,” Mr. Kamalvandi said. While investigators have considered the possibility that Natanz was hit on Thursday by a cruise missile or a drone, they view it as more likely that someone carried a bomb into the building, the Revolutionary Guards member said. They do not yet know how or when the explosives were sneaked in, but the attack clearly demonstrated a hole in the facility’s security, he said. The episode will probably accelerate plans to move more of Iran’s most sensitive facilities underground, he added. Under the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States, China, Russia and European powers, Iran agreed to give up much of its enriched uranium and to limit the level of enrichment and the number of centrifuges it operated. But since President Trump withdrew from the deal and imposed damaging sanctions on Iran, it has ramped up the enrichment program far beyond the limits imposed by the agreement.']",A Middle Eastern intelligence official said Israel planted a bomb in a building where advanced centrifuges were being developed.
An Ancient Valley Lost to ‘Progress’,2020-07-05,By Carlotta Gall and Mauricio Lima,"['In his push for economic development, Turkey’s president has flooded the archaeological gem of Hasankeyf and displaced thousands of families. By Carlotta Gall Photographs by Mauricio Lima HASANKEYF, Turkey — There was something exceptional about Hasankeyf that made visitors fall in love with the town on first sight. Graced with mosques and shrines, it lay nestled beneath great sandstone cliffs on the banks of the River Tigris. Gardens were filled with figs and pomegranates, and vine-covered teahouses hung over the water. The golden cliffs, honeycombed with caves, are thought to have been used in Neolithic times. An ancient fortress marked what was once the edge of the Roman Empire. The ruins of a medieval bridge recalled when the town was a wealthy trading center on the Silk Road. Now it is all lost forever, submerged beneath the rising waters of the Ilisu Dam, the latest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s megaprojects, which flooded 100 miles of the upper Tigris River and its tributaries, including the once-stunning valley. I visited the area repeatedly with the photographer Mauricio Lima for half a year to witness the disappearance of the valley unfold in slow motion. The steadily expanding reservoir displaced more than 70,000 anguished inhabitants. Unexplored archaeological riches were swallowed up along with farms and homes. The waters have rendered Hasankeyf an irretrievable relic of the bygone civilizations that had been similarly drawn to the beauty of the valley, carved over millenniums by one of the Middle East’s greatest rivers. When Mr. Erdogan turned on the first turbine of the hydroelectric dam, celebrating the project’s completion in May, the president had his eye on more immediate concerns, but also on future glories, promising that it would bring peace and prosperity to southeastern Turkey. “The wind of peace, brotherhood and prosperity that will blow from the Ilisu Dam will be felt in these lands for centuries,” he told the ceremony via video link. The dam would contribute billions to the economy and irrigate thousands of hectares of farmland, he said. Government officials have emphasized that hydropower offered their greenest option when they decided to push ahead with the dam a dozen years ago, allowing Turkey to reduce its dependence on imported coal and gas. But many who lost their homes and livelihoods say they were never really consulted. They are bitter and traumatized. Environmentalists and archaeologists, in Turkey and abroad, are angry and frustrated, too, at the loss of the valley and its treasures. Their efforts to save Hasankeyf collapsed in the face of Mr. Erdogan’s increasing authoritarianism. International law, lagging behind the shifting attitudes around climate change and the value of protecting the environment, was inadequate for safeguarding the cultural heritage, they say. Zeynep Ahunbay, a conservation architect, campaigned for more than a decade to save Hasankeyf, not only for its archaeological gems but also for the value of its ancient natural setting. “You see this valley, it is so impressive,” Ms. Ahunbay said, describing what it was like to round the hillside and see Hasankeyf come into view. “You see this river cutting the rock and it goes down and down, and in the end you have the citadel of Hasankeyf. It is really marvelous, and nature and man have formed this place.” “To disturb or change the natural process of the river is also criminal,” she said. “You lose the beauty, you lose history, you lose nature. You are a loser all the time.” When Mr. Erdogan first announced his determination to build the dam, he championed it not only for the energy it would provide Turkey’s expanding economy but also for the development it would bring to the impoverished and insurgency-riven southeast. The dam is part of the massive Southeastern Anatolia Project irrigation plan that was begun in the 1980s. When the plan was first conceived in the 1950s there was little thought of its impact on the environment or on those who would be forced to leave. But as Turkey developed democratically, opponents of the dam began organizing. International activist organizations became involved, too, challenging international investors over concerns about the environmental impact, the loss of cultural heritage and the damage to communities downstream in Iraq and Syria. Ms. Ahunbay did not oppose the dam itself, but campaigned to preserve Hasankeyf and resisted a plan to move the ancient monuments to higher ground and to entomb one in concrete. As president of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, an international professional association that works to protect cultural heritage sites, she and a group of colleagues took the case to the European Court of Human Rights. They lost in the end because none of the plaintiffs were residents of Hasankeyf. The protest campaigns had early success in 2009, pushing several European partners to withdraw financing mainly because Turkey did not meet the requirements of social impact assessments. But Mr. Erdogan was undeterred. He ordered Turkish banks to step in and finance the project instead. Money seemed no object. The government built two new towns to relocate those displaced, and new highways and bridges to skirt the reservoir. Turkish companies, closely allied to Mr. Erdogan’s government, won the building contracts. The project had become a moneymaking exercise, a local bureaucrat said, asking that he not be identified by name for fear of reprisals from the government. “They spent a horrendous amount of money,” said Emin Bulut, a local journalist and activist, who said the bill ran to trillions of lira. “They could have fixed all the problems of the south with that.” In 2012, government officials arrived to begin evaluating property that would be submerged to compensate those who would be displaced. But the money became a source of resentment, dividing the community, and even families, and raising accusations of corruption. The arguments broke apart any unified opposition to the dam. “We surrendered when they came to measure the houses,” said Birsen Argun, 44, who together with her husband ran the Hasbahce Hotel, the only hotel in Hasankeyf, set in a garden of pomegranate and walnut trees along the river. “We brought it upon ourselves.” Her husband tried to persuade his brothers to refuse the money and fight for a bigger payment in the courts but they accepted the payout. People withdrew the money from accounts without telling others, she added. Many of those who did try to organize a protest movement grew up in Hasankeyf, and were even born in the cave homes of the citadel, like Arif Ayhan, 44, who started out selling old coins to tourists and then became a rug dealer. Politics split the campaign, he said, especially when supporters of the outlawed Kurdish movement, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, joined the rallies against the dam, chanting slogans and enraging the police. “This is why we failed,” he said. “We live in the most beautiful place in the world but we could not appreciate the value of this place.” After years of warnings, the end came suddenly. Last August, the government closed the dam gates and released waters from a reservoir upriver. Families scrambled to move out of villages, abandoning homesteads, selling off livestock and even hastily building new houses and access roads on higher ground. “We hoped the water would not come,” said Remziye Nas, mother of four, in the village of Bzere, where the water was lapping below her house. “We did not believe it would be flooded.” In the small town of Temelli, perched above the dam, Hezni Aksu, 60, looked down from his terrace to where his family’s farmhouse and lands were among the first to go under water. “This land was from our ancestors,” he said bitterly. His son was now an unemployed construction worker. “They made migrants of us.” In Hasankeyf, under a heavy police presence, bulldozers demolished the old bazaar one weekend last November. As the ceiling caved in and dust fell in his shop, something snapped inside Mehmet Ali Aslankilic. With a shout he set fire to his belongings in a lone, anguished protest. “It was my uncle’s shop. I had been working there since I was a child,” he said afterward. “Burning my shop was the only way I could deal with this.” A few doors down, Mehmet Nuri Aydin, 42, packed his woven rugs of long sheep’s wool into sacks. “We don’t want to go but we have to,” he said, adding that few shopkeepers could afford the rents in the new town. There was no wider demonstration. Since a failed coup in 2016, Turkey has banned all protests, so the campaign to save Hasankeyf had long since petered out. Activists were even careful about what they posted on social media. Government officials kept photographers away. With the bazaar demolished, families started to load furniture onto trucks and move to specially built homes in the new town. They gathered up the last pomegranates from the trees and piles of firewood, some even wrenching off doors and window frames from their old homes. “Our hearts are burning,” said Celal Ozbey, a retired civil servant as his wife and sons carried out tables and bundles from the house. They had been assigned a house in the new town but he was not sure they would stay, or if economic life would revive. “Time will tell,” he said. Fatime Salkan had refused to leave the low-pitched stone house that belonged to her parents, overlooking the 15th century El-Rizk mosque. Officials warned her to move but she was among several dozen single people who, under a quirk of Turkish law, was not considered eligible for a new home. “They told me to leave many times,” she told me last November. “If an engineer comes, I will say I am going to swim.” She watched from her terrace in December when Dutch engineers lifted the last of the medieval monuments, the 1,700-ton El-Rizk mosque with its intricately carved portal, onto wheels and transported it across the river. They deposited it on a man-made hill beside the new town, where the government has assembled various salvaged monuments and built a modern replica of the medieval bridge. They look out of place on the bare hillside, which will be made into a new archaeological park. Archaeologists insist that monuments ideally should be preserved in their place, but concede that if there is no other option, it is better to save them somehow. For the purists, though, the new Hasankeyf is artificial and charmless. “The real history is down there and we are drowning it,” said Zulku Emer, 41, a master craftsman who was laying a cobbled street beside the new park. “That’s the Turkish way. We ruin something and then try and live in it.”']",
Italy’s Outdoor Summer Movies See Threat From Ailing Film Industry,2020-07-05,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — Since the dawn of cinema, Italy’s torrid summers have made outdoor movie showings under the stars a favorite entertainment choice of the season.  Even the first Venice Film Festival, in August 1932, was held on the terrace of the Hotel Excelsior at the Lido, the island just off the center of Venice. But this year, several nonprofit cultural and social organizations have struggled to get their summer film festivals going after film distributors refused to rent them many requested titles, from the Harry Potter series to “BlacKkKlansman” to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The reason? These nonprofit organizations screen films for free, even as Italy’s fabled film industry is reeling with many theaters closed because of the coronavirus. “We use cinema as an instrument of social cohesion, to try and build community and have a nice time together,” said Luca Sansone of the Laboratorio di Quartiere Giambellino Lorenteggio, a group that shows free films in a Milanese low-income neighborhood “where people don’t go to the movies because it costs too much.” Normally the Milan open air initiative screens 10 films during the summer. This year, it will  show only four, after five distributors for Universal, Warner Bros., Disney, 20th Century Fox and RAI Cinema refused to issue rights to films that Mr. Sansone’s organization had chosen with input from local residents, he said. “The distributors told us that if we show them for free, they can’t give us films,” he said. But those in the business say that the pandemic dealt such a blow that it put the survival of Italy’s film industry at risk, and that giving unfettered free access to films would only make matters worse. “We lost more than 30 million tickets and more than 200 million euros in takings, just in box office receipts,” not to mention the loss of income from food concessions and other revenues, said Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the association of cinema owners who control the country’s 4,000 movie screens. Film industry operators note that the free initiatives receive public funding or have sponsors. The stalemate is the latest chapter in a conflict that started heating up two years ago. It has also affected other groups that screen free films throughout Italy, including one that travels through small central Italian towns struck by recent earthquakes, and a Roman association that began by showing films in the capital’s trendy Trastevere neighborhood and now runs two other venues. Distributors denied so many films to “Piccolo America,” the Roman association, that it was forced to scrap retrospectives featuring the films of Sergio Leone, Kathryn Bigelow and Francis Ford Coppola, said Valerio Carocci, the association’s combative leader. Mr. Carocci and other organizers accuse ANEC, the association of cinema owners, and ANICA, the National Association of Cinema and Audiovisual Industries, of conspiring to undermine the free programming. The accusation triggered an investigation by Italian regulators that became public last month when the police raided offices in Rome. The ongoing investigation seeks to determine whether these associations engaged in anticompetitive behavior, breaching an EU law, or an Italian one. Both ANICA and ANEC have denied any wrongdoing. The clash over summer film is playing out against the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak and its economic ramifications. Like countless other sectors, the film industry and its players, from filmmakers to movie theater owners, have been left gasping ever since Italian cinemas shut their doors on March 8, shortly before the national lockdown. Even though cinema theaters were given the green light to reopen on June 15, only 540 cinemas have reopened under new safety and social distancing guidelines limiting such indoor spaces to 200 people. Many cinema owners say they cannot break even under such rules. The pandemic hit just a year after film industry associations and the culture ministry began promoting year-round movie attendance under the banner “Moviement.”  It worked, Mr. Lorini said: Theaters, traditionally closed during the summer, stayed open. And film attendance went up 45 percent between June and August 2019, boosting the industry’s annual revenues by 14 percent, despite new streaming services entering the Italian market. “We came from a good period of revitalization, and had a good sense of the future,” Mr. Lorini said. Despite subsidies from the Italian government to combat the pandemic’s effects, cinema owners are still struggling. And the organizers of the free summer festivals say they are collateral damage, unable to obtain the titles that they had sought. Mr. Carocci said distributors had denied the rights to more than 150 films that he had asked for. A request for Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” for the Guarimba Film Festival in the Calabrian seaside town of Amantea was one of around 60 titles that the organizers asked for but did not get. “We wanted to bring movies that weren’t so known here,” said Giulio Vita, the chief organizer of the festival. “We’re talking about quality films, not unfair competition.” “No one in Calabria goes to the cinema when it’s 50 degrees Celsius outside,” he added. Though many cinemas are now air-conditioned, traditionally Italians haven’t made them the summer hangout spots that they are in the United States and elsewhere. The distributors accused of denying access have mostly remained mum about the dispute. Representatives of Universal declined to comment. Representatives of Warner Bros. did not respond to request for comment. Representatives for the state broadcaster, Rai Cinema, and its distribution arm said they had granted rights for all films more than three years old. Others in the industry said that costly investments into making films need to be valued, and compensated. “It’s an error to propose culture and cinema at zero cost,” Alessandro Giacobbe, chief executive officer of Academy Two, a Genoa-based distribution company. “Especially this year, when cinemas have been closed for months and the industry in trouble,” he said. “The message that has to pass to the public is that films should not be seen for free, that unless you pay for culture, it will die,” Mr. Giacobbe said.']",A longstanding dispute between film distributors and associations that show outdoor films for free comes to a head as the industry reels from a post-coronavirus downturn.
"Coronavirus Cases in U.S. Are Rising, Even as Death Rates Trend Down",2020-07-03,,"['This briefing has ended. Click here for the latest updates. After a minor late-spring lull, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States is again on the rise. States like Arizona, Florida and Texas are seeing some of their highest numbers to date, and as the nation hurtles deeper into summer, the surge shows few signs of stopping. Yet the virus appears to be killing fewer of the people it infects — a seemingly counterintuitive trend that might not last, experts said. In April and May, Covid-19 led to as many as 3,000 deaths per day and claimed the lives of roughly 7 to 8 percent of Americans known to have been infected. Now, even though cases are rising in the majority of states, some of which are hitting single-day records, the number of daily deaths is closer to 600, and the death rate is less than 5 percent. Because death reports can lag diagnoses by weeks, the current rise in coronavirus cases could portend increases in mortality in the days to come. However, there are also a few factors that can help explain the apparent drop. One is increased diagnostic testing, which has identified many more infected individuals with mild or no symptoms. That means those who die with Covid-19 form a smaller overall proportion of cases, said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security And with more tests available, infections are often identified earlier, “which allows us to intervene earlier,” said Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease expert in Arizona. Health experts also noted that treatments had improved, and that the virus is now infecting more young people, who are less likely to die of Covid-19. Health officials are urging Americans to scale back their Fourth of July plans as the coronavirus pandemic makes a frightening resurgence. Reports of new cases have increased 90 percent in the United States in the last two weeks. More than 53,000 new daily coronavirus cases were reported in the United States on Friday, according to a New York Times database. That total exceeded all previous daily counts but the 55,595 on Thursday, the first time the number had passed 50,000. At least five states set single-day case records on Friday: Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, North Carolina and South Carolina, according to data compiled by The New York Times. In South Carolina, where more than 1,800 new cases were announced Friday, the positivity rate has hovered around 20 percent this week, up from about 10 percent in early June. In Kansas, where at least 770 new cases were announced, daily reporting totals vary widely because the state government only releases new data three times a week. The state reported positivity rates exceeding 10 percent for the first three days in July, a significant uptick from mid-June when the rate hovered between 5 and 7 percent. On Thursday, the United States set a single-day case record for the sixth time in nine days, with more than 55,000 new cases announced, and single-day highs in eight states. Domestic travel restrictions have re-emerged, and many locales have slowed or reversed reopenings. The vast majority of July 4 fireworks displays in big cities and small rural towns have been canceled. Most politicians, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, are forgoing the traditional parades and flag-waving appearances. President Trump, however, has a different, discordant message: The sparkly, booming show must go on at all costs. Mr. Trump was in South Dakota on Friday evening for a massive fireworks display at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, a made-for-TV patriotic display that he has spent years lobbying to revive. (There have been no fireworks at Mount Rushmore since 2009 because of fears that they would set off forest fires and contaminate groundwater.) Few in the packed crowd of supporters wore masks. In his pre-fireworks speech, Mr. Trump barely mentioned the pandemic, which has killed more than 120,000 people in America, instead choosing to cast himself as waging battle against a “new far-left fascism.” Hours before Mr. Trump spoke at Mount Rushmore, law enforcement officials, many holding shields, clashed with protesters blocking a road. As tension escalated, an officer warned demonstrators that they should disperse if they wanted to avoid chemical agents. “It’s not going to be a pleasant smell,” the officer said, according to a video posted on Twitter. “If you don’t mind it, you can stay here, but it’s going to be very irritating.” Anti-Trump protesters chanted and held signs reading, “You are trespassing on stolen land,” and “Black Lives Matter,” according to video footage of the event. A group of Trump supporters held Trump 2020 posters and “All Lives Matter” signs. Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Mr. Trump’s eldest son and a top fund-raising official for the Trump re-election campaign, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday before the event at Mount Rushmore, a person familiar with her condition said. Ms. Guilfoyle traveled to South Dakota with Donald Trump Jr. They did not travel aboard Air Force One, according to the person familiar with her condition, and she was the only person in the group who tested positive. The president plans to follow up his trip with a “Salute to America” celebration the following day on the South Lawn at the White House, including a military flyover and a massive fireworks display on the National Mall that Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, has warned violates local health guidelines. Mr. Trump has consistently downplayed concerns over new cases, claiming that young people “get better much easier and faster” and that the virus will “just disappear.” In many places across the country, face coverings have gone from suggestions to mandates, but Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican, said there were no plans to enforce social distancing during Mr. Trump’s open-air address before a live audience, framed by some of the nation’s most revered presidents. Early in the pandemic, more than 1,000 cases were linked to the Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, which remains one of the country’s largest known clusters. But in recent weeks, South Dakota has had one of the country’s most encouraging trend lines. The state has averaged a few-dozen new cases each day, including 85 announced Friday. There has not been a day with more than 100 new cases in South Dakota since late May. A number of protests are planned for Independence Day in the nation’s capital, ahead of the annual fireworks display and a military flyover hosted by Mr. Trump. Since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the end of May, Washington has become a center of protests. Its mayor, Muriel Bowser, publicly challenged Mr. Trump’s decision to order National Guard troops into the city during demonstrations against racism and police brutality, and she presided over the painting of the words “Black Lives Matter” in giant yellow letters on a street near the White House. Black Lives Matter DC and two other groups, Sunrise and the Black Youth Project 100, announced several events over the weekend focused on defunding the police. The Instagram account #dcteensaction lists at least nine protests for Saturday, including a march near the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and an evening protest beginning in Malcolm X Park. For the official celebration, the federal government said it would provide around 300,000 face coverings, and a news release from the Department of the Interior warned visitors to observe social distancing — while noting that viewing areas on the Mall would be accessible by four security entry points. Ms. Bowser told reporters that she did not think the event was in keeping with federal health officials’ guidelines for gatherings during the pandemic. The holiday comes amid a national reckoning over racism, and the founding story of the United States is part of what is being questioned right now. William H. Lamar IV, the pastor of the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, a few blocks from the White House, said that he did not normally celebrate the Fourth but that this year  the country might be observing the holiday with more honesty than usual. “The symbols coming down, that’s only the beginning,” Reverend Lamar said. “That’s people saying, ‘We need a new story. This story excludes me. It is inherently violent and evil. It murdered me. It erased me as a human being. I deserve a story that includes me and wants me to flourish.’” He added: “Is there a kind of national story that can hold us together in this multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious reality? The survival of this experiment called America depends upon it.” Brazil, which has more coronavirus cases than any country but the United States, topped 1.5 million total infections on Friday, just two weeks after reaching a million cases, according to a New York Times database. But even as the country passed that grim milestone, President Jair Bolsonaro vetoed a measure that would have provided masks to vulnerable groups and required businesses to provide masks to their employees, according to The Associated Press. Since mid-June, some major cities in Brazil have eased preventive measures. Shopping malls have already reopened in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Beaches are starting to draw crowds again. And Rio allowed gyms and bars to reopen at 50 percent capacity on Thursday, while some hospital systems were close to running out of intensive care beds. If the country’s trend lines hold, some epidemiologists project the pandemic’s death toll in Brazil could surpass that of the U.S. by late July. Brazil had recorded 63,174 total deaths as of Friday; the U.S. has recorded 129,402. Some experts initially thought that Brazil was well equipped to cope with the pandemic, based on its track record during past public health emergencies. Brazil has a public health care system that, while underfunded, provides robust coverage across the country. Global roundup Starting July 10, England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of America. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in easing restrictions. The European Union recently upheld a ban on U.S. travelers, even as it opened its borders to visitors from Canada, Rwanda, Thailand and 15 other countries. England’s policy, announced on Friday, is less restrictive: Americans can still enter so long as they agree to isolate themselves for two weeks. The United States has barred most visitors from Britain since March, after briefly exempting them from a travel ban on the European Union. At the time, Europe was dealing with far more coronavirus infections than the United States. Since then, the epicenter of the pandemic has moved across the Atlantic. However, Britain still has the world’s third-highest known death toll, with triple-digit death counts still coming most days. More than half the country’s nursing homes have had at least one case since March. The government announced on Friday that nursing home residents will be tested for the virus monthly, while staff members will receive tests weekly, officials announced. Some public-health experts said the fractious debate over the travel quarantine had distracted from more pressing problems, like safely reopening Britain’s schools and organizing an effective test-and-trace program. “The U.K. government seems focused on giving people a summer pandemic holiday instead of dealing with the hard issues facing the aviation industry for the coming year,” said Professor Devi Sridhar, the director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said earlier this week that it was Britons’ “patriotic duty” to go to the pub when they reopen at 6 a.m. on Saturday, has now urged people not to “overdo it.” His warning came after tens of thousands have flocked to beaches, organized illegal music parties and violated social-distancing rules in recent weeks. “Let’s not blow it now, folks,” Mr. Johnson told LBC radio on Friday, weeks after he announced that the country’s “long hibernation” was over and that the virus was under control. In other news: Brazil, which has been experiencing a surge in virus cases, allowed restaurants and bars to reopen with conditions on Thursday, according to The Associated Press. Gyms, dance, fighting and swimming classes were also authorized to restart, The A.P. said, as long as there is no physical contact, a third of capacity and a time-slot schedule. Seeking to give his government a fresh start after the pandemic battered the nation, President Emmanuel Macron of France shuffled prime ministers on Friday, trading in the popular incumbent, Édouard Philippe, for a relatively unknown functionary who helped guide the country out of the health emergency, Jean Castex. Mr. Philippe is one of three government officials facing investigation into their handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to French prosecutors. Air France, which like other airlines has seen ticket sales plummet, told labor union leaders on Friday that it needs to cut about 7,500 jobs by the end of 2022, but that it would achieve the most through attrition and would also offer buyouts, early retirement packages and assistance with applying for open positions at the company. The airline has received 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) from the French government. Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose successful response to the coronavirus crisis in Germany has been widely praised, was seen wearing a mask for the first time on Friday, as she headed into a session at the cramped Bundesrat. Asked by a reporter this week why she didn’t mask, even as she encourages Germans to, she said: “If I keep the social distancing rules, then I don’t need to wear a mask. And when I don’t social distance, when I go shopping for example, we clearly never run into each other.” Spain said on Friday that it would not reopen its borders with Morocco after Morocco’s decision to keep entry points closed that are used by millions of people every summer. The dispute also affects Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in North Africa. Spain also said that it would bar arrivals from Algeria and China. The European Union reopened its borders this week to travelers from 15 countries, including Algeria, while travelers from China would be permitted if China reciprocates. Austria recorded more than 100 new cases of the virus on a single day this week, its highest such total in more than two months. Many of the confirmed infections are connected to a religious community in Linz, a city in the northern part of the country, and officials closed schools and day care centers in the area for a week. Austria’s health ministry has registered 17,959 cases and 705 deaths. Spending two weeks quarantined in a hotel room is not a pleasant experience, as thousands of people who’ve flown internationally since the pandemic began can attest. But the 300 foreigners confined to a Ramada hotel in Yongin, South Korea, have it worse than most. Each day for the past week, from about 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., protesters outside the hotel have been raising a deafening noise with drums, brass gongs and loudspeakers blaring music. They are local residents, angry that the government chose a hotel in their neighborhood as a quarantine site. “Even with double-glazed windows, they can still be heard when the windows are closed,” said James Martin Thompson, an app developer from Washington, from his fifth-floor room in the hotel, the Ramada by Wyndham Yongin. “When you’re stuck in a small indoor space 24/7, being able to open the windows makes it much more bearable,” said Mr. Thompson. “And during much of the daytime, that isn’t practical with the noise coming from the demonstrators.” On June 11, the South Korean government designated the Ramada as one of eight facilities where foreigners who arrive with no Covid-19 symptoms are quarantined for two weeks. Three days later, a foreigner quarantined at the hotel tested positive for the coronavirus. Since then, residents of the neighborhood, called Jeondae-ri, have been accusing the government of recklessly exposing them to infection. On June 27, protesters began their daily noise-making campaign in front of the 18-story hotel, hoping to force the authorities to send foreigners elsewhere for quarantine. A large banner that protesters hung in front of the Ramada read, “This is a hotel that produced a confirmed Covid-19 case. Shut it down immediately!” The foreigners are confined to their rooms with little hope of escaping the torment, even if they wanted to try. Vice President Mike Pence changed his travel plans in Arizona after Secret Service agents set to accompany with him tested positive or showed symptoms, two administration officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according to a person familiar with Mr. Pence’s travel. A swift rise in new cases in the state has overwhelmed testing centers in recent days, and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, ordered bars, gyms and movie theaters closed this week. As of Friday, there have been more than 4,300 new cases reported in the state. In an apparent acknowledgment of outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the vice president canceled his plan to headline a “Faith in America” campaign rally in Tucson on Tuesday and then tour Yuma with Mr. Ducey. Instead, Mr. Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor International Airport. “Help is on the way,” Mr. Pence said at a news conference with Mr. Ducey at the airport, after descending the steps of Air Force Two wearing a mask, the latest sign of the administration’s evolving stance on face coverings. But the positive tests and symptoms of Secret Service agents expected to be in proximity to the man who is next in line for the presidency were some of the factors that prompted his change of schedule, the officials said. The news of the agents who showed symptoms, or tested positive, was first reported by The Washington Post. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence did not respond to a request for comment. The latest illnesses among the small circle of individuals who interact directly with the vice president were a reminder of the dangers of carrying on with campaign and official government travel as the pandemic rages on. President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras has been discharged from the hospital after receiving more than two weeks of inpatient treatment for Covid-19 and related pneumonia. He was admitted on June 17, hours after he tested positive for the illness. His wife, Ana García, also tested positive, but convalesced at home. “My commitment to Honduras is stronger than ever,” Mr. Hernández said on Twitter, announcing his release on Thursday. “To work!” Officials said he would continue his recuperation in isolation at home. Honduras, like many other countries in Latin America, is struggling to contain the spread of the virus. As of Friday, more than 21,000 cases had been confirmed in Honduras, along with more than 590 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared Latin America the center of the pandemic, and several countries in the region are now suffering some of the world’s worst outbreaks. The organization’s regional director for the Americas, Carissa Etienne, warned this week that the death toll from Covid-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean could roughly quadruple by October to more than 438,000. U.S. Roundup As case counts continued to hit record highs in many states, local officials released new guidance, creating a patchwork system for Americans planning to celebrate the holiday weekend. As many as 80 percent of community fireworks displays in large cities and small rural towns have been canceled this year over fears that they would create a social distancing nightmare. In New York City, instead of the usual hourlong fireworks extravaganza, Macy’s will have five-minute displays in undisclosed locations across the five boroughs. The grand finale on Saturday, which will also be from an undisclosed location, will be televised. In Florida, Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. And on Friday, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez’s countywide curfew, which was announced Thursday, went into effect from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Mr. Giménez also rolled back the opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their reopening plans approved by the county. Florida reported more than 9,400 new cases Friday. Exactly one month earlier, the state reported just 1,317 new cases. In Mississippi, which reported more than 900 new coronavirus cases Friday — the second-highest single day total recorded by the state — Gov. Tate Reeves’s executive orders will allow indoor gatherings of up to 20 people. Bars and restaurants can offer indoor dining as long as they stay below 50 percent capacity. Backyard BBQs can have up to 100 people so long as guests remain socially distanced. And outdoor stadiums will also be allowed to remain open at 25 percent capacity, potentially allowing thousands to gather at a single event. And in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott reversed course on Thursday, ordering residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. Texas has been one of the worst-hit states in the past week reaching a record number of hospitalizations on Friday, up 270 to 7,652, and reporting more than 6,400 new cases. Elsewhere in the U.S.: In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an executive order allowing local officials to pass mask ordinances on Friday. Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, never implemented a statewide stay-at-home order, instead opting to close high-contact businesses like gyms and personal care services. More than 540 new cases were announced in the state on Friday, just a day after a record 878 cases were reported, according to a New York Times database. Critics of Amtrak’s newly announced cutbacks worry that the rail agency will not bring back service to the long-distance routes it has long sought to end. With ridership down 95 percent and revenue plummeting, Amtrak plans to cut up to 20 percent of its work force by October and suspend daily service on routes that service over 220 communities. Amtrak has received letters from 16 senators asking why it needed to enact such steep cuts since it had already received $1 billion in emergency aid. Results of Major League Baseball’s first round of widespread coronavirus testing were released on Friday, as preseason training resumed in full after being shut down for more than three months. Out of 3,185 tests, 38 were positive (31 players and seven staff members). The league plans to open a 60-game season on July 23, with no fans in the stands. Preseason preparation has resumed at teams’ home stadiums rather than returning to spring-training sites in Florida and Arizona. In New York Times/Siena College surveys of voters in battleground states for the presidential election, supporters of Joseph R. Biden Jr. were far more likely than President Trump’s to be concerned about in-person voting during the pandemic. About 40 percent of Mr. Biden’s supporters said they would feel uncomfortable, compared with just 6 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters. Most of these people said they would go to the polls anyway, but 8 percent of Mr. Biden’s surveyed supporters and less than 2 percent of Mr. Trump’s said they would be too uncomfortable to go vote. Voting by mail for any reason is available in all six battleground states included in the Times/Siena data. Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said Thursday that travelers from 15 states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two weeks or face up to $7,000 in fines. Some 13,400 employees, or nearly 70 percent of the staffing, of Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles U.S. visas and naturalization, face furlough by Aug. 3 because the immigration processing fees that fund it have plummeted The SAG-AFTRA actors’ union issued a do-not-work notice to its members for a pandemic-themed independent film starring Demi Moore and Craig Robinson, saying that producers had “not been transparent about their safety protocols.” Producers for the film, “Songbird,” include Michael Bay, who is better known for his work on big-budget films, and Adam Goodman, a former president of production at Paramount Pictures. “Songbird” has drawn attention as one of the first movies aiming to roll cameras since the virus brought production in Hollywood to a halt in March. California allowed film and television shoots to resume on June 12 — under strict safety protocols — and Los Angeles began issuing permits last week. So far, however, only a handful of TV shows (mostly soap operas like “The Bold and the Beautiful”) have restarted production; none of the major movie studios are expected to shoot anything before next month. The independent companies behind “Songbird” have said they planned to use nontraditional camera techniques to avoid having actors in proximity. The film, a thriller, takes place in the near future during a pandemic lockdown — martial law has been imposed to combat a fast-mutating virus — and focuses on a young woman and a motorbike courier with rare immunity. Representatives for the producers either declined to comment or did not respond to a query. Invisible Narratives, one of the companies involved, told Deadline, an entertainment trade news site, that it was “actively working to resolve this paperwork issue.” Leaders in many states are urging people to stay at home this holiday weekend. Here are some safe ideas for enjoying the Fourth of July holiday. College students across the country have been warned that campus life will look dramatically different in the fall, with temperature checks at academic buildings, masks in half-empty lecture halls and maybe no football games. What they might not expect: a lack of professors in the classroom. Thousands of instructors at American colleges and universities have told administrators in recent days that they are unwilling to resume in-person classes because of the pandemic. More than three-quarters of colleges and universities have decided students can return to campus this fall. But they face a growing faculty revolt. “Until there’s a vaccine, I’m not setting foot on campus,” said Dana Ward, 70, an emeritus professor of political studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who teaches a class in anarchist history and thought. “Going into the classroom is like playing Russian roulette.” This comes as major outbreaks have hit college towns this summer, spread by partying students and practicing athletes. In Pennsylvania, a Penn State student living off campus has died of respiratory failure and Covid-19, the first known death of a student at the university related to the virus, according to the university. The student, Juan Garcia, 21, who was in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, had been living off-campus in State College when he began to feel sick, the university said in an announcement expressing its condolences. He went home to Allentown on June 19, and tested positive for the coronavirus the next day. He died on June 30, the university said. The death comes as faculty, concerned about their own safety and that of students, are organizing to have more say in the campus opening for the fall. Sarah J. Townsend, an associate professor of Spanish and Portuguese and a faculty organizer, said the student’s death was disturbing in part because of the close connection between the campus and the surrounding town. In an indication of how fluid the situation is, the University of Southern California said on Wednesday that an “alarming spike” in coronavirus cases had prompted it to reverse an earlier decision to encourage attending classes in person. With more than a month before campuses start reopening, it is hard to predict how many professors will refuse to teach face-to-face classes in the fall. But colleges and professors are planning ahead. U.S. Roundup New York, transformed by the virus and protests for racial justice, has been cooped up, and a good, old-fashioned swim “takes the edge off,” said Rachel Thompson, a schoolteacher. She was at Rockaway Beach in Queens on Wednesday as New York City opened its beaches for swimming — just in time for the Fourth of July weekend, when even more people are expected to pack the sand. Still, several beachgoers that morning, Ms. Thompson included, were feeling a bit jittery about the city’s gradual reopening. An hour after the ban on swimming was lifted, the mayor announced that indoor dining at restaurants would not resume on Monday as anticipated, citing the virus’s rapid spread in other large states. Mayor Bill de Blasio, worried that large crowds might risk virus transmission, had kept the city’s 14 miles of beaches closed even as temperatures rose — along with frustration from long-quarantined New Yorkers. With an estimated million visitors total on a hot day, they are some of the country’s most crowded shorelines, and people largely access them via subways and buses. Safety measures include lifeguards in masks carrying waist packs with a face mask, gloves and hand sanitizer. Beachgoers must keep at least six feet apart and wear face coverings when on the sand or the boardwalk. Restrooms will operate at half-capacity, and boardwalk concessions must offer to-go service only. Hundreds of city workers, deployed as social distancing ambassadors, will hand out masks, keep space between beachgoers, tally beachgoers to prevent overcrowding, tend beach entrances to limit capacity and, if necessary, direct people to less crowded sections. Worries have lingered about a possible backslide in the state, where, after reining in the virus, there have been a few alarming outbreaks, such those at a house party and graduation party in the suburbs just north of the city. Elsewhere in the U.S.: In Miami-Dade County, Fla., the mayor imposed a countywide curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., starting Friday; he also rolled back the opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their reopening plans approved by the county. Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. On Friday, Florida reported 9,488 new cases. Critics of Amtrak’s newly announced cutbacks worry that the rail agency will not bring back service to the long-distance routes it has long sought to end. With ridership down 95 percent and revenue plummeting, Amtrak plans to cut up to 20 percent of its work force by October and suspend daily service on routes that service over 220 communities.

Voting by mail for any reason is available in all six battleground states included in the Times/Siena data. Texas, one of the worst-hit states in the past week, saw a record number of hospitalizations on Friday, up 270 to 7,652. In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said Thursday that travelers from 15 states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two weeks or face up to $7,000 in fines. Some 13,400 employees, or nearly 70 percent of the staffing, of Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles U.S. visas and naturalization, face furlough by Aug. 3 because the immigration processing fees that fund it have plummeted.

More than 540 new cases were announced in the state on Friday, just a day after a record 878 cases were reported, according to a New York Times database. Identifying likely voters is a challenge for pollsters in every election. This year, the coronavirus, mail voting and a surge in political engagement may make it even harder than usual. For now, Mr. Biden’s nine-point lead across the critical battleground states is so significant that it is essentially invulnerable to assumptions about turnout, according to New York Times/Siena College surveys of the states likeliest to decide the election. But supporters of Mr. Biden are far more likely to be concerned about in-person voting during the pandemic, and his wide polling lead among registered voters could narrow if their concerns persist to the election. Over all, one-quarter of registered voters in the battleground states said they would feel uncomfortable voting in person. People were asked if they would feel uncomfortable voting in person if the election were held during the week they were interviewed in June. About 40 percent of Mr. Biden’s supporters said they would feel uncomfortable, compared with just 6 percent of President Trump’s supporters. This political divide transcends demographics. A young Biden supporter in a rural area, for instance, would be likelier to feel uncomfortable voting than an older Trump supporter in a city, even though the health risk is probably quite low for the Biden voter and potentially quite significant for the Trump supporter. Most of these voters would go to the polls anyway. But about one-quarter of the uncomfortable voters — or about 6 percent of the overall electorate — said they would feel too uncomfortable to vote in person if the election were held during the week they were interviewed. This includes 8 percent of all of Mr. Biden’s supporters in the battleground states, compared with fewer than 2 percent of Mr. Trump’s supporters. It is important to emphasize that no-excuse absentee voting, in which any voter can request a mail ballot, is available in all six of the battleground states included in the Times/Siena data. On Thursday, the Supreme Court blocked a trial judge’s order that would have made it easier for voters in three Alabama counties to use absentee ballots in this month’s primary runoff election. The court’s brief, unsigned order gave no reasons, which is typical when it rules on emergency applications, and it said the order would remain in effect while appeals moved forward. The court’s four more liberal members — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — said they would have rejected Alabama’s request. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, who said earlier this week that it was Britons’ “patriotic duty” to go to the pub when they reopen on Saturday, has now urged people not to “overdo it.” His warning came after tens of thousands have flocked to beaches, organized illegal music parties and violated social-distancing rules in recent weeks. Britain has reported the world’s third-highest pandemic death toll, with triple-digit death counts still coming most days. “Let’s not blow it now, folks,” Mr. Johnson told LBC radio on Friday, weeks after he announced that the country’s “long hibernation” was over and that the virus was under control. Restaurant industry workers have said in British news outlets that they were afraid of going back to work, and concerns are high that pub customers could flout basic rules and trigger new waves of infections. A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said that pubs could reopen starting at 6 a.m. on Saturday, “in the event anybody would attempt to try to open at midnight.” On Wednesday, the Treasury tweeted that people should “grab a drink and raise a glass” when pubs reopen. The tweet was later deleted. A pub in south London has promised “endless supply” of drinks to “fuel your shenanigans,” after more than three months of closure, which was a first in the history of the country’s pubs. Pubs — like restaurants, hair salons and other businesses welcoming visitors again on Saturday — will have to maintain a 21-day record of their customers, the government has said, to trace contacts in case of new outbreaks. In Leicester, 100 miles north of London, pubs and other nonessential businesses will remain closed because of a regional outbreak of virus cases. The British authorities also announced on Friday that, starting July 10, travelers from countries in Europe including France, Italy and Spain will no longer have to self-quarantine for 14 days. The change will currently only apply to England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland expected to set up their own rules. Starting July 10, England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of America. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in easing restrictions. Residents in nursing homes in Britain will be tested for the virus monthly, while staff members will receive tests weekly, officials announced. According to a survey published on Friday by the Office for National Statistics, 56 percent of the country’s nursing homes have had at least one case since March, with 20 percent of residents in such facilities known to have been infected. Out of the nearly 44,000 reported deaths in Britain, at least 15,500 people have died in nursing homes. China appears to be downplaying expectations ahead of a planned trip next week by a World Health Organization team to the country to investigate the origins of the outbreak. Since the head of the W.H.O., Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced the trip on Monday, several Chinese officials and experts have said that any investigation into the origins of the virus should not focus only on China. “It does not matter which country the scientific identification work starts with, as long as it involves all related countries and is fairly conducted,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run nationalist newspaper Global Times on Tuesday. Wang Guangfa, a top government health adviser, told Global Times this week that the W.H.O. should also go to Spain. He cited a not-yet-published study by researchers at the University of Barcelona that suggests the virus was present in Spain’s wastewater as early as March 2019. Independent experts have said the study was flawed, and that other lines of evidence strongly suggest the virus emerged in China late last year. The virus most likely originated in bats, but the path of transmission is still unknown. Experts say establishing that will be a crucial step in preventing future outbreaks. The hunt for information has focused on Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus is believed to have first emerged, and specifically the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was said to have sold wildlife and had links to many of the country’s first reported cases. Mike Ryan, head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program, said on Wednesday that the agency would be sending two experts from Geneva to join its China team on next week’s trip. He said one would likely be an epidemiologist and the other an expert in animal health. Dr. Ryan did not reveal which cities the team was planning to visit. He described it as a “scoping mission.” Getting answers on the origins of the virus has become more difficult as the issue has become increasingly politicized. China has been on the defensive for months in response to growing criticism from the United States and other countries for its initial mishandling of the outbreak. Officials from both the United States and China have, without providing evidence, accused each other of intentionally releasing the virus. But at a news briefing this week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman sounded a less-aggressive note. “China has always believed that virus tracing is a scientific issue, and relevant research should be carried out by scientists and medical experts,” said Zhao Lijian, the spokesman, who in March promoted a theory that the U.S. Army purposely introduced the virus to China. “China continues to support scientists from all over the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and spread of viruses,” he added. In Columbia, Mo., where coronavirus case numbers are as high as they’ve ever been, contact tracers are overwhelmed. Around Seattle, where a surge is underway, officials warned that social distancing was waning. And in Flint, Mich., where there are worrisome signs after weeks of improvement, the mayor said the city would crack down on late-night parties that have drawn hundreds of young people. “Someday we will welcome these crowds to our great city,” Flint’s mayor, Sheldon Neeley, said. “Now is not the time.” As the pandemic spirals further out of control in the United States, politicians and public health officials have become noticeably more stern. New cases reported have increased 90 percent in the United States in the last two weeks. On Thursday, the U.S. also set a single-day case record for the sixth time in nine days, with more than 55,000 new cases announced, and single-day highs in eight states. In many places, face coverings have gone from suggestions to mandates. Bars have been reopened — and closed again. Domestic travel restrictions have re-emerged. And mayors have told people to shape up and follow the rules. “I know that wearing a mask is uncomfortable,” said Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, where case numbers are spiking and face coverings are now required. “I know that, unfortunately, wearing a mask has become a political flash point. But I also know that masks save lives.” In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, one of the worst-hit states in the past week, on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Thursday that travelers from 15 states with large outbreaks would have to quarantine for two weeks or face up to $7,000 in fines. In Los Angeles County, Calif., where there are more than 2,000 new cases most days, the top public health official said “we urgently need to make a change in the trajectory.” And in Northern California, where the outlook is also bad, leaders in several counties urged residents to celebrate the Fourth of July at home and not test the limits of the law. “Just because you can does not mean it is safe or that you should rush to do it,” said Dr. Matt Willis, the Marin County public health officer. President Trump plans to celebrate the Independence Day holiday with a fireworks display on Friday at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota. About 7,500 people are expected to attend the outdoor event, where masks will be available but not required. As the United States headed into the Fourth of July weekend, officials were telling people to hold the partying until next year. The coronavirus has exploded in large parts of the nation: On Thursday, the U.S. set a single-day case record for the sixth time in nine days, with more than 50,000 new cases reported for the first time, according to a New York Times database. The figure topped 55,000 by the end of the day. Thursday’s daily new case total represented an increase of more than 85 percent since two weeks ago, when states were reopening after extensive lockdowns tempered the outbreak, particularly in the hard-hit Northeast. Until last week, the country had not surpassed a record daily total for two months, since 36,738 new cases were reported on April 24. In a reversal, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, one of the worst-hit states in the past week, on Thursday ordered residents in counties with 20 or more virus cases to wear masks in public. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had previously opposed attempts by Democratic mayors and other local officials to require everyone in their cities to wear masks in public. But as the number of cases increased in recent weeks, he cleared the way for local authorities to require masks in businesses, before imposing the more aggressive statewide requirement. Vice President Mike Pence changed a planned trip this week to Arizona after Secret Service agents set to travel with him tested positive for the coronavirus or showed symptoms, two administration officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according to a person familiar with Mr. Pence’s travel. A swift rise in new cases in the state had overwhelmed testing centers in recent days, and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, ordered bars, gyms and movie theaters closed this week. In an apparent acknowledgment of outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the vice president canceled his plan to headline a “Faith in America” campaign rally in Tucson on Tuesday and then to tour Yuma with Mr. Ducey. Instead, Mr. Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor International Airport. At least eight states reported single-day case records on Thursday: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Tennessee. Only a dozen states, mostly in the Northeast, have managed to keep new case levels flat or declining. In Florida, Mayor Carlos A. Giménez of Miami-Dade County imposed a countywide curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., starting Friday. Miami-Dade and Broward counties had already announced they were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. “This is one of various actions I’m pursuing to tamp down this spike of Covid-19 and protect our residents,” Mr. Giménez said. He is also rolling back the opening of movie theaters, arcades, casinos, concert halls, bowling halls and adult entertainment venues that recently had their reopening plans approved by the county.

"In North Korea, Coronavirus Hurts More Than Any Sanctions Could",2020-07-04,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — On New Year’s Day, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called for a “frontal breakthrough to foil the enemies’ sanctions.” The strategy meant finding new sources of income, legal or illegal, and mainly from China. Sending North Korean workers to China. Bringing more tourists from there. Smuggling banned cargo, like coal or oil, across the border at night or between ships on high seas. But there was one thing Mr. Kim did not foresee: the coronavirus. Barely three weeks after Mr. Kim unveiled his New Year’s resolution, North Korea shut down \u200bits border with China to protect itself against the emerging outbreak in the city of Wuhan. It was no ordinary border\u200b closure. China accounted for 95 percent of the North’s trade. Consumer goods, raw materials, fuel and machine parts smuggled into the North across their 870-mile border kept North Korean markets and factories sputtering along, despite United Nations sanctions designed to curb the Kim regime’s nuclear ambitions. With the border sealed, the North’s official exports to China, already hobbled by the sanctions, have crashed even further. In March, they were worth just $610,000, according to Chinese customs data — down 96 percent from a year earlier. The North’s newly opened ski and spa resorts are empty of Chinese tourists, and its smuggling ships sit idle in their ports. The virus has isolated the North Korean economy as no sanctions could. It has devastated the regime’s ability to bring in money through legal and illegal trade, leaving it scrambling to protect the country’s diminishing foreign currency reserves. “To North Korea, Covid-19 is a black swan, none of its policymakers saw it coming,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.  \u200bNorth Korea claims it has had no coronavirus cases. But it was one of the first countries to shut its border, aware that its woefully underequipped public health system made it particularly vulnerable to mass infection. The pandemic could hardly have come at a worse time for Mr. Kim, whose attempts to win sanctions relief in talks with President Trump have been fruitless. North Korea’s recent acts of hostility toward South Korea, including the destruction of the inter-Korean liaison office in the North, have been seen in part as acts of economic desperation. “If you peel North Korea’s problem like an onion, at the core is its economy, and its economic trouble comes down to whether it can lift sanctions,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. The North Korean economy has languished for decades, hobbled by communist mismanagement, a famine in the late 1990s and the gradually tougher sanctions imposed by the United Nations since 2006, when the North carried out its first nuclear test. Mr. Kim has tried to boost the economy with domestic reforms, aimed at creating a “socialist system of responsible business operation.” Factories and collective farms were given more incentives to increase productivity, including the right to keep surpluses. Mr. Kim also ramped up exports of coal, iron ore, textiles and seafood to China, achieving economic growth of 3.9 percent in 2016, the highest since the late 1990s, according to South Korea’s central bank. But the North also rapidly expanded \u200bits weapons \u200bprograms, testing three intercontinental ballistic missiles in 2017, as well as what it said was a hydrogen bomb. In response, the United Nations Security Council tightened the noose around the North’s economy by banning all of its major exports.\u200b The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 2017. It contracted by 4.1 percent the following year, with its exports to China plummeting 86 percent.  By February 2019, when Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump held their second summit meeting, in Vietnam, the North Korean leader was desperate \u200bfor relief\u200b. The Security Council had required China, Russia and other countries to expel all North Korean workers by \u200bDecember, which threatened to deprive the North of another key source of income, estimated at $500 million to $1 billion a year. But Mr. Kim’s hopes of easing the sanctions ended when the Vietnam talks collapsed. In his \u200bgrim New Year’s message\u200b, Mr. Kim seemed determined to slog through the sanctions, asking North Koreans to prepare to “tighten our belts” again. He also vowed to boost his nuclear weapons program further, hoping that a more advanced nuclear arsenal would give him more leverage with Mr. Trump or his successor. He threatened to end his moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, warning that \u200bthe world would soon witness \u200bhis “new strategic weapon\u200b.” State-run television echoed that sentiment later in January, in a broadcast about Mr. Kim’s brief meeting with Mr. Trump last summer on the inter-Korean border. “We don’t intend to sell our pride and national power for some spectacular economic transformation,” Mr. Kim was quoted as telling Mr. Trump, after the American leader promised the North a better economic future if it gave up its nuclear weapons first.  At the time, Mr. Kim had reason to be so defiant. After hitting bottom in 2018, his country’s trade with China grew 15 percent last year, according to data compiled by the Korea International Trade Association. It exported practically anything not banned by United Nations sanctions: cheap watches assembled with Chinese components; artificial eyelashes; wigs, mannequins, soccer balls and tungsten. China also sent more tourists to the North after Mr. Kim’s third summit meeting with its leader, Xi Jinping, in June 2018. Tourism was one North Korean industry that had not been affected by the sanctions, and Mr. Kim has been busy building massive new resort towns. The North also continued to circumvent the sanctions. Last year, it exported $370 million worth of coal in illicit ship-to-ship transfers to Chinese barges, according to the United Nations. And despite the ban on work permits for North Koreans, China allowed many to be employed on short-term tourist or student visas, according to analysts and news reports\u200b in South Korea\u200b. But the trade imbalance with China created its own concerns. Even as the sanctions hit the North’s exports hard, the country continued to buy cooking oil, flour, sugar and other consumer goods, as well as construction materials, from China. The imports were needed to keep its industries going, as well as the unofficial markets that have helped many people to survive, as the North’s food rationing system fails to meet the population’s needs. Since 2017, North Korea has reported a trade deficit of more than $2 billion every year. In comparison, the North’s total exports last year were $260 million.\u200b “The clock is ticking and the bomb could explode any time,” Kim Byung-yeon, a\u200b Seoul National University\u200b economist\u200b, wrote in December, predicting that the North’s foreign currency reserves would shrink by $1 billion a year, leading inexorably to a crisis. North Korea has tried to replenish its coffers with revenues from illegal smuggling and cybertheft, as well as “loyalty donations” from \u200bwhat are known as donju — tradespeople with political connections, who have hoarded foreign currency obtained through smuggling\u200b and other enterprises. Mr. Kim’s government also runs shops in Pyongyang, the capital, where the moneyed class spends foreign currency on imported goods. And it has profited by selling Chinese smartphones to an estimated six million cellphone subscribers in the country. “The debate has been about how quickly or slowly the North’s foreign currency would diminish,” Mr. Go said. “But there is no doubt now that Covid-19 has accelerated the speed.” \u200bRecently, signs have emerged of growing stress on the North’s economy, especially its foreign currency reserves. The government recently issued public bonds for the first time in 17 years, reported Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that uses informants inside \u200bthe \u200bNorth. Mr. Kim tested the elites’ loyalty by asking them to buy bonds with foreign currency, it said. The authorities have also cracked down harder on the use of foreign currency in markets in an effort to shore up the won, the local currency, said Jiro Ishimaru, a chief editor at Asia Press International in Japan, who has monitored the North Korean economy for years with the help of correspondents there. To save on foreign currency, \u200bMr. Kim has encouraged his people to produce more goods at home, like snacks, cosmetics and beverages. But Covid-19 has hit those sectors as well, because they depended on Chinese raw materials to produce the goods. “Kim Jong-un thought he could survive with tourism revenues, smuggling and Chinese help,\u200b but his plans have crumbled because of the coronavirus,” said Mr. Ishimaru\u200b. “If the virus has taught him anything, it is how dependent his economy is on China.”']","Closing the border with China crippled the regime’s few remaining methods, legal and otherwise, for bringing in much-needed foreign currency."
Boris Johnson’s ‘Global Britain’: Inspired Vision or Wishful Thinking?,2020-07-03,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his pro-Brexit allies have long promised that once Britain broke free of the European Union, it could play a bold new role on the world stage — one they dubbed Global Britain. For a few days this week, it looked as if they were actually making good on that promise. When China imposed a new security law on Hong Kong, Mr. Johnson not only condemned the Chinese government, he also threw open Britain’s doors to nearly three million residents of the former British colony who were eligible for residency in Britain. It was a strong, some even said brave, stand by a long-departed colonial government against the oppression of a rising superpower. But it was, in the end, also a signpost of Britain’s diminished stature: The Chinese threatened retaliation, while Mr. Johnson’s ministers admitted that there was nothing they could do if China refused to allow those people to leave Hong Kong. “We’re a medium-size power that needs to work with others to secure what we want around the world,” said Chris Patten, who served as the last British governor of Hong Kong. Leaving the European Union, he said, had deprived Britain of its most natural partner “in trying to deal with these global issues.” The clash with China laid bare deeper contradictions in Mr. Johnson’s post-Brexit vision: Britain wants to go global at a time when globalization is in retreat. It has cast off from the world’s largest trading bloc when the world is more divided than ever into competing regions. And it is trying to carve out an overseas role just as the coronavirus pandemic has crippled its domestic economy. Mr. Johnson’s model is no longer Winston Churchill, the proud symbol of Britain’s imperial reach, but Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal put American society back on its feet after the Great Depression. With millions of Britons facing joblessness and a mammoth rebuilding project at home, Mr. Johnson’s government scarcely has the bandwidth to reestablish Britain as an energetic player on the global stage. His ministers no longer invoke the phrase Singapore-on-Thames, which once described the kind of agile, lightly regulated, free-trading powerhouse that they envisioned emerging from Brexit. Moreover, the geopolitical landscape has shifted significantly since the Brexit referendum — and even more rapidly since the pandemic spread around the world. With rivalry and antagonism between China and the West on the rise, Britain as a free agent will be caught uncomfortably in between, constantly forced to choose sides in a postpandemic world. “One consequence of a postglobalization world is that people will start to think in a defensive way about blocs,” said Mark Malloch Brown, a former deputy secretary general of the United Nations. “Britain is adrift without a bloc. That is going to be challenging, and a first example of this is Hong Kong.” British diplomats showed skill in lining up the United States, Canada and Australia to sign a stern letter to the Chinese government about the new law. But in defending the rights of those who hold British overseas passports, Britain is on its own. Neither the European Union, so recently forsaken by Britain, nor the United States, largely indifferent to human rights under President Trump, is eager to join that fight. Mr. Johnson once cast Britain’s independence as a competitive advantage. He said it would allow the country to pursue trade agreements with China, the United States or anyone else, unencumbered by the European Union. “As Global Britain, our range is not confined to the immediate European hinterland as we see the rise of new powers,” said Mr. Johnson, then serving as foreign secretary, in a speech to Chatham House in December 2016. “It is right that we should make a distinctive approach to policymaking, as regards China.” But as relations between China and the United States have soured, Mr. Johnson is caught in the middle. After initially fending off pressure from Mr. Trump to keep the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei out of Britain’s 5G digital network, Mr. Johnson has been forced to reconsider. Some analysts say they expect him to reverse himself and impose additional restrictions on Huawei. Part of the reason is technical: American sanctions on Huawei have raised the security risks of allowing the company to build a large part of the network. But part of it is geopolitical reality. In any coming Cold War between the United States and China, Britain cannot afford to alienate its most important ally. “The danger is finding ourselves trapped between President Trump and President Xi,” Mr. Patten said, referring to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. Mr. Trump’s faltering political fortunes pose another risk to Mr. Johnson. The president has enthusiastically supported Brexit and embraced the prime minister as a like-minded populist. If Mr. Trump were to lose in November, Mr. Johnson would face an uncertain new counterpart in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There is nothing to suggest that Mr. Biden would not champion the alliance with Britain. On some issues, like Iran and climate change, there would be fewer points of friction. But Mr. Biden is not likely to attach the same priority to a trade deal that Mr. Trump has. Former President Barack Obama famously warned Britons they would be at the “back of the queue” for trade talks if they voted for Brexit. Mr. Biden is also a devoted Irish-American who would look out for Ireland’s interests, as Britain negotiates its long-term trade relationship with the European Union (a breakthrough in those talks seems more elusive than ever). The preservation of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended years of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland, is an article of faith among Democrats. “Democrats are bewildered by the logic of Brexit, to begin with,” Mr. Malloch Brown said. “There is a very strong Democratic Irish lobby, which will be really watching like a hawk that this doesn’t put Ireland at a disadvantage.” To some critics, Global Britain was never more than a marketing slogan. After all, they said, Britain has for centuries seen itself as a global player, one that punched above its weight economically and militarily, long after the end of the empire and throughout its 47 years of membership in Europe’s institutions. Today, in any event, powerful Johnson advisers, like Dominic Cummings, are more concerned about transforming British society than asserting its influence abroad. They know the Conservative Party won its 80-seat Parliamentary majority with the votes of working-class people in Britain’s Midlands and north, who care more about saving their jobs than striking trade deals. Since Mr. Johnson’s victory, he has used the Global Britain label mainly to put a gloss on a bureaucratic decision: merging two government ministries, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. The rationale, he said, is to align Britain’s foreign aid with its strategic and commercial interests. Some former diplomats said Mr. Johnson should not stop there. “If you really want a Global Britain, and you want the Foreign Office to have genuine policy heft, then bring in the trade department,” said Simon Fraser, who once headed the Foreign Office. There are grounds for hope about Britain’s role. Its diplomats are pushing a proposal to expand the Group of 7 to include three other big democracies, South Korea, India and Australia. Other countries have welcomed it as an alternative to Mr. Trump’s much-maligned plan to invite Russia back into the club. Britain remains a substantial military power, with nuclear weapons and a close intelligence relationship with the United States and other allies — known as the Five Eyes — that analysts say has recovered since the strains over Huawei. Mr. Johnson made waves this week with a front-page column in an Israeli newspaper, in which he urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to annex occupied territories in the West Bank. Mr. Netanyahu has held off for now. Britain’s opposition Labour Party has also swung back to the mainstream, after a period in which it seemed influenced by anti-American sentiment and was tainted by allegations of anti-Semitism. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, has emerged as a fresh new voice on Britain’s place in the world. If the pandemic finally punctures the illusion of a Global Britain, Britain can take solace in what has not changed. It remains a midsize country, anchored in the West, deeply intertwined with Europe and inescapably lashed to the United States. “It has made them realize that they couldn’t have their cake and eat it too,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “That is a delusion that has now been stripped away. They’ve been forced back into their more traditional space.”']",Post-Brexit Britain is going it alone at a time when globalization is in retreat. But a clash with China over Hong Kong has shown the limits of what it can do.
"To Buy a Drink in This Border Town, Make Sure You’re in England",2020-07-05,By Stephen Castle,"['LLANYMYNECH — In normal times, no one takes much notice of the invisible border between England and Wales that runs through Llanymynech, a village with a post office, a church and no fewer than three pubs. But the Anglo-Welsh frontier, fought over in earlier centuries, has once again become a contested front line, this time for British drinkers. England allowed restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen on Saturday, meaning two pubs in Llanymynech could serve customers again after more than 100 days of coronavirus lockdown. Less than 100 yards away, on the Welsh side of the village, the Dolphin Inn remained firmly shuttered, in line with Welsh government rules delaying pub openings until July 13 — and then allowing drinking only in gardens or other outdoor spaces. The ruling has thrust the village into the media spotlight, reminding residents of the existence of an administrative border — more like a state line than an international frontier with passport checkpoints — that scythes through their village, even cutting through one building, and then snakes away through the surrounding countryside. It has forced John Turner, landlord of the closed Dolphin Inn, to consider his future and whether he might give up the pub trade. But on Saturday it did not stop him from having a drink at the rival Bradford Arms — in England — where he struck a philosophical tone over a pint of beer. “It is ridiculous,” Mr. Turner, who is English, said of the restrictions, “but there’s got to be a border at some point, it just so happens we are on it.” This is not the first time Llanymynech’s pubs have been at the sharp end of the Anglo-Welsh divide. In the spring of 2006, Wales banned smoking indoors in bars, a measure that was not introduced in England until in the summer of 2007, drawing many smokers to the two English pubs for the interim. Down the street from the Bradford Arms lies a now defunct hotel bisected by the official Anglo-Welsh border. In a previous era, one of its two bars was closed each Sunday, when by law pubs in England could open, but those in Wales could not. The rules are different this time because the Welsh government in Cardiff has power over issues like health, education and public administration. Like Scotland, Wales has generally taken a more cautious approach to coronavirus controls than England has, for example keeping travel restrictions in place and waiting longer to open nonessential shops. Wales plans to reopen the hospitality trade more slowly, partly in light of criticism from some scientists that England is taking an unnecessary risk by opening pubs, restaurants and many other businesses at the same time — and on a Saturday, when people tend to drink more. Public health experts say that outdoor venues pose less of a risk for spreading the virus, which is why drinkers in Welsh pubs will have to gather in beer gardens or parking lots when the rules are relaxed, at least initially. All this has forced residents of the border area to think about where they live, who is making decisions and who they blame for any inconvenience. “Normally, you don’t think about the border, but it has caused headaches because Wales has made different decisions,” said Ruth Allcock, a retired fitness trainer from the nearby village of Pant, England, as she headed to the Bradford Arms with her husband for lunch. Ms. Allcock added that Welsh travel restrictions had made it harder for her to see her grandchildren who live on that side of the border. “What we thought was the U.K. doesn’t appear to be that any more,” Ms. Allcock added. Inside the pub, some were pleased to be back in the familiar spots, including Jonathan Lawley, a tree surgeon who said he had been in the pub parking lot 10 minutes early, waiting for its 11:30 a.m. opening. “If they had been opening at 6 a.m. I would have been here at 10 to six,” he said. But at the post office and village store, on the Welsh side of the village, Jennifer Bridger said she and her husband would not go out for a drink until they could complete “the triangle” — visiting all three local pubs. “We can’t have a favorite,” Ms. Bridger, adding that although the post office is less than 100 yards from the border, she had been to England only once during the lockdown. A little further into Wales, Gareth Powell, who farms around 190 acres, was planning to venture to a pub in a different English village, crossing a border that was fought over so much in previous centuries that Mr. Powell has recovered a handful of musket balls on his land. The area had Bronze Age and Roman settlements, and Mr. Powell believes that his home is built on the site of Carreghofa Castle, which was thought to have been destroyed in the 13th century. “It’s always been borderland,” said Mr. Powell, who is unimpressed with the Welsh government’s decision making. “They do things differently just to justify being there. If they did the same as the English there would be no need for them, would there?” Jason Farr, the landlord of the other pub on the English side of Llanymynech, which reopened a few hours after the Bradford Arms, agreed. Mr. Farr, owner of the Cross Keys hotel, is English but lives in Wales — “It’s cheaper over the border,” he said — and described the frontier as something that is “never even thought about.” “The only time is if there is a sporting event, England versus Wales, where you will see half the village walking around in England shirts, half the people in Welsh shirts,” he said. “But there is no animosity between each other.” Mr. Farr was only partially reopening because of the worry that people would come in large numbers from Wales. On Saturday and Sunday, he was pouring drinks for just five hours and to a maximum of 40 customers who had made reservations. “I am relieved and happy and ecstatic that we are open and welcoming customers back into the place, but we have had to put extra restrictions in on our own behalf because Wales isn’t open,” Mr. Farr said. Back at the Bradford Arms around 40 people had gathered by late afternoon, but there was no sign of a mass invasion. Mick Williams, a retired aircraft engineer, confessed to having traveled from Wales to drink, though only by walking from the other end of the village. Bob Hedley, the landlord of the Bradford Arms, said he was happy with the reopening, but having stocked up with around 140 gallons of beer, he had not yet had to call for extra supplies. Mr. Turner had long since returned to the closed Dolphin Inn, explaining that he had other plans for the evening and for the coming days, when he will be visiting his mother. “I’m not hanging around to watch all this happen next week,” he said.']","Pubs are open in England, but coronavirus restrictions have not yet eased that far in Wales. So the owner of one village bar went to a rival establishment for a pint."
"As Neo-Nazis Seed Military Ranks, Germany Confronts ‘an Enemy Within’",2020-07-03,By Katrin Bennhold,"['CALW, Germany — As Germany emerged from its coronavirus lockdown in May, police commandos pulled up outside a rural property owned by a sergeant major in the special forces, the country’s most highly trained and secretive military unit. They brought a digger. The sergeant major’s nickname was Little Sheep. He was suspected of being a neo-Nazi. Buried in the garden, the police found two kilograms of PETN plastic explosives, a detonator, a fuse, an AK-47, a silencer, two knives, a crossbow and thousands of rounds of ammunition, much of it believed to have been stolen from the German military. They also found an SS songbook, 14 editions of a magazine for former members of the Waffen SS and a host of other Nazi memorabilia. “He had a plan,” said Eva Högl, Germany’s parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces. “And he is not the only one.” Germany has a problem. For years, politicians and security chiefs rejected the notion of any far-right infiltration of the security services, speaking only of “individual cases.” The idea of networks was dismissed. The superiors of those exposed as extremists were protected. Guns and ammunition disappeared from military stockpiles with no real investigation. The government is now waking up. Cases of far-right extremists in the military and the police, some hoarding weapons and explosives, have multiplied alarmingly. The nation’s top intelligence officials and senior military commanders are moving to confront an issue that has become too dangerous to ignore. The problem has deepened with the emergence of the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which legitimized a far-right ideology that used the arrival of more than a million migrants in 2015 — and more recently the coronavirus pandemic — to engender a sense of impending crisis. Most concerning to the authorities is that the extremists appear to be concentrated in the military unit that is supposed to be the most elite and dedicated to the German state, the special forces, known by their German acronym, the KSK. This week, Germany’s defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, took the drastic step of disbanding a fighting company in the KSK considered infested with extremists. Little Sheep, the sergeant major whose weapons stash was uncovered in May, was a member. Some 48,000 rounds of ammunition and 62 kilograms, or about 137 pounds, of explosives have disappeared from the KSK altogether, she said. Germany’s military counterintelligence agency is now investigating more than 600 soldiers for far-right extremism, out of 184,000 in the military. Some 20 of them are in the KSK, a proportion that is five times higher than in other units. But the German authorities are concerned that the problem may be far larger and that other security institutions have been infiltrated as well. Over the past 13 months, far-right terrorists have assassinated a politician, attacked a synagogue and shot dead nine immigrants and German descendants of immigrants. Thomas Haldenwang, president of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, has identified far-right extremism and terrorism as the “biggest danger to German democracy today.” In interviews I conducted over the course of the year with military and intelligence officials, and avowed far-right members themselves, they described nationwide networks of current and former soldiers and police officers with ties to the far right. In many cases, soldiers have used the networks to prepare for when they predict Germany’s democratic order will collapse. They call it Day X. Officials worry it is really a pretext for inciting terrorist acts, or worse, a putsch. “For far-right extremists, the preparation of Day X and its precipitation blend into one another,” Martina Renner, a lawmaker on the homeland security committee of the German Parliament, told me. The ties, officials say, sometimes reach deep into old neo-Nazi networks and the more polished intellectual scene of the so-called New Right. Extremists are hoarding weapons, maintaining safe houses, and in some cases keeping lists of political enemies. This week yet another case emerged, of a reservist, now suspended, who kept a list with cellphone numbers and addresses of 17 prominent politicians, who have been alerted. The case led to at least nine other raids across the country on Friday. Some German news media have referred to a “shadow army,” drawing parallels to the 1920s, when nationalist cells within the military hoarded arms, plotted coups and conspired to overthrow democracy. Most officials still reject this analogy. But the striking lack of understanding of the numbers involved, even at the highest levels of the government, has contributed to a deep unease. “Once they really started looking, they found a lot of cases,” said Konstantin von Notz, deputy president of the intelligence oversight committee in the German Parliament. “When you have hundreds of individual cases it begins to look like we have a structural problem. It is extremely worrying.” Mr. von Notz pointed out that Brendan Tarrant, who massacred 51 Muslim worshipers last year at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, had traveled Europe a year earlier and included an ominous line in his manifesto. “I would estimate the number of soldiers in European armed forces that also belong to nationalist groups to number in the hundreds of thousands, with just as many employed in law enforcement positions,” Mr. Tarrant had written. Investigators, Mr. von Notz said, “should take these words seriously.” But investigating the problem is itself fraught: Even the military counterintelligence agency, charged with monitoring extremism inside the armed forces, may be infiltrated. A high-ranking investigator in the extremism unit was suspended in June after sharing confidential material from the May raid with a contact in the KSK, who in turn passed it on to at least eight other soldiers, tipping them off that the agency might turn its attention to them next. “If the very people who are meant to protect our democracy are plotting against it, we have a big problem,” said Stephan Kramer, president of the domestic intelligence agency in the state of Thuringia. “How do you find them?” “These are battle-hardened men who know how to evade surveillance because they are trained in conducting surveillance themselves,” he added. “What we are dealing with is an enemy within.” The air inside the “shoot house” smelled acrid, so many live rounds had been fired. I was standing in the shooting range on the outskirts of the sleepy German town of Calw, in the Black Forest region, having been invited early this year for a rare visit inside the KSK’s base, the most heavily guarded in the country. A camouflaged soldier with a G36 assault rifle crouched along a broken door frame. Two shadows popped up. The soldier fired four times — head, torso, head, torso — then went on to systematically eliminate two dozen other “enemies.” He did not miss once. The KSK are Germany’s answer to the Navy Seals. But these days their commander, Gen. Markus Kreitmayr, an affable Bavarian who has done tours in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan, is a man divided between his loyalty to them and recognizing that he has a serious problem on his hands. The general was late for our interview. He had just spent four hours questioning a member of his unit about a party where half a dozen KSK soldiers were reported to have flashed Hitler salutes. “I can’t explain why there are allegedly so many cases of ‘far-right extremism’ in the military,” he said. The KSK is “clearly more affected than others, that appears to be a fact.” It was never easy to be a soldier in postwar Germany. Given its Nazi history and the destruction it foisted on Europe in World War II, the country maintains a conflicted relationship to its military. For decades, Germany tried to forge a force that represented a democratic society and its values. But in 2011 it abolished conscription and moved to a volunteer force. As a result, the military increasingly reflects not the broad society, but a narrower slice of it. General Kreitmayr said that “a big percentage” of his soldiers are eastern Germans, a region where the AfD does disproportionately well. Roughly half the men on the list of KSK members suspected of being far-right extremists are also from the east, he added. The general has called the current crisis in the unit “the most difficult phase in its history.” In our interview, he said that he could not rule out a significant degree of infiltration from the far right. “I don’t know if there is a shadow army in Germany,” he told me. “But I am worried,” he said, “and not just as the commander of the KSK, but as a citizen — that in the end something like that does exist and that maybe our people are part of it.” Officials talk of a perceptible shift “in values” among new recruits. In conversations, the soldiers themselves, who could not be identified under the unit’s guidelines, said that if there was a tipping point in the unit, it came with the migrant crisis of 2015. As hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan were making their way to Germany, the mood on the base was anxious, they recalled. “We are soldiers who are charged with defending this country and then they just opened the borders, no control,” one officer recalled. “We were at the limit.” It was in this atmosphere that a 30-year-old KSK soldier from Halle, in eastern Germany, set up a Telegram chat network for soldiers, police officers and others united in their belief that the migrants would destroy the country. His name was André Schmitt. But he goes by the nickname Hannibal. In a house in rural western Germany, behind a curtain of iron chains and past the crossbow in the hall, a dungeonlike room bathed in purple light opens into a bar area. An oversized image of a naked woman dominates the back wall. It was there that I met Mr. Schmitt early this year. He gave permission for his name to be used, but did not want the location disclosed or any photographs. He left active service last September after stolen training grenades were found at a building belonging to his parents. But, he says, he still has his network: “Special forces, intelligence, business executives, Freemasons,” he said. They meet here regularly. The house, he says, is owned by a wealthy supporter. “The forces are like a big family,” Mr. Schmitt told me, “everyone knows each other.” When he set up his Telegram chats in 2015, he did so geographically — north, south, east, west — just like the German military. In parallel, he ran a group called Uniter, an organization for security-related professionals that provides social benefits but also paramilitary training. Several former members of his chats are now under investigation by prosecutors for plotting terrorism. Some were ordering body bags. One faces trial. Mr. Schmitt’s situation is more complex. He acknowledged serving as an informer on the KSK for the military counterintelligence agency in mid-2017, when he met regularly with a liaison officer. Today the military is paying for him to get a business degree. He himself was never named a suspect. German officials denied that they protected him. But this week the domestic intelligence agency announced that it was placing his current network, Uniter, under surveillance. The authorities first stumbled onto his chats in 2017 while investigating a soldier in the network who was suspected of organizing a terror plot. Investigators are now looking into whether the chats and Uniter were the early skeleton of a nationwide far-right network that has infiltrated state institutions. As yet, they cannot say. The New York Times obtained police statements by Mr. Schmitt and others in his network related to the 2017 case. Initially, Mr. Schmitt and other members say, the chats were about sharing information, much of it about the supposed threats posed by migrants, which Mr. Schmitt admitted to the police he had inflated to “motivate” people. “It was about internal unrest because of sleeper cells and worldwide extremist groups, gang formations, terrorist threats,” Mr. Schmitt told the police.  The chats were popular among KSK soldiers. Mr. Schmitt said he counted 69 of his comrades in the network in 2015. A fellow KSK soldier, identified by investigators as Robert P., but known as Petrus, who ran two of the chats, told the police two years later that it might have been more than twice that: “I have to say, presumably half the unit was in there.” Soon the chats morphed from a platform for sharing information to one dedicated to preparing for Day X. Sipping mineral water, Mr. Schmitt described this as “war gaming.” He portrayed a Europe under threat from gangs, Islamists and Antifa. He called them “enemy troops on our ground.” His network helped members get ready to respond to what he portrayed as an inevitable conflict, sometimes acting on their own. “Day X is personal,” he said. “For one guy it’s this day, for another guy it’s another day.” ‘‘It’s the day you activate your plans,” he said. Chat members met in person, worked out what provisions and weapons to stockpile, and where to keep safe houses. Dozens were identified. One was the military base in Calw itself. They practiced how to recognize each other, using military code, at “pickup points” where members could gather on Day X. The sense of urgency grew.  On March 21, 2016, a chat member, identified only as Matze, wrote about a pickup point near Nuremberg. There were, he wrote, “sufficient weapons and ammo present to battle one’s way on.” Later that year, Mr. Schmitt sent a message to others in the chat network. In the previous 18 months, he wrote, they had gathered “2,000 like-minded people” in Germany and abroad. When I met him, Mr. Schmitt called it “a global like-minded brotherhood.”  He denies ever planning to bring about Day X, but he is still convinced that it will come, maybe sooner rather than later with the pandemic. “We know thanks to our sources in the banks and in the intelligence services that at the latest by the end of September the big economic crash will come,” he said in a follow-up phone call this week. “There will be insolvencies and mass unemployment,” he prophesied. “People will take to the street.” One night in 2017, Little Sheep, the sergeant major whose weapons stash was uncovered in May, was among about 70 KSK soldiers of Second Company who had gathered at a military shooting range. Investigators have identified him only as Philipp Sch. He and the others had organized a special leaving party for a lieutenant colonel, a man celebrated as a war hero for shooting his way out of an ambush in Afghanistan while carrying one of his men. The colonel, an imposing man covered in Cyrillic tattoos who enjoys cage-fighting in his spare time, had to complete an obstacle course. It involved hacking apart tree trunks and throwing severed pig heads. As a prize, his men had flown in a woman. But the colonel ended up dead drunk. The woman, rather than being his trophy, went to the police.  Standing by the fire with a handful of soldiers, she had witnessed them singing neo-Nazi lyrics and raising their right arm. One man stood out for his enthusiasm, she recalled in a televised report by the public broadcaster ARD. She called him the “Nazi grandpa.” Though just 45, “the Nazi grandpa” was Little Sheep, who had joined the KSK in 2001. In the three years since the party, the military counterintelligence service kept an eye on the sergeant major. But that did not stop the KSK from promoting him to the highest possible noncommissioned officer rank. The handling of the case fit a pattern, soldiers and officials say. In June, a KSK soldier addressed a 12-page letter to the defense minister, pleading for an investigation into what he described as a “toxic culture of acceptance” and “culture of fear” inside the unit. Tips about extremist comrades were “collectively ignored or even tolerated.” One of his instructors had likened the KSK to the Waffen SS, the soldier wrote. The instructor, a lieutenant colonel, was himself on the radar for far-right leanings since 2007, when he wrote a threatening email to another soldier. “You are being watched, no, not by impotent instrumentalized agencies, but by officers of a new generation, who will act when the times demand it,” it read. “Long live the holy Germany.” The KSK commander at the time did not suspend the lieutenant. He merely disciplined him. I asked General Kreitmayr, who took over command in 2018, about the case. “Look, today in the year 2020, with all the knowledge that we have, we look at the email from 2007 and say, ‘It’s obvious,’” he told me. “But at that time we only thought: Man, what’s wrong with him? He should pull himself together.” The back door of the main building on the base in Calw leads into a long corridor known as the “hallway of history,” a collection of memorabilia gathered over the KSK’s nearly 25 years that includes a stuffed German shepherd, Kato, who parachuted from 30,000 feet with a commando team. Conspicuously missing is any mention of a disgraced former KSK commander, Gen. Reinhard Günzel, who was dismissed after he wrote a 2003 letter in support of an anti-Semitic speech by a conservative lawmaker. General Günzel subsequently published a book called “Secret Warriors.” In it, he placed the KSK in the tradition of a notorious special forces unit under the Nazis that committed numerous war crimes, including massacres of Jews. He has been a popular speaker at far-right events. “What you basically have is one of the founding commanders of the KSK becoming a prominent ideologue of the New Right,” said Christian Weissgerber, a former soldier who has written a book about his own experience of being a neo-Nazi in the military. The New Right, which encompasses youth activists, intellectuals and the AfD, worries General Kreitmayr. The lawmaker whose anti-Semitic comments led to General Günzel’s firing all those years ago now sits in the German Parliament for the AfD. “You have leading representatives of political parties like the AfD, who say things that not only make you sick but that are clearly far-right, radical ideology,” General Kreitmayr said. Soldiers were not immune to this cultural shift in the country, he said. Just recently a fellow general had become a mayoral candidate for the AfD. Several former soldiers represent the party in Parliament. Down the hill from the shoot house is the Green Saloon, a cross between a boardroom and a bar. It is dominated by a vast oil painting depicting KSK soldiers and their German shepherd successfully attacking a Taliban hide-out. It is a scene familiar to several soldiers who had gathered the day I was there. But the soldiers I spoke with questioned the strategy behind a war that has run for two decades with few concrete results, except an increase in migration at home.  “My girls asked me: ‘Why do you have to go to Afghanistan when there are children from the Kunduz in our class?’” recounted one officer. “I did not have an answer.” When he took a delegation of KSK soldiers to meet with political parties in Parliament, he asked them the same question. “They did not have an answer, either,” he said. Only one lawmaker made a clear statement, he said. He was from the AfD. “He said we should have left a long time ago,” the officer recalled. Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.']",
Trump Hosts July 4 Event at White House as U.S. Coronavirus Cases Soar,2020-07-04,,"['This briefing has ended. Click here for the latest updates. After delivering a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore on Friday night, President Trump hosted a Fourth of July event in Washington on Saturday, again waving away objections from some officials and public health experts who were worried the virus could spread through the events’ crowds. There were few masks in the crowd at the White House as Mr. Trump walked out to the celebration and gave his address where he repeated the themes from the previous evening. “We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children or trample on our freedoms,” Mr. Trump said, referring to growing calls to remove statues perceived as symbols of racism and oppression. The demands increased during the widespread demonstrations against police brutality that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd while he was in the custody of the Minneapolis police. The protesters, Mr. Trump said, were “not interested in justice or healing.” Speaking to an audience that included front-line workers trying to combat the coronavirus, Mr. Trump bragged about his administration’s response, though the country’s death toll has climbed higher than his original predictions and local officials have warned against hosting a large gathering for Independence Day this year. Mr. Trump claimed that an abundance of testing made the country’s infections look worse than they were because they “show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless.” And he raised expectations for a vaccine “long before the end of the year.” Despite recent spikes in cases, Mr. Trump said that “we’ve made a lot of progress, our strategy is moving,” and told the crowd that “we’ve learned how to put out the flame.” But there has been a steep resurgence in U.S. infections, largely in the South and the West, since lockdowns abated after a decline in cases from a spring peak fueled by large numbers in the Northeast. The country’s single-day record for new cases stood for two months after it reached 36,738 on April 24. Since June 24, the record has been broken six times, most recently on Thursday, when 55,595 new infections were reported. Nearly 45,000 new daily cases were reported in the country on Saturday, according to a New York Times database, following a count of 53,917 on Friday, a figure exceeded only by Thursday’s record. Cases are trending upward in 39 states, and regularly reaching new single-day records. Idaho on Saturday reported more than 390 new infections, the state’s single-day record. At least two other states, Florida and South Carolina, also set records. Florida announced more than 11,400 new cases, its fourth record in 10 days and the second time in three days that the daily count was over 10,000. South Carolina hit a record on Friday only to break it on Saturday with more than 1,850 new cases. The state’s positivity rate — the percentage of overall coronavirus tests that come back positive — has hovered around 20 percent this week, up from about 10 percent in early June. Across the country, officials urged Americans to scale back their Fourth of July plans. Washington’s mayor, Muriel E. Bowser, was among them. Earlier in the week, she had criticized the White House’s plans, according to The Associated Press, saying, “We’ve communicated to them that we do not think this is in keeping with the best C.D.C. and Department of Health guidance.” As many as 80 percent of community fireworks displays in large cities and small towns have been canceled over fears that large gatherings could worsen the already alarming outbreaks happening across dozens of states. New coronavirus cases have increased 89 percent in the United States in the last two weeks. In New York City, instead of the usual hourlong fireworks extravaganza, Macy’s has been running five-minute displays in undisclosed locations across the five boroughs throughout the week. A grand finale on Saturday, also at an undisclosed location, will be televised. In Los Angeles County, the public health department ordered beaches closed and fireworks shows canceled. The police in Chicago were seen dispersing crowds gathered by waterfronts in defiance of an order to keep beaches in the city closed, according to a report from ABC. In Florida, Miami-Dade and Broward Counties had already announced that they were closing beaches for the Fourth of July weekend. A countywide curfew, from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., in Miami-Dade went into effect on Friday. During his event at Mount Rushmore on Friday, Mr. Trump barely mentioned the pandemic as he spoke to a packed, largely mask-free crowd, casting his effort to win a second term as a battle against a “new far-left fascism” that seeks to remake the nation’s heritage. The pandemic’s reach was still apparent, however: Before the event, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Mr. Trump’s eldest son and a top fund-raising official for the Trump re-election campaign, tested positive for the coronavirus. As coronavirus cases in Texas have soared to new heights in recent days, a number of hospitals in Houston have seen a steep rise in caseloads, filling intensive care units, overburdening staff, and straining testing capacity and the availability of other medical services. Protective gear and other medical devices for testing and treating patients have been scarce. Our correspondent Sheri Fink went behind the scenes at Houston Methodist, a top-ranked system of eight hospitals, and found that the staff is armed with the most up-to-date understanding of how to treat patients with Covid-19, and prepared with hindsight to avoid some of the mistakes that hospitals in New York made as they scrambled to handle a cascading outbreak in March. Many of Houston’s hospitals have already begun beefing up staff, and getting workers trained to handle patients as efficiently as possible. Some have also taken steps to keep elective procedures running to avoid the massive financial losses hospitals around the country faced earlier in the year when they adapted to focus nearly exclusively on patients with the coronavirus. “What’s been disheartening over the past week or two has been that it feels like we’re back at square one,” Dr. Mir M. Alikhan, a pulmonary and critical care specialist, said to his medical team before rounds. “It’s really a terrible kind of sinking feeling. But we’re not truly back at square one, right? Because we have the last three months of expertise that we’ve developed.” With a number of advantages on their side, many hospitals in the city hope to be able to weather the recent surge while keeping deaths to a minimum. Harris County, which contains most of the Houston metro area and has recorded the highest number of cases in Texas over all, has so far held its death count to 387. On Saturday, the state reported a record level of hospitalized Covid-19 patients — 7,890, with an increase of 238 from the previous day. Several states that were previously reluctant to impose broad public safety measures have reacted to the country’s growing surge of cases by moving to adopt them, particularly in anticipation of Independence Day celebrations on Saturday. But while some people will gather for a traditional celebration, others will be assembling to protest the new restrictions. Arizona had strongly resisted sweeping regulations on businesses and individuals, making it one of the most cavalier states regarding Covid-19. But as cases there have skyrocketed and its intensive care beds have filled to near capacity, Arizona’s leaders have been rethinking their hands-off approach. At least 91,894 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in Arizona to date, reaching a single-day high of 4,797 new cases on June 30, according to data compiled by The New York Times. On Monday, Gov. Doug Ducey signed an executive order prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people and pausing reopenings of bars, gyms and movie theaters. The governor’s office has also allowed local jurisdictions to set stricter limits of their own, including ordinances requiring masks. Maricopa County — which has averaged more than 2,500 new cases over the last week — passed its own regulations requiring face coverings in public. Other localities are also seeing resistance to statewide measures. In Kansas, the Board of Sedgwick County Commissioners voted not to mandate that people wear masks in public but just to recommend it, despite a statewide mask ordinance issued by Gov. Laura Kelly. “It’s probably the most innocuous, painless, relatively speaking, intervention we can do,” Dr. Garold Minns, the county’s public health officer, said at a commission meeting, voicing support for the state initiative. Still, county officials decided that individuals had the ability to make responsible decisions without government-imposed rules, especially if residents could maintain a six-foot distance. Some Texas counties have pushed back on Gov. Greg Abbott’s mask-wearing mandate, announced Thursday, under which residents could be fined up to $250 for noncompliance. In Nacogdoches County, Sheriff Jason Bridges made clear that his office would not be issuing citations for those who didn’t wear masks. “We are not keeping a database of people who wear a mask and who are not. I mean we don’t have the time or the energy to do that,” Mr. Bridges said. The Australian state of Victoria has completely locked down nine public housing towers in Melbourne, its capital, telling about 3,000 residents that they cannot leave their homes for any reason for at least five days. The strict quarantine, which is the first of its kind in Australia during the pandemic and is being monitored by hundreds of police officers, started immediately on Saturday afternoon after 23 coronavirus infections were found in 12 of the towers’ households. Public health officials said everyone in the towers would be tested over the next few days. “There is a lot of intermingling of the people between those towers for work, for family, for community events,” said Dr. Paul Kelly, Australia’s acting chief medical officer. The crowded towers are filled with a mix of immigrant families and low-income older people, many with chronic conditions that would make them more vulnerable to an infection. Hundreds of residents appear to have already been exposed to the virus, Dr. Kelly said, calling the towers “vertical cruise ships” with the potential to cause a major surge in cases at a time when Australia’s infections are already rising because of an outbreak across several Melbourne suburbs. “We have to take particular notice and particular attention to make sure that the spread is minimized and that people are protected,” Dr. Kelly said. Some residents objected to being quarantined without notice. Abdi Ibrahim, who lives in a three-bedroom apartment in one of the towers with his five children, including 7-month-old twins, told The Australian the lockdown was imposed so quickly that he had no time to buy groceries for his family. He also had to cancel his Sunday shift at a logistics company. “I’m a casual, if I don’t work I don’t get paid,” he said, adding: “We are so isolated, you know what I mean, it’s like a prison.” Officials said they would provide tower residents with food as well as cash compensation and rent relief. As the towers were being locked down, officials also added two more Melbourne postal codes to the 10 others already under stay-at-home orders, affecting a total of more than 300,000 people. Unlike residents of the towers, people in these areas are allowed to leave their homes for work or education, exercise, medical care, care-giving or shopping for essential supplies. Australia’s total case count remains relatively small — the island nation had around 560 active cases as of Sunday night, out of a total of about 8,000 — but public health officials have become increasingly alarmed by the outbreak in Melbourne. About 200 new cases emerged in and around the city over the past two days, a rate of growth not seen since March. On Sunday, the Australian Medical Association called for a temporary pause in the easing of restrictions in all states and territories until the Melbourne outbreak is brought under control. “We all can and must do better,” said Dr. Tony Bartone, the association’s president. “Australians should not rush back to pre-Covid ways.” When the U.S. economy ground to a halt this spring, economists warned that an avalanche of evictions was looming. The federal government and many states rushed to ban them temporarily, placing moratoriums on mortgage foreclosures to relieve financial pressure on landlords. But 20 states, including Louisiana, Texas, Colorado and Wisconsin, have since lifted their restrictions, and researchers have tracked thousands of recent eviction filings in places where data is available. Eviction bans in nine other states and at the federal level are set to expire by the end of the month. All told, Amherst College anticipates that nearly 28 million households are at risk of being turned out onto the streets because of job losses tied to the pandemic. Even in places with ordinances barring evictions, the protections have been of little help to unauthorized immigrants, who fear that complaining to the authorities about their landlord could lead to a consequence worse than homelessness: deportation. Immigrant and renter advocates in cities across the country say they are being inundated with complaints about landlords pressuring tenants to pay rent money. They say landlords use harassment, illegal fees for late payments or repairs, or simply change the locks as a way to force out vulnerable renters. Norieliz Dejesus is a program manager with the organization Chelsea Collaborative, in Chelsea, Mass., a hub for incoming migrants from Eastern Europe and Central America. “I had one tenant whose landlord wants her out by the end of the month,” Ms. Dejesus said. “The tenant explained the new laws. The landlord acknowledged the new laws and was like, ‘I don’t care — you have to leave.’” The governor of Kansas has called on a Republican county chairman to remove a cartoon from his newspaper’s Facebook page that invokes the Holocaust to criticize her order requiring Kansans to wear masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The cartoon, posted on the Facebook page of The Anderson County Review, shows the state’s Democratic governor, Laura Kelly, wearing a mask emblazoned with the Star of David against a backdrop of people being loaded onto a cattle car. “Lockdown Laura says: Put on your mask … and step onto the cattle car,” reads a caption on the cartoon, which was posted on Friday, the same day an order by Ms. Kelly went into effect requiring Kansans to wear masks in public spaces and in places where social distancing is not possible. The Anderson County Review is owned by Dane Hicks, the chairman of the Anderson County Republican Party. Mr. Hicks defended the cartoon, which he said he had made himself and planned to publish in the newspaper on Tuesday. “Political editorial cartoons are gross over-caricatures designed to provoke debate and response — that’s why newspapers publish them — fodder for the marketplace of ideas,” he wrote in an email. “The topic here is the governmental overreach which has been the hallmark of Governor Kelly’s administration.” He scoffed at the idea of an apology. “Apologies: To whom exactly?” he wrote. “The critics on the Facebook page? Facebook is a cesspool and I only participate to develop readership.” He added that he “intended no slight” to Jews or Holocaust survivors. The Anderson County Review’s cartoon was posted as the pandemic continues to rage in many parts of the country, with cases trending upward in 39 states, including Kansas, and regularly reaching new single-day records. The World Health Organization on Saturday formally suspended its evaluation of two high-profile drug candidates in clinical trials designed to identify treatments effective against the coronavirus. The W.H.O. formally adopted the recommendations of a steering committee and dropped the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine from its Solidarity trial, as well as the drug combination lopinavir/ritonavir, first developed as an antiviral against H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Hydroxychloroquine was promoted by the Trump administration as a preventive and treatment for Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. But neither hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir/ritonavir has shown benefits in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. In clinical trials, both drugs have failed to reduce deaths among those with severe symptoms. And though neither drug appeared to increase the risk of death, the W.H.O. report cited possible safety issues associated with both treatments. A similar clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine, led by the National Institutes of Health, was halted in June, based on recent evidence of the drug’s lackluster performance. Just days prior, the Swiss drugmaker Novartis had discontinued its own hydroxychloroquine clinical trial after it was unable to enroll the 440 participants it needed. The F.D.A. has also revoked emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients, and now cautions against using the drug, which has been linked to reports of serious heart rhythm problems, blood and lymph system disorders and other side effects. The W.H.O.’s decision applies only to its studies involving patients hospitalized with Covid-19, leaving open the possibility for further evaluation of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in infected patients who have not yet been admitted to the hospital, or as a treatment to prevent those exposed to the coronavirus from getting sick. In the United States, clinical trials studying both drugs continue. The Solidarity trial is also continuing its explorations of two other treatment strategies: one involving remdesivir, an antiviral that has been shown to speed recovery in patients hospitalized with Covid-19, and a second that combines lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta-1a, which decreases inflammation. Iraq’s caseload has increased eightfold in the last month, rising from about 250 new cases daily to 2,000 at the end of June. Deaths have increased as well, with about 100 people dying daily compared with fewer than 50 daily a month ago. And signs are piling up that the country’s health care system is on the verge of breaking down. The director of public health for Najaf Province, Dr. Radwan al-Kindi, said: “I am tired, so tired. We have 250 doctors, nurses and paramedics in quarantine or in the hospital because they have Covid.” He listed close colleagues who had been infected, ending with “and now my bodyguard just tested positive.” He knows he could well be next. Already 1,000 doctors, most of them mainstays at hospitals around the country where they are exposed to the virus, are infected, according to the head of the Iraqi doctor’s union, Dr. Abdul Ameer al-Shimmeri. There were already relatively few medical staff willing to work directly with infected patients. Now the situation is dire. “We are in crisis and we have no control over the virus,” Dr. al-Shimmeri said. “There is an absence of preventative equipment for doctors. Most of them are paying for their own and using it more than once.”  Oxygen is in such short supply that a prominent Shiite cleric and politician tweeted about Iraq’s fourth-largest city: “Nasiriyah can’t breathe.” The country’s number of confirmed cases is at least 56,000 but could be more because labs are having difficulty handling the number of samples that come in. Some doctors complain that it takes 11 days or more to get test results, which are delayed by a lack of staff and the volume of tests. Mohammed Ghanem, who runs the busy lab at Sadr Medical City Teaching Hospital in Baghdad, said, “Most of my staff is sick, so I am trying to train new staff, but they do not have experience.” Global Roundup Thailand on Saturday marked 40 days without any locally transmitted cases of the coronavirus, a feat that mirrors those of regional counterparts, like Vietnam and Laos. Earlier this year, it didn’t look so promising for a country that was one of the most popular tourist destinations on Earth. In mid-January, Thailand confirmed the first case of the coronavirus outside China, in a visitor from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak first emerged. Foreign tourists continued to arrive for months, until Thailand shut its airports to most international flights in early April. But even before the flight lockdown, many Thais were vigilant about wearing face masks. Social greetings in the country aren’t of the hug and kiss variety, perhaps creating fewer opportunities for the virus to spread. So far, Thailand has recorded fewer than 3,200 cases of the coronavirus, with 58 deaths. With local transmission seemingly under control, schools reopened on July 1. The country’s notorious nightlife has revved up again, with entertainers required to wear face masks with their often brief costumes. This weekend, Thais began traveling by the millions for a four-day holiday, crowding airports and train and bus stations that had been largely empty for three months. But with limits on international visitors still in place, Thailand’s tourism-dependent economy is likely to suffer the worst hit of any regional economy this year. A maximum of 200 foreigners are being allowed in to Thailand each day. Other coronavirus news from around the world: India hit another one-day high in new confirmed infections on Sunday, reporting 24,850 cases in the previous 24 hours along with 613 deaths. The country has had more than 673,000 cases and more than 19,000 deaths in total. The governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, who has been praised for her pandemic response, is expected to win re-election on Sunday. But the Japanese capital is facing a rise in new infections, including 131 on Saturday, its third straight day over 100. A senior adviser to Afghanistan’s president died from the coronavirus late Friday as the country grapples with the virus’s spread amid a lack of reliable data and an overwhelmed health sector. The adviser, Mohammad Yousuf Ghazanfar, was a presidential envoy for economic development and poverty alleviation. Although experts say Afghanistan’s official numbers are not even close to an indication of the true spread, the country’s health ministry has recorded 32,000 positive cases and over 800 deaths. Pubs across England reopened on Saturday, three and a half months after being shuttered for the first time in the country’s history. The pubs were allowed to resume business at 6 a.m., an hour chosen because the authorities aimed to prevent a rush of late-night crowds that might accompany a midnight reopening. During Britain’s lockdown, pubs served to-go drinks but were forbidden to welcome patrons inside. Although Paris’s official Pride march was postponed until November because of the pandemic, several organizations planned to hold a smaller version in the French capital on Saturday. Organizers said they intended to give it a political tone and speak out against the “silent capitalization” of Pride events. The Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona, one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, moved to reopen on Saturday, giving exclusive access to front-line workers who aided in the city’s coronavirus response. In North Carolina, the governor vetoed efforts by lawmakers to reopen skating rinks, bowling alleys and amusement parks. In Alaska, new workplace clusters are emerging, social distancing is on the decline and contact tracers are overwhelmed. And in Kansas, state and local leaders are squabbling over whether masks are required. “Early on, people who tested positive usually had a short list of close contacts,” Dr. Joe McLaughlin, Alaska’s state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “Now, as people are mixing more with others, it’s not uncommon for someone who tests positive to have had dozens of close contacts, sometimes too many to name and call.” The struggles in those three states, all of which set single-day case records on Friday, exemplify the challenges officials across the country face as cases surge. Unlike the first spike in March and April, when most places were on lockdown, case numbers are now exploding after many Americans have returned to their routines and grown frustrated with restrictions. In Kansas, where more than 780 cases were announced on Friday, residents have heard mixed messages from their leaders. This week, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, ordered residents to wear masks in public. Commissioners in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, then voted to make Ms. Kelly’s mask mandate a recommendation, not a requirement. But on Friday, the Wichita City Council convened in a special meeting and approved a mask mandate, effective immediately, with the possibility of fines for those who refuse. “We have a shot of avoiding another shut down, of ensuring our kids have school & protecting folks,” Mayor Brandon Whipple of Wichita said on Twitter after the city’s mask rule was approved. Similar whiplash was seen in North Carolina, where the Republican-controlled Legislature passed bills that would have curtailed business restrictions enacted by Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat. But Mr. Cooper stepped in and vetoed the measures, meaning roller skating rinks and bowling alleys, along with some other businesses, must remain closed. “Opening these higher-risk facilities would spread Covid-19 and endanger the state’s flexibility to open the public schools,” Mr. Cooper said in a veto statement. An international group of 239 experts is calling on the World Health Organization to recognize that the coronavirus can be spread through the air, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. In an open letter the researchers plan to publish, they say there is clear evidence that the virus can be transmitted by microdroplets, called aerosols. The W.H.O.’s official guidance discounts aerosols as a major form of transmission, saying the virus is spreading mostly through larger respiratory droplets that don’t travel far. But most of the recent research suggests the scientists are correct, with enormous implications for how people should protect themselves. For example, ventilation systems in schools, nursing homes, residences and businesses may need to minimize recirculating air, aim to provide clean outside air, and add powerful filters or ultraviolet lights that can destroy the virus. Health care workers may need to wear N95 masks that filter the smallest respiratory droplets whenever they care for Covid-19 patients. “If we started revisiting airflow, we would have to be prepared to change a lot of what we do,” said Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who sits on the W.H.O.’s infection control committee. “I think it’s a good idea, a very good idea, but it will cause an enormous shudder through the infection control society.” Even in its latest update on the coronavirus, released June 29, the W.H.O. said airborne transmission of the virus was possible only after medical procedures that produced aerosols, or droplets smaller than 5 microns. Proper ventilation and N95 masks are only of concern in those circumstances, according to the guidance. Dr. Benedetta Allegranzi, the W.H.O.’s technical lead for infection prevention and control, said the evidence for the virus spreading by air was unconvincing. “Especially in the last couple of months, we have been stating several times that we think airborne transmission is possible but certainly not supported by solid or even clear evidence,” she said. “There is a strong debate on this.” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh on Saturday rejected a request from Illinois Republicans to allow large political gatherings, including a Fourth of July picnic, leaving them without a reprieve from an order from the state’s governor barring most gatherings of more than 50 people. In their emergency application to the Supreme Court, the Illinois Republican Party and other Republican groups said the order from Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, interfered with their First Amendment rights. The application said Mr. Pritzker had drawn unconstitutional distinctions by exempting religious services but not political gatherings from his order. The First Amendment, they said, prohibits the government from discrimination based on the content of speech unless it can meet a demanding standard of review. Judge Sara L. Ellis of the Federal District Court in Chicago rejected the Republicans’ request for an injunction. “The Constitution,” she wrote, “does not accord a political party the same express protections as it provides to religion.” A unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, refused to stay Judge Ellis’s ruling while the case moved forward. Justice Kavanaugh, the justice who oversees the Seventh Circuit, denied the Republicans’ application without comment. Ten months after Hurricane Dorian pulverized the northern Bahamas, the islands are still struggling to recover, even as this year’s hurricane season begins. But rebuilding, always a slow process, has been hampered even further this year by the coronavirus. “That brought rebuilding efforts to a complete halt,” said Stafford Symonette, an evangelical pastor whose house on Great Abaco Island was severely damaged during the hurricane — and remains that way. “You still have a lot of people in tents and temporary shelters.” The Bahamas — like other hurricane-prone countries in the Caribbean and North Atlantic — now find themselves at the convergence of a devastating pandemic and an Atlantic hurricane season that is expected to be more active than usual. The pandemic has crippled economies in the region, many of which depend heavily on tourism. It has forced the reallocation of diminished government resources to deal with the public health crisis. And it has meant that, in the event of a major storm, evacuation centers and shelters could turn into dangerous vectors of coronavirus contagion. These mounting challenges have overwhelmed many of the region’s governments and relief agencies, which are scrambling to make arrangements before the next big storm. “Are we prepared for this hurricane season?” said Ronald Sanders, ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the United States and to the Organization of American States. “The answer is no. And I don’t care who tells you we are.” “The reality,” he added, “is that we are in dire straits.” After a minor late-spring lull, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States is again on the rise. States like Arizona, Florida and Texas are seeing some of their highest numbers to date, and as the nation hurtles deeper into summer, the surge shows few signs of stopping. Yet the virus appears to be killing fewer of the people it infects — a seemingly counterintuitive trend that might not last, experts said. In April and May, Covid-19 led to as many as 3,000 deaths per day and claimed the lives of roughly 7 to 8 percent of Americans known to have been infected. Now, even though cases are rising in most states, the number of daily deaths is closer to 600 and the death rate is less than 5 percent. Because death reports can lag behind diagnoses by weeks, the current rise in coronavirus cases could portend increases in mortality in the days to come. However, a few factors can also help explain the apparent drop. One is increased diagnostic testing, which has identified many more infected people with mild or no symptoms. That means those who die with Covid-19 form a smaller overall proportion of cases, said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. And with more tests available, infections are often identified earlier, “which allows us to intervene earlier,” said Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease expert in Arizona. Health experts also noted that treatments had improved and that the virus was now infecting more young people, who are less likely to die of Covid-19. On New Year’s Day, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called for a “frontal breakthrough to foil the enemies’ sanctions.” The strategy meant finding new sources of income, legal or illegal, and mainly from China. But there was one thing Mr. Kim did not foresee: the coronavirus. Barely three weeks after he unveiled his New Year’s resolution, North Korea shut down \u200bits border with China to protect itself against the emerging outbreak in the city of Wuhan. It was no ordinary border\u200b closure. China accounted for 95 percent of the North’s trade. Consumer goods, raw materials, fuel and machine parts smuggled into the North across their 870-mile border kept North Korean markets and factories sputtering along, despite United Nations sanctions designed to curb the Kim regime’s nuclear ambitions. Now, with the border sealed, the North’s official exports to China have crashed even further. In March, they were worth just $610,000, according to Chinese customs data — down 96 percent from a year earlier. The North’s newly opened ski and spa resorts are empty of Chinese tourists, and its smuggling ships sit idle in their ports. North Korea claims to have no coronavirus cases. But it was one of the first countries to shut its border, aware that its woefully underequipped public health system made it particularly vulnerable to mass infection. “To North Korea, Covid-19 is a black swan,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “None of its policymakers saw it coming.” President Trump on Saturday signed into law a five-week extension of a federal loan program for small businesses, days after the program shuttered. The initiative — the Paycheck Protection Program, created as part of the $2.2 stimulus law in March — allows small businesses to receive federal loans that can be forgiven if payrolls are maintained at a certain level. The program had shuttered on Tuesday with more than $130 billion in unspent loan money, after allocating $520 billion in loans to nearly five million businesses nationwide. But just hours before, senators unexpectedly reached agreement on a five-week extension, to Aug. 8. The House cleared it on Wednesday afternoon without a formal vote. A much broader and more polarized clash between Republicans and Democrats over whether to extend other assistance programs set to lapse this summer — such as enhanced unemployment benefits that expire at the end of July — will wait until later in the month, with members of both chambers scattered across the country for the Fourth of July and not scheduled to fully return for two weeks. Two weeks after Spain lifted a state of emergency and began allowing in visitors from European countries for the first time in three months, the authorities in the Catalonia region have imposed a lockdown on 200,000 residents to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. The new restriction in Spain, which has largely brought under control one of the most severe outbreaks in Europe, reflects the type of measures that governments in Europe and beyond are relying on as new hot spots emerge. The lockdown is being imposed in the Segriá area, which people will be allowed to enter and leave for work purposes. In an effort to prevent a local hospital from being overwhelmed, the authorities have also set up a field hospital in the city of Lleida, 100 miles west of Barcelona, to help handle a coronavirus caseload that has more than doubled in a week. Spain once boasted of having one of the world’s best health care systems, but its hospital workers were pummeled by the coronavirus at the height of the nation’s outbreak, which has killed over 28,000 people. In the south of the country, new clusters have appeared in the city of Granada and in a refugee camp in the province of Málaga. And in the northwestern province of Galicia, hundreds of residents have been asked to quarantine after a new outbreak was detected. Local lockdowns have also been introduced elsewhere in Europe, including in the English city of Leicester, 100 miles north of London, and in the German city of Gütersloh, after an outbreak at a meat processing plant. An earlier version of this item misidentified a Spanish city where a field hospital has been set up. It is Lleida, not Leida, and it is 100 miles west of Barcelona, not 100 miles east.

Trial of 20 Saudis in Jamal Khashoggi Killing Opens in Turkey,2020-07-03,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Turkey opened a trial into the death of the Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul on Friday, accusing 20 Saudi citizens in absentia, in a case that friends and human rights officials welcomed as an important step in advancing the search for justice in his killing. None of the accused were present for the trial — Saudi Arabia has declined to extradite them — and it was unclear whether the court could legally pursue the case without defendants. Nonetheless, the start of the proceedings was seen as a sign that Turkey and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan\xa0— who personally knew Mr. Khashoggi and was outraged that the killing took place in Istanbul — are determined to pursue those responsible and even implicate the Saudi kingdom’s day-to-day ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Khashoggi was killed when he visited the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to obtain papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. He never emerged from the meeting. His body was dismembered, and his remains have never been found. Mr. Khashoggi, 59, a Saudi dissident, fled the kingdom and wrote columns for The Washington Post that were critical of his country’s leadership. His killing undermined the image of Prince Mohammed as a young ruler working to open up the kingdom’s economy and society. The Saudi government has prosecuted 11 men for carrying out the killing, and sentenced five of them to death in December, but did not find any senior officials responsible. The Turkish indictment accuses 18 men of carrying out murder with monstrous intent and inflicting grave torment. Two others, both close aides to Prince Mohammed — Ahmed al-Asiri, the former deputy head of Saudi general intelligence; and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the crown prince — were indicted on incitement to murder with monstrous intent and inflicting grave torment.  Ms. Cengiz described in testimony to the court how she first realized something was wrong as she waited for Mr. Khashoggi outside the consulate. “Someone of 25 to 30 years old came out,” she said, according to Turkish reporters who were inside the court. “He had an anxiety-inducing, fearful facial expression.” “He said ‘I checked the rooms, there’s nobody,’ but he couldn’t look at my face,” she added. “At that moment, I experienced a fear I had never experienced before in my life. It wasn’t only fear, it was horror.” She named a consulate employee called Ekrem Sultan as the person who had called Mr. Khashoggi to attend a meeting on Oct. 2. “They summoned him with great betrayal and trickery,” she said. “When they killed Jamal, they hurt something very big,” she concluded. “They hurt the image of Islam and justice.” Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Mr. Erdogan and close friend of Mr. Khashoggi, described how Mr. Khashoggi’s criticism of Prince Mohammed and his policies, in particular his prosecution of the war in Yemen and boycott of Qatar, had forced him to flee Saudi Arabia. Mr. Khashoggi’s role as the head of advocacy group Democracy for the Arab World Now irritated the Saudi leadership still further, Mr. Aktay said. “The activities of the association made the government of Saudi Arabia angry,” he noted. “To them, democracy is like a curse.” Mr. Aktay said that Mr. al-Qahtani had communicated with Mr. Khashoggi on WhatsApp and told him that he needed to stop talking and return to Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Aktay said he had advised his friend not to go to the Oct. 2 meeting at the Saudi Consulate. “I said it might be a trap, but he did not take my warning seriously,” he said. Seven other Turkish witnesses who worked at the consulate also took the stand on Friday. Several workers said they were ordered not to go to the consul’s residence, a building down the street from the consulate, that day. Zeki Demir, a technician, said he was called to the consul’s residence at 2 p.m. on Oct. 2 to light the gas oven in the garden used for barbecues. “There was an air of panic,” he said. “It was as if they wanted me to leave as soon as possible. I left after lighting the oven.” Turkish lawyers representing the defendants said that they had not been able to reach them for consultations, but they said that their clients denied the claims. The board of judges announced that the next hearing would be held Nov. 24. The Turkish trial offers the closest chance for justice available in the Khashoggi killing, said Agnès Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, who arrived in Istanbul on Thursday to attend. “It is going to give a different meaning and a more rigorous approach to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, which is what we should expect from a trial,” she said on the eve of the proceedings. Despite Turkey’s reputation in recent years for poor application of judicial standards — critics have cited the justice system’s lack of independence and the abuse of defendants’ rights among other criticisms — Ms. Callamard said she hoped the proceedings would reveal more about the chain of command in the killing. Ms. Callamard concluded after a five-month investigation that Mr. Khashoggi’s death had been carefully planned and endorsed by high-level Saudi officials. C.I.A. officials have concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing. Ms. Callamard said she hoped the trial would reveal what investigators had found in Mr. Khashoggi’s cellphone and computer, and whether the devices had been hacked which could indicate intent to do him harm. She said the proceedings had a broader significance. “It is important also for the rest of the world — we have to keep insisting that no one can kill a journalist and get away with it lightly,” she said. “We need to keep insisting that he pays a price,” she added of Prince Mohammed. The Turkish indictment alleges that Mr. Khashoggi was “considered by Saudi officials and authorities as a threat against the government of Saudi Arabia, because of his articles, speeches in the meetings and conferences he joined, and his dissident acts for the change of the government.” The intention of the Saudi authorities was to bring him back to the kingdom and if he did not agree, to kill him, the indictment states. On issuing the indictment in March, the Istanbul prosecutor said in a statement that it was based on evidence from cellphone location records of the accused, records of their entry and exit from Turkey, and their presence at the consulate. Evidence was also drawn from searches of their hotel rooms, the consulate and the consul’s residence; from Mr. Khashoggi’s cellphone, laptop and iPad; and from witness statements, the statement added. The indictment names 54 witnesses, including 26 Turkish members of staff of the consulate and the consul’s residence, among them drivers, clerks, translators, cooks, cleaners and a tea server. Mr. Erdogan is pursuing a proxy war on several political and regional levels with the Saudi crown prince — although he has made a point of showing respect to the Saudi king — and will be seeking a verdict that damages his rival, said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “He is going to use the trial to embarrass the crown prince by reaching a very different set of conclusions,” Mr. Cagaptay said, “and also having his own verdict so that the case does not end with the Saudi verdict.”']",Supporters of the slain journalist expressed hope that the proceedings would offer a chance for justice. The defendants are to be tried in absentia.
Our Supreme Court Correspondent on This Week’s Abortion Ruling,2020-07-03,By Alisha Haridasani Gupta,"['Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Louisiana law that required doctors who perform abortions in the state to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. This was the first major abortion case before the Supreme Court since President Trump added two new conservative justices to the bench — and was one piece in the anti-abortion movement’s long-term, sustained effort to limit access to the procedure through a latticework of state laws. As of June, there were at least 16 abortion cases before United States appeals courts, the last step before the Supreme Court, according to lawyers at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Many of these laws could present a more direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established federal protection for abortion, than the Louisiana and Texas laws. In an interview, The Times’s Supreme Court reporter, Adam Liptak, discussed what Monday’s ruling means for the future of Roe v. Wade. The conversation has been edited for clarity. Adam, were you surprised by this outcome? I was somewhat surprised. There was good reason to think the court would uphold the Louisiana law restricting abortion in the state because we have two new justices appointed by President Trump since the last time the court addressed the issue in 2016. And because in 2016, Chief Justice John Roberts dissented from the ruling striking down the almost identical law in Texas. So those three votes you would have thought would have been on the anti-abortion side. The departure in 2018 of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was in the majority in the 2016 decision, also suggested that this was going to be a loss for supporters of abortion rights. But there was a nuance in the ruling, right? Chief Justice Roberts said that the Texas case was “wrongly decided” but that he went with it anyway because of precedent — not because he’d changed his mind about the facts. What does that mean down the line? He said he was voting as he did because he was bound by the earlier precedent. That suggests that different kinds of abortion restrictions could well survive Supreme Court review. And there are lots of states using creative measures to try to restrict abortion. In endorsing a high level of respect for precedent, it might suggest that the chief justice would be willing to uphold earlier decisions on the ultimate question of Roe v. Wade — the constitutional right to an abortion. Given the precedent of Roe v. Wade and the chief justice’s emphasis on precedent, is abortion access really threatened? How high is the bar for the Supreme Court to overturn a constitutional right? Judges and justices have complicated formulas about when it’s appropriate to overturn a precedent. They look at things like: Was it egregiously wrong when it was decided? Has it turned out to be workable in practice? Have people, in this case women, come to rely on it? You’ll find different judges giving different answers to those questions. Respect for precedent is governed by a complicated web of principles that different people can apply in different ways. There’s another case concerning contraception that will be decided in the coming days. Tell me about it. This is the latest in an ongoing battle about regulations under the Affordable Care Act, which guaranteed free contraception coverage to most women workers. It has always been complicated because the initial regulation set a carve-out for houses of worship, including churches, temples and mosques. Most other employers had to provide the coverage. And the Supreme Court, in a series of decisions, has allowed other exceptions and accommodations. But when the Trump administration came in, it issued its own regulations, which allowed just about anybody — any employer with religious or moral objections to providing contraception coverage — to opt out. And the question before the court is whether those regulations are lawful. And which way do you think the court will rule? I suspect that just as the initial regulations were not in the Affordable Care Act statute itself but adopted by the Obama administration, a majority of the court is likely to say that the Trump administration is also entitled to adopt different regulations, at least for religious objectors. In the hearing for the contraception case, were the justices stumbling over the definition of “moral”? Did you hear that come through? Because of Covid-19, I listened to the hearing on the telephone — this was one of the court’s recent telephone arguments — and the justices did not really explore how courts are meant to decide what counts as a valid moral objection. But the lawyer challenging the new regulations certainly said the concept was vague and amorphous. On the one hand, access to abortion has been protected, but access to contraception might be restricted. That paints quite a mixed picture. Yes. As a general matter, what you say is right. But you could sort of harmonize the two decisions if they come out to be as we’ve sketched out. Women have to pay for abortions. The question in the contraception case is not whether you can have access to contraception but whether you must pay for it. And I don’t mean to minimize the burden that paying for contraception can be, but they’re not entirely on the same plane. What does it say that the Supreme Court was even willing to take up these two cases together, especially the abortion case, so soon after the 2016 ruling? It does seem weird that the Supreme Court should revisit an issue on the identical question after only a four-year gap with a change of personnel on the court — that looks pretty ugly. But in its defense, a federal appeals court had sustained the Louisiana law and seemingly thumbed its nose at the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision. So the court really had little choice but to take up the abortion case. As far as the contraception case, a federal appeals court effectively struck down the Trump administration regulation, and when that happens, it’s not unusual for the Supreme Court to step in and say: If someone’s going to strike down a major executive action, it ought to be the Supreme Court.

Tokyo’s First Female Governor Sails to Re-Election Even as Virus Cases Rise,2020-07-05,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — In rewarding Tokyo’s first female governor, Yuriko Koike, with a second term on Sunday, voters endorsed her highly visible leadership as the sprawling metropolis has avoided the kind of spiraling death toll from the coronavirus seen in other world capitals. But a recent resurgence in cases in Tokyo has made clear that her challenge is far from over. Even as Ms. Koike, 67, cruised to victory on Sunday, with exit polls by Japanese news media showing her winning 60 percent of the vote, Tokyo reported 111 new infections, its fourth straight day over 100. The creeping increase in cases has started to raise anxieties that the capital may have to reinstate elements of the nearly two-month state of emergency that it emerged from at the end of May. That growing caseload was felt in the election: About 15 percent of voters cast their ballots before Sunday, and turnout on Election Day was just above 37 percent. During the emergency period, in which the government issued voluntary requests for businesses to limit operations and residents to stay home, Ms. Koike made herself the face of Tokyo’s response to the virus. She anchored near-nightly news conferences to deliver daily test figures and advice on how to avoid infections. Ms. Koike presented a stark contrast to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who often appeared stiff in front of the news media. He was widely criticized when he posted an awkward video on Twitter showing himself at home drinking tea with his dog. Ms. Koike was a much more relaxed presence when she appeared in a jovial conversation with Japan’s most famous YouTube star, Hikakin. “Seeing her face on television every day made me feel comfortable,” Yuki Matsuura, 70, said as she voted in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo. “I think that she is doing the best that she can in a very difficult situation.” Ms. Koike said she was unlikely to request citywide business closings as she did during the earlier state of emergency. She said that she would prefer a “pinpointed” approach and that she wanted to establish a Tokyo version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 22 challengers vied for the post. Ms. Koike’s main rivals for the governor’s seat tried to differentiate themselves by staking out positions on further delaying, or even canceling, the Tokyo Olympics. Mr. Abe and the International Olympic Committee announced in March that the Games would be postponed from 2020 to 2021 because of the pandemic, and Ms. Koike has stuck to the official line. Same-sex partnerships were another dividing line in the race. All three of Ms. Koike’s most significant opponents expressed support for them: Kenji Utsunomiya, a former president of the Japan Bar Association who was backed by the country’s largest opposition parties, including the Communist Party; Taisuke Ono, a former adviser to the governor of Kumamoto in southern Japan; and Taro Yamamoto, a former actor and the head of a newly founded party. When asked about the issue during an online question session, Ms. Koike said she “didn’t know” whether she would support such a policy. The  victory on Sunday for Ms. Koike, an ultraconservative former defense minister who speaks English and Arabic, was something of a turnabout for her. Just a few years ago, she had seemed to have fallen out of favor with the public: In 2017, an upstart party she founded to challenge Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democratic Party in national elections took a drubbing, forcing her to admit “total defeat.” Until the pandemic, Ms. Koike’s record of achievements had been thin, and some of her decisions have drawn criticism. Not long after she was elected in 2016, she postponed a controversial move of Tokyo’s famous seafood market from its historic location in Tsukiji when it emerged that contaminants in the groundwater at a newly built site far exceeded environmental limits. But she went through with the move a year later even as tenants suspected that the metropolitan government had suppressed information about the safety of the new site. She also led an initiative to ban smoking in most indoor venues in Tokyo. Burnishing her credentials with hard-line conservatives, she was the first Tokyo governor to refuse during an annual ceremony to pay tribute to Koreans who died in a massacre after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. She also revoked a lease of public land to a new school for ethnic Korean residents, many descended from people who were brought to Japan as forced labor before and during World War II, when Japan occupied the Korean Peninsula. Surveys of employees of the metropolitan government, which oversees a region of 14 million people, indicate that she is far less popular among her city’s staff than she has been with voters. As an incumbent, Ms. Koike started with a considerable advantage, particularly given that the Japanese news media tends not to ask tough questions of candidates or investigate their records. The only thing that came close to a challenge to Ms. Koike were rumors that she had falsified her graduation from Cairo University in Egypt, prompting the Egyptian Embassy in Tokyo to post confirmation on its Facebook page that she had received a diploma. “The Japanese media likes scandals, but they don’t really do any serious policy review or anything that really affects our livelihood,” said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. The Japanese media “fails to inform us or fails to ask questions of the incumbents who have a huge advantage and owe us an explanation of their past record.” Ms. Koike has also managed to portray herself as a renegade. Although she started her political career as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party and served briefly as defense minister during Mr. Abe’s first term as prime minister, she has run for governor as an independent. Some analysts say she is more adept at political performance than actual policy. “She is very good at presenting catchy slogans or sound-bite phrases,” said Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor of political science at Hosei University in Tokyo. “I don’t think she has achieved substantive policies during her first term, but she often appears in television programs, especially after the outbreak of Covid-19, and she pretends to handle the problems.” Kazuhisa Tanaka, 63, who was voting in the Setagaya ward on Sunday afternoon, said he had cast his vote for the incumbent by default. “I don’t think that Koike has done the best job,” he said. “But who else would I vote for?” Hikari Hida, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']","Yuriko Koike has received high marks for her visible presence during the pandemic, but the coronavirus’s resurgence has raised anxiety in the Japanese capital."
Sorting Out Canada’s Patchwork of Face Mask Rules,2020-07-04,By Ian Austen,"['This year the hordes of visitors that usually flood into Ottawa for Canada Day were absent. A smattering of spectators near Parliament Hill watched as a man preached through a megaphone in a not entirely comprehensible mix of English and French. Nearby, a small crowd watched motorboats slowly making their way through the locks of the Rideau Canal, the closest thing to Canada Day entertainment. Most of those braving the coronavirus pandemic to join the festivities in the intense afternoon heat had one obvious thing in common. Few were wearing masks. Should they have been? Were they required to? In Canada, masks haven’t become as political or as contentious as they have in the United States. But in Canada mask policies have their own problems: rules that are inconsistent and sometimes unclear. With limited federal or provincial regulations, it’s mostly fallen on municipal governments and regional health agencies to set their own rules, resulting in a hodgepodge of poorly communicated policies. Good luck trying to sort them all out. The closest thing I found to a comprehensive resource was this map on the site of Masks4Canada, a group of doctors and medical researchers. Even so, it only covers Ontario. On Friday, the map showed 51 different municipalities in the province with rules governing masks. Toronto joined that list this week. As I wrote last week, you could be turned away for not wearing a mask at a service center along an Ontario expressway, only to find no such enforcement at an identical service center run by the same operator further down the highway. Dr. Amy Tan, a family physician and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Calgary medical school, spoke with me about what she and the other organizers of Masks4Canada want to see. “There’s a massive behavioral and culture shift that needs to happen,” she told me. “We’re really trying to say, as the economy reopens, we want you to do it as safely as possible, knowing that zero risk does not exist unless you continue with lockdowns.” “But we are not calling for continual lockdown,” she added. “We know the economy can’t deal with it, and we know there’s actually non-Covid health risks to continued lockdowns.” Her group wants to see the federal government and the provinces mandate masks in all public, indoor spaces including transit, as well as in crowds outdoors. So on Canada Day, the small number of people wandering around in front of the Parliament Buildings didn’t need masks but the cluster of people gathered around the Rideau Canal’s locks probably should have pulled them on. The time has come for Canadians to emulate Asia’s mask-wearing practices, said Sandra Hyde, an associate professor of anthropology and social studies of medicine at McGill University whose studies have included the spread of infectious diseases on that continent. “In China and in most of Asia, masks are seen as a courtesy that you do for the fellow people around you,” she told me this week. “A mask is not necessarily protecting you, it’s protecting the person next to you.” While Professor Hyde wears a masks indoors and on the crowded sidewalks of her Montreal neighborhood, she acknowledged that for many people they are “kind of a nuisance.” But she said there’s a lesson to be found in her studies of H.I.V. in China. “In the early days of H.I.V., there was a tremendous amount of creativity and marketing that went into making condoms acceptable.” In case you missed it, early in the pandemic Tara Parker-Pope produced a definitive mask handbook for The Times. [Read: A User’s Guide to Face Masks] Dr. Theresa Tam, the chief public health officer of Canada, and other Canadian officials initially didn’t recommend masks, but later reversed that position. Dr. Tan doesn’t want Canadians to get hung up on that. She said that the initial advice stemmed from concerns that a run on masks would leave health care providers without supplies, and that the reversal was linked to new research on the effectiveness of masks in this outbreak. “Just because the message has changed does not mean to not trust the message,” she said. “That messages change is actually what we expect in medicine and science. We just have never experienced it this quickly and this publicly in the past.” While many towns and cities have taken up the call by Dr. Tan’s group to require masks, she said that neither the federal government nor any provinces have formally responded. “Just because the economy has opened up again does not mean the risk is back to pre-Covid,” she said. “But people are unfortunately acting that way, and so we’ve been getting the word out that we need clear messaging.” “They shouldn’t have picked me,” Allan Adam, the leader of a Dene nation in Alberta who was punched and tackled by police officers over an expired license plate, told Catherine Porter. “They made a mistake.” He has survived the abusive residential schools system, battled governments and oil giants over the pollution of his traditional territory, and garnered the praise and admiration of Desmond Tutu, Greta Thunberg and celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio. The white-throated sparrow has changed its tune. And, yes, when it’s singing in Canada, the lyrics most definitely are “Oh-Sweet-Canada-Canada” and not, as the article indicates, “Old Sam Peabody-Peabody-Peabody.” The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or, as it’s known here, the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, came into effect on Canada Day. Ana Swanson, The Times’s Washington-based trade expert, writes that many of the deal’s requirements have not been fully met or will be phased in, some over several years.

Croatian Prime Minister’s Gamble on Early Elections Pays Off.,2020-07-05,By Joe Orovic and Patrick Kingsley,"['ZADAR, Croatia — Croatia’s ruling party finished first in a general election on Sunday despite ongoing criticism over the country’s recent handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic’s center-right party, the Croatian Democratic Union, has won more than 65 seats in Parliament. It was not enough for an outright majority, but with more than 90 percent of votes tallied, his party had at least 10 more seats than it held at the start of the campaign. Mr. Plenkovic called for early elections at the height of the pandemic in May, after his government was praised for its smooth management of the initial stages of the outbreak and his party edged ahead in opinion polls. But in the days before the vote, that decision started to look risky. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases began to spike, and polls showed Mr. Plenkovic ceding ground to his main rivals, a center-left alliance led by the Social Democratic Party.  Still, on Sunday, Mr. Plenkovic’s party emerged with one of its best showings in more than a decade. “The gamble paid off,” said Karlo Jurak, a political analyst and academic at the University of Zagreb. The strength of Mr. Plenkovic’s performance will make it easier for him to form a coalition with small centrist parties and parties representing ethnic minorities, analysts said. Mr. Plenkovic will also be less beholden to a new far-right group, the Homeland Movement, which has now entered parliament for the first time and is led by the pop singer Miroslav Skoro. Though the Homeland Movement was projected to win about 15 seats, making it the third-largest in parliament, it no longer seemed likely that Mr. Plenkovic would need its support to form a coalition. Voters opted for stability amid a profound health and economic crisis, said Dejan Jovic, a political scientist at the University of Zagreb. “It looks like the electorate sees the coming difficulties and want some center-right government to lead the country,” he said. Throughout Mr. Plenkovic’s four years in power, his government was plagued by scandal: Nine ministers left office for reasons related to corruption. But during the campaign, Mr. Plenkovic successfully diverted attention from graft by centering his re-election bid on Croatia’s strong coronavirus response, which at one point was among the strictest in the world. “Croatia and this government defeated Covid-19,” Mr. Plenkovic said at a press briefing in May. But as the campaign wore on and social restrictions eased, his strategy seemed set to backfire. In the two weeks before the election, daily coronavirus cases in Croatia rose above 50, mirroring rates at the height of the crisis in April. As cases climbed, Mr. Plenkovic’s rivals — and some of his allies — suggested that the election be postponed in the interest of public health. Attempting to ward off those concerns, the election authority briefly barred confirmed coronavirus patients from participating. But the country’s Constitutional Court later reversed the ban, allowing patients to vote by proxy. And just as support for both the center-left and far-right began to rise, Mr. Plenkovic was criticized for endorsing an exhibition tennis tournament organized in Zadar, a seaside town, by Novak Djokovic, the world’s No. 1 tennis player. The tournament was meant to stir interest in Croatia’s holiday vacation locations, boosting the country’s beleaguered tourism industry, a key part of its economy. It ended in embarrassment, for both Mr. Djokovic and Mr. Plenkovic. Crowds at the event did not have to wear masks or follow social distancing rules. Several participants contracted the virus, including Mr. Djokovic himself, forcing a premature end to the tournament and undermining Mr. Plenkovic’s victorious coronavirus narrative. Mr. Plenkovic was accused of hypocrisy after fist-bumping Mr. Djokovic and then refusing to enter quarantine, which critics felt contravened the government’s own guidelines for curbing the spread of the disease. And when Mr. Plenkovic was defended by members of the group overseeing Croatia’s virus response, the experts of the group were accused of politicizing public health. The decision created a “double standard,” said Mr. Jurak, the political analyst. But on Sunday, Mr. Plenkovic’s base nevertheless appeared to have kept faith in the prime minister and his party, Mr. Jurak said. “Plenkovic timed the vote correctly.” Joe Orovic reported from Zadar and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.']","Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic ran a risky campaign based on his government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. It paid off, with his party’s best showing in more than a decade."
Phoenix Mayor Says FEMA Refused to Help With Testing,2020-07-05,,"['This briefing has ended. Read live coronavirus updates here. Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix said on Sunday that with cases and death counts soaring in Arizona, testing sites in her city and surrounding Maricopa County are overwhelmed, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency has rebuffed her pleas for help. She raised the issue on the ABC program “This Week,” saying that it “feels like they’re declaring victory while we’re in crisis mode.” In an interview later in the day, Ms. Gallego, a Democrat, said she had been trying since April to get more testing resources for Phoenix, both from FEMA and from the private sector. But testing, she says, remains woefully inadequate, especially for those who lack health insurance. “We are the largest city not to have received this type of investment,” Ms. Gallego said, noting that FEMA had set up testing sites in Houston, Los Angeles and elsewhere. “And you can see it in the increasing rate of positives.” More than 20 percent of tests in Arizona are coming back positive now, she said. “Public health officials tell me that when you’re doing the appropriate amount of testing, it should be around 2 percent,” she said. An aide to the mayor said that FEMA had responded to the city’s most recent request by saying the agency was “getting out of the testing business.” Maricopa County officials were told the same thing when they asked FEMA for help, the mayor said. Cases have doubled in Arizona in recent weeks; more than 3,400 new cases were announced Sunday. The state marked a record on Saturday with 3,182 confirmed and suspected virus hospitalizations. “I hope they understand what it’s like out here,” Mayor Gallego said.  “I wish I could have the president with me as people fill their cars with gas so they can wait in lines for eight hours, while they’re sick and it’s 110 degrees outside,” to get a test. “This is not just a Phoenix problem,” she said. “I think many communities and people across both parties would like to see the federal government play a role.” Vice President Mike Pence, who visited Phoenix on Wednesday, said last week that testing was readily available to anyone in the country who needed it.  An administration official said the federal government is working to resolve Arizona’s need for testing supplies and that the city should work through the state to get the help it needs. “We do have one hopeful note,” Ms. Gallego said Sunday afternoon. After she raised the issue on TV, she said, “The White House reached out and said they’re interested in more information, and would try to see what they can do.”  Public health experts and officials on Sunday disputed President’s Trump’s characterization of the seriousness of the coronavirus. In an Independence Day speech on Saturday at the White House, Mr. Trump sought to dismiss widespread criticism of his administration’s slow and ineffective response to the virus. He repeated his false claim that an abundance of testing made the country’s cases look worse than they were, and he asserted that 99 percent of the nation’s cases were “totally harmless.” Cases have risen steeply in recent weeks, and infections announced across the United States last week totaled more than 330,000 — a record high that included the five highest single-day totals of the pandemic. On Sunday, more than 40,000 new cases had been announced nationally by evening. On Sunday, the former F.D.A. commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said that “certainly more than 1 percent of people get serious illness” if they are infected. Speaking on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” he estimated that when all cases were counted, including asymptomatic ones, between 2 and 5 percent of infected people become sick enough to require hospitalization. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, sidestepped repeated questions about that statement on three television news shows. “I’m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong,” he said at one point. Dr. Hahn told CNN’s Dana Bash that it’s “too early to tell” if it’s safe for Republicans to hold their convention in Jacksonville, Fla., next month. “We’ll have to see how this unfolds in Florida and elsewhere around the country,” he said. Even some Republicans pushed back at the president’s assertions. “The virus is not harmless,” Miami’s mayor, Carlos Giménez, said on “Face the Nation,” noting that positivity rates in Miami-Dade County — the share of coronavirus tests that come back positive — were now above 20 percent. Florida has reached record highs for new cases several times in the past 10 days, reporting more than 11,400 new cases on Saturday alone, according to a New York Times database. More than 10,000 new cases were announced in Florida on Sunday, and the state has now had over 200,000 total cases. Mr. Trump and other administration officials have also highlighted the country’s declining death rate. Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said improvements in care may have caused the decline, but also described deaths as a “lagging indicator.” “By the time somebody gets infected, it takes a couple weeks before they get hospitalized and get really sick, and another week or 10 days before they die, ” he said. He also said that many of the people now being infected were younger adults and less likely to develop severe illness. Studies that have calculated the death rate based on broader antibody testing that takes silent cases into consideration suggest an infection death rate of less than 1 percent, Dr. Jha said. “It’s always tricky to do this in the midst of a pandemic,” Dr. Jha said. “There are a lot of factors that go into it. But let’s say you took 1,000 Americans at random who were all infected. Our best guess is that between six and 10 would likely die of the virus.” And the death rate does not capture all of the harm caused by the disease. As many as 15 to 20 percent of known Covid-19 patients may require hospitalization, and of the group admitted, 15 to 20 percent are transferred into intensive care, according to some estimates. And many who have recovered are still struggling to regain their pre-disease lives, and may face long-term health issues.   Hospitals in Austin, Texas, could be “overrun” within two weeks if current trends hold, Mayor Steve Adler warned on Sunday. “If we don’t change the trajectory, we are within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun,” the mayor said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” He said intensive care units could fill up even sooner, perhaps within 10 days. Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, issued the same two-week warning in an appearance on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” noting that roughly one in four virus tests in the city was now positive and that the demand for testing was exceeding capacity. The virus is spreading rapidly in Texas, one of the first states to lift stay-at-home orders and reopen businesses. It has broken daily records for new cases several times in the past week. More than 195,000 cases have been identified over the course of the pandemic in the state, which hit a single-day high on Wednesday with more than 8,100 new cases. Texas broke another record over the weekend with 8,181 patients hospitalized as of Sunday. Travis County, Austin’s home, has confirmed more than 11,000 cases since the pandemic began, according to a database maintained by The New York Times. Harris County, Houston’s home, has reported 35,913. But the virus has moved beyond Texas’ generally liberal cities, reaching into the deep-red regions of the state that have resisted aggressive public health regulation. In Lubbock, more people tested positive in the last three weeks than in the previous three months combined. Two months ago, on the day that Gov. Greg Abbott began to reopen the state, the city recorded eight positive tests. On Wednesday, there were 184. Mayor Adler said that the most important thing about the order Governor Abbott signed on Thursday making masks mandatory in most counties was that people would now be getting the same guidance from both state and local officials. “It’s the messaging,” he said. “It’s the singular voice from both parties saying to our community, ‘This is important, you have to do it, it works.’” Many conservative Texans do not share that view, including some of the state’s top leaders. On Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick declared himself tired of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor. “I don’t need his advice anymore,” Mr. Patrick said. That sentiment was echoed outside a popular, newly opened hamburger restaurant in Wolfforth, just outside Lubbock, where even Mr. Abbott, a Republican, came under harsh criticism. “It seems like he’s been influenced by Fauci and the left,” Mark Stewart said. But in the biggest cities in Texas, Governor Abbott’s directives don’t go far enough. “I’m sure a mask order will make some difference, and I’m grateful that that’s happened now,” Judge Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat who is effectively the chief executive of Harris County, said on the ABC program “This Week.” “That said, as long as we’re doing as little as possible and hoping for the best, we’re always going to be chasing this thing, we’re always going to be behind.” Some Texans are worried about a political event on the horizon: The executive committee of the state’s Republican Party voted on Thursday to go ahead with an in-person convention in Houston next week. In response, the Texas Medical Association said it would withdraw from the event as an advertiser. “With or without masks, an indoor gathering of thousands of people from all around the state in a city with tens of thousands of active COVID-19 cases poses a significant health risk,” the organization’s president, Dr. Diana L. Fite, said in a statement on Friday. Even Mr. Patrick said that holding an in-person convention in Houston was not a good idea, citing the risks of exposing people to Covid-19. But he added that he respected the vote of the committee. “I will be there,” he said in a statement in Friday. Early numbers had shown that Black and Latino people were being harmed by the coronavirus at higher rates, but new federal data — made available after The New York Times sued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — reveals a clearer and more complete picture: Black and Latino people have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus in a widespread manner that spans the country, throughout hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups. Latino and African-American residents of the United States have been three times as likely to become infected as their white neighbors, according to the new data, which provides detailed characteristics of 640,000 infections detected in nearly 1,000 U.S. counties. And Black and Latino people have been nearly twice as likely to die from the virus as white people, the data shows. The disparities persist across state lines and regions. They exist in rural towns on the Great Plains, in suburban counties, like Fairfax County, Va., and in many of the country’s biggest cities. “Systemic racism doesn’t just evidence itself in the criminal justice system,” said Quinton Lucas, who is the third Black mayor of Kansas City, Mo., which is in a state where 40 percent of those infected are Black or Latino even though those groups make up just 16 percent of the state’s population. “It’s something that we’re seeing taking lives in not just urban America, but rural America, and all types of parts where, frankly, people deserve an equal opportunity to live — to get health care, to get testing, to get tracing.” Global Roundup As the Iranian government battles a new wave of the virus, the authorities have, for first time since the pandemic began, ordered citizens to cover their faces in public. The new rules took effect on Sunday. A day earlier, President Hassan Rouhani urged businesses to refuse service to customers not wearing masks. And he said any government employee who showed up at work without one would be sent home and marked down as absent for the day. In Tehran, the capital, municipal officials said the police, security forces and public transportation authorities would crack down on people violating the mask rule. On Sunday, Iran marked its highest number of deaths, 163 people, from the virus in a single day since the pandemic started, according to the health ministry. Eighteen of the country’s 31 provinces are on a state of high alert for Covid-19, with nine declared as red zones, a spokeswoman for the ministry said. A doctor overseeing pandemic patients at Tehran’s designated hospital for the disease said all the beds there were full. But it remains to be seen if Iranians will adhere to the new rules. Iran briefly imposed a lockdown during its annual New Year holiday period in early April and opened the country for business in early May. Since then, the majority of Iranians have resumed ordinary life — and then some. While large gatherings such as weddings and funerals were still considered prohibited, a lavish Cinderella-themed wedding in the Lavasan hills near Tehran drew the ire of local officials. There were said to be 120 actors and 65 employees of the wedding hall re-enacting the fairy tale. The health ministry said the groom had been arrested. In other news around the world: Officials in India canceled a planned reopening of the Taj Mahal this week, dealing a setback to hopes that welcoming visitors back to monuments would boost local tourism until international flights resume. India’s coronavirus infections started to rapidly rise several weeks ago when the government began lifting a nationwide lockdown imposed in March, and some cities have already reinstated tough rules to keep their caseloads down. India has reported about 700,000 confirmed infections and nearly 20,000 deaths as of Monday. People crossing into Mexico from Lukeville, Ariz., over the weekend hit a roadblock briefly put up on the main road leading south from the border by residents fearful of the virus, The Associated Press reported. An inspection checkpoint set up near the border crossing will continue to operate to “safeguard the health of our community,” a local mayor, José Ramos Arzate, said in a statement. He noted that Arizona has an “accelerated rate of Covid-19 contagion,” and said people from the United States should be allowed in only for “essential matters.” In rewarding Tokyo’s first female governor, Yuriko Koike, with a second term on Sunday, voters appeared to be endorsing her highly visible leadership during the pandemic. The sprawling metropolis has avoided the kind of death toll seen in other big cities. But a recent resurgence in cases in Tokyo has made clear that her challenge is far from over. Even as Ms. Koike, 67, cruised to victory on Sunday, with exit polls by the Japanese news media showing her winning 60 percent of the vote, Tokyo reported 111 new infections, its fourth straight day over 100. Croatia’s ruling party came first in a general election on Sunday despite criticism over the country’s recent handling of the pandemic. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic’s center-right party, the Croatian Democratic Union, had its best showing in more than a decade.  A military plane carrying Canadian troops to Latvia as part of a NATO mission turned around midflight after the military learned that someone who might have come in contact with the passengers tested had positive for the virus. About 70 passengers and aircrew members were on board the flight Thursday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. More than six months into the pandemic, the coronavirus has infected more than 11 million people worldwide, killing more than 525,000. But despite the increasing toll, scientists still do not have a clear answer to one of the most fundamental questions about the virus: How deadly is it? A firm estimate could help governments predict how many deaths would ensue if the virus spread out of control. The figure, usually called the infection fatality rate, could tell health officials what to expect as the pandemic spreads in densely populated nations like Brazil, India and Nigeria. In poorer countries,  the number could help officials decide whether to spend more on oxygen concentrators and ventilators, or on measles shots and mosquito nets. At present, countries have very different case fatality rates, which measure deaths among patients known to have had Covid-19. In most cases, that number is highest in countries that have had the virus the longest. According to data gathered by The New York Times, China had reported 90,294 cases as of Friday and 4,634 deaths, a case fatality rate of 5 percent. The United States, which has had a record number of new daily cases six times in the past two weeks, has had 2,811,447 cases and 129,403 deaths, about 4.6 percent. Ten sizable countries, most in Western Europe, have tested bigger percentages of their populations than the United States has. Their case fatality rates vary wildly: Iceland’s is less than 1 percent, New Zealand’s and Israel’s are below 2 percent. Belgium, by comparison, is at 16 percent, and Italy and Britain are at 14 percent. Before last week, the World Health Organization had no official estimate for the infection fatality rate. Instead, it had relied on a mix of data sent in by member countries and academic groups, and on a meta-analysis done in May by scientists at the University of Wollongong and James Cook University in Australia. Those researchers looked at 267 studies in more than a dozen countries and then chose the 25 they considered the most accurate, weighting them for accuracy, and averaged the data. They concluded that the global infection fatality rate was 0.64 percent. That percentage of the world’s population equals 47 million people, including two million Americans. Other recent scientific developments: In an open letter to the W.H.O. to be published next week, 239 scientists in 32 countries are urging the agency to recognize that the virus can infect people through tiny aerosolized particles, not just larger respiratory droplets expelled by infected people in coughs and sneezes. A six-gene segment of the human genome that increases the risk of severe illness from the coronavirus was inherited from Neanderthals, according to a new study. The variant is common in Bangladesh, and may explain why Covid-19 patients of Bangladeshi descent are dying at a high rate in Britain. Only 8 percent of Europeans carry it, and it is almost completely absent in Africa. Researchers reported new evidence that a variant of the virus that has come to predominate in much of the world did so partly because it is more transmissible than other variants. The variant carries a mutation that stabilizes the virus’s spike proteins, which it uses to infect human cells. While the report notes that the findings aren’t definitive, the lead author, Bette Korber, a theoretical biologist, said, “It is the dominant virus in the world, it only took about a month for that to happen, and it’s now the one we should be looking at.” The Australian state of Victoria has locked down nine public housing towers in Melbourne, its capital, telling about 3,000 residents that they must not leave their homes for any reason for at least five days. The strict quarantine — which is the first of its kind in Australia during the pandemic and is being monitored by hundreds of police officers — started immediately on Saturday afternoon after 23 coronavirus infections were found in 12 of the towers’ households. Public health officials said everyone in the towers would be tested over the next few days. “There is a lot of intermingling of the people between those towers for work, for family, for community events,” said Dr. Paul Kelly, Australia’s acting chief medical officer. He called the towers “vertical cruise ships” with the potential to cause a major surge in cases at a time when Australia’s infections are already rising because of an outbreak across several Melbourne suburbs. Some residents of the towers objected to being quarantined without notice. Abdi Ibrahim, who lives there with his five children, including 7-month-old twins, told The Australian that the lockdown had been imposed so quickly that it gave him no time to buy groceries for his family. He also had to cancel his Sunday shift at a logistics company. “If I don’t work, I don’t get paid,” he said, adding: “We are so isolated — you know what I mean, it’s like a prison.” Officials said they would provide tower residents with food, cash compensation and rent relief. As the towers were being locked down, officials also added two more Melbourne postal codes to the 10 others already under stay-at-home orders, affecting a total of more than 300,000 people. Unlike residents of the towers, people in these areas are allowed to leave their homes for work or education, exercise, medical care, caregiving or shopping for essential supplies. Australia’s total case count remains relatively small, but public health officials have become increasingly alarmed by the outbreak in Melbourne. About 200 new cases emerged in and around the city over the past two days, a growth rate not seen since March. In rewarding Tokyo’s first female governor, Yuriko Koike, with a second term on Sunday, voters endorsed her highly visible leadership as the sprawling metropolis has avoided the kind of spiraling death toll from the coronavirus seen in other world capitals. But a recent resurgence in cases in Tokyo has made clear that her challenge is far from over. Even as Ms. Koike, 67, cruised to victory on Sunday, with exit polls by the Japanese news media showing her winning 60 percent of the vote, Tokyo reported 111 new infections, its fourth straight day over 100. The creeping increase in cases has started to raise anxieties that the capital may have to reinstate elements of the nearly two-month state of emergency that it emerged from at the end of May. That growing caseload was felt in the election on Sunday, as voter turnout dipped below 35 percent. During the emergency period, in which the government issued voluntary requests for businesses to limit operations and residents to stay home, Ms. Koike made herself the face of Tokyo’s response to the virus. She anchored near nightly news conferences to deliver daily test figures and advice on how to avoid infections. In contrast to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who often appeared stiff in front of the news media, Ms. Koike was a much more relaxed presence when she appeared in conversation with Japan’s most famous YouTube star, Hikakin. “Seeing her face on television every day made me feel comfortable,” Yuki Matsuura, 70, said as she voted in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo. “I think that she is doing the best that she can in a very difficult situation.” Some survivors of Covid-19 have a long road to recovery even after discharged from the hospital, and the illness can leave long-lasting effects that are just beginning to be recognized and understood. It is still too early to know the trajectory for these patients, but scientists are beginning research that could predict those effects, and have an impact on how doctors treat the illness. In Britain, the National Institute for Health Research, the University of Leicester and university hospitals in the city of Leicester have started a study of about 10,000 patients, which the university says makes it the largest of its kind in the world. “As we continue our fight against this global pandemic, we are learning more and more about the impact the disease can have not only on immediate health, but longer-term physical and mental health too,” Matt Hancock, the health secretary said, in a statement on Sunday. Chris Brightling, a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester and chief investigator for the study, said that “it is vitally important that we rapidly gather evidence on the longer-term consequences of contracting severe Covid-19 so we can develop and test new treatment strategies for them and other people affected by future waves of the disease.” Mr. Hancock told the BBC on Sunday that long-term effects are a “really serious problem for a minority of people who’ve had Covid, thankfully not me,” describing them as a “post-viral fatigue syndrome.” Since the dawn of cinema, Italy’s torrid summers have made outdoor movie showings under the stars a favorite entertainment choice of the season. But this year, several nonprofit cultural and social organizations have struggled to get their summer film festivals going after film distributors refused to rent them many requested titles, from the Harry Potter series to “BlacKkKlansman” to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The reason? These nonprofit organizations screen films for free, even as Italy’s fabled film industry is reeling with many theaters closed because of the virus. “The distributors told us that if we show them for free, they can’t give us films,” said Luca Sansone of the Laboratorio di Quartiere Giambellino Lorenteggio. The shows free films in a Milanese low-income neighborhood “where people don’t go to the movies because it costs too much,” he said. Those in the business say that the pandemic dealt such a blow that it put the survival of Italy’s film industry at risk, and that giving unfettered free access to films would only make matters worse. “We lost more than 30 million tickets and more than 200 million euros in takings, just in box office receipts,” said Mario Lorini, president of an association of cinema owners. Cinemas were given the green light to reopen on June 15, but only 540 have done so. New safety and social distancing guidelines limit such indoor spaces to 200 people, and many cinema owners say they cannot break even under such rules. How much more cautious is Wales than England when it comes to lockdown? Try buying a drink in Llanymynech, which straddles the English-Welsh border. For a small village, there is an impressive selection of pubs, three in all, but choose wisely if you want a pint: Only two of them — those on the English side of the border — can serve customers. “It is ridiculous,” John Turner, owner of the still-shuttered Dolhin Inn, said over a beer at a rival pub across the boundary line, “but there’s got to be a border at some point. It just so happens we are on it.” England allowed restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen on Saturday after more than 100 days of lockdown. That was good news for fully two-thirds of the pubs in Llanymynech. But the Welsh government has delayed pub openings until July 13 — and even then is allowing drinking only in gardens or other outdoor spaces. The rules are different because the Welsh government in Cardiff has power over issues like health, education and public administration. And like Scotland, Wales has generally taken a more cautious approach to virus controls than England has, keeping travel restrictions in place, for example, and waiting longer to open nonessential shops. Wales plans to reopen the hospitality trade more slowly, partly in light of criticism from some scientists that England is taking an unnecessary risk by opening pubs, restaurants and many other businesses at the same time — and on a Saturday, when people tend to drink more. An estimated 22,000 seasonal workers tend and harvest crops in New Jersey, nicknamed the Garden State for its robust agriculture industry. Many of these laborers follow the ripening crops up the Eastern Seaboard, starting in Florida, where migrant living quarters have been ravaged by the coronavirus, and working their way north to Maine. Making life even more perilous, they have been deemed essential workers — exempt from stay-at-home orders and a 14-day quarantine rule in New Jersey for people coming from states where the virus is spreading quickly. Each influx of workers brings the risk of a fresh outbreak. Barring rain, they work seven days a week. In New Jersey, 3,900 farmworkers had been tested as of Thursday and 193 were positive for the virus, according to the state’s Department of Health. Of these, 14 who had nowhere to remain isolated were placed into quarantine at a state-run field hospital at the Atlantic City Convention Center. “It’s a little dangerous,” said Felix Nieves, 56, a supervisor at Atlantic Blueberry Company in Hammonton. The 1,300-acre farm is considered the biggest blueberry producer in the Northeast. The first round of testing at Atlantic Blueberry was done early in the season, before most workers arrived. Three of the first 56 people tested were found to have the virus. Atlantic Blueberry purchased 3,000 bandannas and gave each worker two — one to wear, one to wash — and hung fire-retardant cloth between beds in the dormitories where hundreds of laborers live during the season. The farm also bought additional buses to create extra space on the shuttles that run to and from the fields. “Farming never stops,” Mr. Nieves said. “The fruit will not wait for this to pass.” Alarmed at China’s stranglehold over supplies of masks, gowns, test kits and other essential tools for tackling the coronavirus, countries around the world have set up their own factories to cope with both this pandemic and future ones. When the outbreak subsides, those factories may struggle to survive. But China has laid the groundwork to dominate the market for protective and medical supplies for years to come. Before the pandemic, China was already exporting more respirators, surgical masks, medical goggles and protective garments than the rest of the world combined, the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated. Beijing’s coronavirus response has only added to that dominance. It increased mask production nearly 12-fold in February alone. It can now make 150 tons per day of the specialized fabric used for masks, said Bob McIlvaine, who runs a research and consulting firm in Northfield, Ill. That is 15 times the output of U.S. companies even after they ramped up production this spring. “The Chinese have been successful weaving global personal protection equipment dominance with supply-chain command and control,” said Omar Allam, a former Canadian trade official trying to establish production of in-demand N95 medical respirators in his country. American companies have been reluctant to make big investments in fabric manufacturing because they worry that demand for masks will be temporary. Yet officials across the country are increasingly calling for the wearing of face coverings in public. “It is a huge mistake,” Mr. McIlvaine said, “to assume that the market will disappear.” Two hours by boat from the seaside town of Lowestoft on the east coast of England, over 100 giant windmills loom more than 500 feet above the sea. High atop the new towers, technicians in red-and-black protective suits have been working to hook them up to the British power system. Britain has been under various stages of lockdown since March. But work on this wind farm, called East Anglia One, has charged ahead. Contractors rented holiday cabins and reached agreements with hotels near Lowestoft, the operations base, so that they could house some of the offshore workers there and keep them isolated. Workers were taken out by boats to the wind farm for 12-hour day and night shifts. Producers of clean energy are pushing hard to get their projects up and running; they want to make money on their investments as soon as possible. And while the virus has reduced demand for electricity overall — the oil and gas industry in particular has been rocked by plummeting prices — renewable power tends to win out over polluting energy sources because of low costs and favorable regulatory rules. The green energy industry suffered major setbacks during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. But analysts say that businesses have consolidated since then, and the industry has continued to bring down costs. The turbines at East Anglia One are 15 times as powerful as those installed in the first offshore wind farms almost 30 years ago, and so they produce much more revenue per unit. “The outlook for renewables looks really quite resilient, despite all the Covid restrictions,” said Sam Arie, a utilities analyst at UBS, an investment bank. “We have seen a few companies with minor interruptions,” he added. “But relative to other sectors the impacts here have been very limited.” When it’s time to invite people over or arrange a play date, hosts face tough conversations with friends, neighbors and family on their standards for avoiding coronavirus infection.

"Russia Denies Paying Bounties, but Some Say the U.S. Had It Coming",2020-07-03,By Andrew Higgins and Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Three years into a grinding war in eastern Ukraine, the Trump administration, in a sharp break with Obama-era policy, proposed providing the Ukrainian army with potent American weapons, Javelin anti-tank missiles, to aid its struggle with Russian-backed separatists. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia responded with an ominous warning, saying weapons in the separatist regions could easily be sent “to other zones of conflict” — which many took to mean Afghanistan. Russia’s grievances against what it sees as American bullying and expansion into its own zones of influence have been stacking up for decades, starting with the C.I.A.’s role in arming mujahedin fighters who, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, delivered a fatal blow not only to the invading Red Army but the entire Soviet Union. A deep well of bitterness created by past and current conflicts in Afghanistan, Ukraine and more recently Syria, where U.S. forces killed scores of Russian mercenaries in 2018, help explain why Russia, according to U.S. intelligence officials, has become so closely entangled with the Taliban. In Ukraine, the Trump administration did send Javelins but with the stipulation that they not be used in the war. Russian officials and commentators reacted with fury to a report last week in The New York Times that American intelligence officials had concluded that Russia’s military intelligence agency had gone so far as to pay bounties to the Taliban and criminal elements linked to it to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. Intercepted electronic data showed large financial transfers from Russia’s military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U., to a Taliban-linked account, according to American officials. Officials also identified an Afghan contractor as a key middleman between the G.R.U. and militants linked to the Taliban who carried out the attacks. Russian officials have scoffed at the idea they would hire killers from a radical Islamist group that is banned in Russia as a “terrorist” outfit and that shares many views of the Afghan fighters who killed so many Red Army soldiers, and those of Islamic militants who caused Moscow so much pain in Chechnya during two wars there. In remarks to a state news agency on Monday, Zamir Kabulov, Mr. Putin’s special envoy for Afghanistan and a former ambassador in Kabul, dismissed the Taliban bounties report as “outright lies” generated by “forces in the United States who don’t want to leave Afghanistan and want to justify their own failures.” Amid a torrent of outraged denials, however, there have been pointed reminders that, in Russia’s view, the United States, because of its overreach overseas, deserves to taste some of its own medicine. Speaking during a talk show on state television dominated by conspiracy theories about plots by President Trump’s Democratic rivals, Aleksei Zhuravlyov, a member of the Russian Parliament, reminded viewers that as far as Russia was concerned, the United States has long had it coming. Recalling Operation Cyclone, the C.I.A.’s secret program to arm Moscow’s enemies in Afghanistan during the 1980s, Mr. Zhuravlyov said the United States had spent billions of dollars on weapons that“killed thousands and thousands” of Russians. “This is a medical fact.” While dismissing reports of Russian bounties for American scalps as “fake news,” he said, “Let’s suppose we paid” the Taliban, and then asked how many Americans had perhaps been killed as a result. “At most 22,” he responded. There is no evidence to date that Mr. Putin signed off on any program to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even independent experts say they strongly doubt he would have done so. Yet, Russia under Mr. Putin has for years throbbed with real and imagined pain from hurt inflicted by the United States, notably the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a desire to make it pay. Andrei Serenko, an expert at the Center for the Study of Contemporary Afghanistan in Moscow, said Russia has no real desire to see the United States leave Afghanistan and revels in America’s agonies from an endless conflict he described as a “sore blister for the United States.” All the same, he said, Russia has been preparing for an eventual pullout by cultivating ties to the Taliban as well as to various Afghan warlords. It has done this with money and other inducements in the hope of shaping future Afghan events and securing a useful instrument to poke Washington. The Taliban, like many other Afghan groups, he added, has a long record of running protection rackets and taking cash from foreigners, including Russians, Americans and Chinese. “This is what they do,” he said. “They are Afghanistan’s most successful business.” Russia, he said, “decided that if we can create lots of problems for Americans in Afghanistan, they will create fewer problems for us in Ukraine and Syria.” Moscow has been reaching out to the Taliban for years, starting in 1995 when Mr. Kabulov traveled to Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold in the south, to negotiate the release of Russian pilots who had been taken hostage. The pilots eventually got away with their aircraft in what was described at the time as a daring escape. But what really happened is unclear. One thing that seems certain, however, is that this first Russian negotiation with the Taliban revolved around money. “Everything was based on money,” Vasily Kravtsov, a former K.G.B. officer during the Soviet war and until 2018 a Russian diplomat in Kabul, recalled of the hostage talks. Mr. Kravtsov denied that Russia had since paid the Taliban bounties for the deaths of coalition soldiers, even as he recalled that Soviet soldiers had been killed in large numbers by American arms supplied to the mujahedin. He said he himself had been wounded twice by weapons “bought with American funds.” Igor Yerin, who fought in Afghanistan as a young Red Army conscript in the 1980s, said he never saw any Americans on the battlefield but “they were everywhere because of their Stingers.” Stingers were antiaircraft missiles provided to mujahedin fighters by the United States as part of a covert C.I.A. program. They enabled the mujahedin to shoot down hundreds of Soviet planes and helicopters, turning the tide in the decade-long war. Now the curator of a small museum in Moscow commemorating the inglorious Afghan war, Mr. Yerin showed off a display of land mines and other weapons sent to kill Russians as part of the C.I.A. program. Mr. Putin has for years played on this and other sources of Russian pain. Soon after coming to power two decades ago, he pledged support for former President George W. Bush in his “with or against us” war on terrorism in 2001, and cooperated with America’s drive to oust the Taliban. But he quickly soured on the idea that Washington could be a reliable partner and began blaming it for most of the world’s problems. Bristling with wounded pride, Mr. Putin in a fiery speech in Munich in 2007 denounced what he said was a “world of one master, one sovereign” and complained that the “United States has overstepped its national borders, in every area.” He has been settling scores ever since, often with help from the G.R.U., which even before Mr. Putin took power had won its spurs putting the United States in its place. Since he took office, the military intelligence agency has been accused of involvement in widespread mischief-making, from a bungled 2016 coup attempt in Montenegro aimed at preventing the Balkan nation’s entry into NATO, to meddling the same year in the U.S. presidential election. In a rare recent interview, the former head of the G.R.U., Valentin Korabelnikov, told state television how his officers had in 1999 organized a frantic dash by Russian troops and armor to Kosovo to occupy the airport in the capital, Pristina — just hours before the arrival of NATO forces. The stunt, he said, was “about the prestige of our state” and showing that Russia could not be ignored. Speaking in his former office at the headquarters of the G.R.U. in Moscow, Mr. Korabelnikov said that his agency had organized many other secret operations but that those could not be revealed. “The vast majority of operations carried out both by us and our brothers,” he said, referring to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service and the Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B. and headed in the late 1990s by Mr. Putin, “are completely closed, and only the small tip of the iceberg sometimes appears.” Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia’s security apparatus who wrote a doctorate on Moscow’s disastrous Afghan war, said “some old war horses” in the G.R.U. could have hatched a scheme to kill Americans as payback for Russians killed with American weapons in Afghanistan. But he said he doubted that such a plan would have been approved by the Russian leadership or executed without approval as a “maverick operation.” Even Mr. Yerin, the former conscript — who lost friends in Afghanistan — recalled that during his tour there, spent mostly near the northern city of Kunduz, he never believed political commissars in his unit who explained the 1979 Soviet invasion was necessary to keep the United States from moving into Russia’s back yard. “Today, I believe them,” Mr. Yerin said. “Afghanistan is our next-door neighbor,” he said, stabbing with his finger the southern border of the former Soviet Union on a big wall map, “What happens here is our business, not the Americans’.” Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.']",Russia’s grievances against what it sees as American bullying and expansion into its own zones of influence have been stacking up for decades.
Turkey Convicts Human Rights Activists on Terror Charges,2020-07-03,By Megan Specia,"['A Turkish court on Friday convicted four human rights activists of terrorism charges, including two former leaders of Amnesty International, as part of a broader crackdown on opposition voices in the country. One defendant, Taner Kilic, who once led Amnesty Turkey, a top human rights watchdog, was convicted on charges of being a member of a terrorist organization and sentenced to six years and three months in prison. Three others — Ozlem Dalkiran, Idil Eser and Gunal Kursun — were convicted of “assisting a terrorist organization” and each sentenced to 25 months in jail. Their cases are the latest in a widespread crackdown on dissent in Turkey in the wake of a failed 2016 coup attempt. The crackdown has seen hundreds put on trial and deepened political divisions within the country. While the government accused the group of terrorism, critics say the trials are part of an arbitrary system under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that has targeted human rights defenders with baseless accusations and used the justice system to close down civil society activism.  The prosecution maintained that those on trial are connected to Fethullah Gulen, a cleric accused of having organized the plot to overthrow Turkey’s government from his base in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen has denied any involvement and has accused Mr. Erdogan of orchestrating it as an excuse to seize more power. The four convicted on Friday spent three years fighting the charges. As no detention orders have yet been issued, they will not be imprisoned pending their appeals, and the appeals process could take years. Seven other defendants who were also on trial were acquitted on Friday. In a statement, Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s Turkey researcher, called the convictions a “travesty of justice of spectacular proportions.” “This verdict is a crushing blow not only for Taner, Ozlem, İdil and Gunal and their families but for everyone who believes in justice, and human rights activism in Turkey and beyond,” he said. Idil Eser, who was once the director of Amnesty’s Turkey office, was detained in 2017 in a raid on a digital security workshop in Istanbul alongside several other activists who ended up on trial. Mr. Kilic was arrested separately a month earlier in the city of Izmir and was held in prison for nearly a year and a half before being released late last year under court orders. A day before the sentencing, Ms. Eser called the trial politically motivated from the start and said it was intended to intimidate other activists. “These prosecutions aim to silence those in the dock and send a message to the rest of society: fight for human rights or speak the truth at your peril,” she said in a statement. Human rights experts say the convictions signaled an erosion of civil society in Turkey. Mary Lawlor, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights defenders, said in a statement that the evidence introduced to support the charges “has yet to clearly demonstrate how their activities amounted to terrorism.” “They should never have been prosecuted,” Ms. Lawlor wrote in a post on Twitter following the decision.']","The cases are part of a widespread effort to quash dissent in the country, which has seen dozens of activists put on trial after a failed 2016 coup attempt."
"England Drops Its Quarantine for Most Visitors, but Not Those From the U.S.",2020-07-03,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — England will drop its mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from more than 50 countries but leave the restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States, deepening the isolation of America and delivering another rebuke to President Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The European Union recently upheld a ban on travelers from the United States, even as it opened its borders to visitors from Canada, Rwanda, Thailand and 15 other countries. England’s policy, announced on Friday, is not as draconian. Visitors from America can still enter the country so long as they agree to isolate themselves for two weeks. But those from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and dozens of other countries will be able to travel to England with no restrictions — an arrangement intended to bolster the languishing tourism industry in time for the summer vacation season. The regulations will take effect on July 10. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland apply their own travel policies and may not follow England’s lead in easing restrictions. The United States has barred most visitors from Britain since March, after briefly exempting them from a travel ban on the European Union. At the time, Europe was dealing with far more coronavirus infections than the United States. Since then, the epicenter of the pandemic has moved across the Atlantic. During the initial phase of the outbreak, Britain stayed open to travel from viral hot spots like Italy, Spain and Iran. By the time it imposed the quarantine measures, its infection rates were among the highest in the world. That prompted fierce criticism of a policy that placed restrictions on people arriving from countries where the virus was well under control, including New Zealand. The authorities threatened to fine rule breakers up to £1,000 ($1,245). Critics said the measures were economically damaging, ineffective and legally unenforceable because the country did not have the resources to ensure that people were obeying their 14-day quarantine. Of the 12 police forces that replied to questions from the BBC, none said they had handed out any fines. Some public-health experts said the fractious debate over the quarantine had distracted from more pressing problems, like safely reopening Britain’s schools, organizing an effective test-and-trace program and organizing a system to stamp out new outbreaks in cities like Leicester to avert a second lockdown. “The U.K. government seems focused on giving people a summer pandemic holiday instead of dealing with the hard issues facing the aviation industry for the coming year,” said Professor Devi Sridhar, the director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. Scotland has balked at the easing, much as it resisted Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s earlier plans to lift the lockdown. Its infection and death rates are lower than in England, which officials attribute to its more cautious approach. The Scottish government has yet to decide how to relax restrictions on travelers, though its options are somewhat limited, given its open border with England. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the BBC on Friday that the United States would be excluded from the immediate relaxation because of the “very high numbers of infections” in the country. The government has designated countries with green, yellow and red lights, based on “the prevalence of coronavirus, the numbers of new cases and potential trajectory of the disease in that destination.” The United States has a red light. The announcement appeared to go further than an earlier idea floated by ministers to create “air bridges” with specific countries, in which travelers would have reciprocal freedom to travel. The government still hopes that a number of the exempted countries will not require visitors from Britain to quarantine. But the list of greenlight countries comprises more than 50\xa0— among them Vietnam and Hong Kong, though not mainland China. Some could still require travelers from Britain to quarantine on arrival. On the British end, many arriving passengers will still be required to provide contact information. Still, for the travel industry, it was a welcome relief after a tense period when they worried that the summer season was going to be ruined. Many complained about the damage to their businesses and warned about job losses. “It has been an incredibly frustrating time,” said Steven Freudmann, the chairman of the Institute of Travel and Tourism, a lobbying group. “There just appears to be no coordinated thinking. A shambles is the only word I can think of.” Mr. Freudmann said he was “happy and relieved that finally — finally — the government seems to be making sensible decisions.” But he said the government’s erratic policies had “created a lack of confidence and clearly we, as an industry, have a job in establishing that confidence.” Nor was Mr. Freudmann the only critic of the government’s decision-making over quarantine rules. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, described it as “shambolic,” adding that she wanted to study the detail before taking any decision on whether Scotland should adopt the new program with England. Among those who flouted the existing travel restrictions was the father of Mr. Johnson, Stanley Johnson. The elder Mr. Johnson, 79, posted pictures on social media of his arrival in Greece, which currently prevents vacationers from flying directly from Britain. He apparently got there via the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. It was not the first time he had defied government coronavirus advice. Before Britain’s lockdown began, when the prime minister urged Britons not to go to the pub, his father said he would go anyway if he felt the thirst. Speaking from Greece, Stanley Johnson told the Daily Mail newspaper that he was in the country on “essential business, trying to Covid-proof my property in view of the upcoming letting season.”']","In a bid to salvage the summer tourist season, travelers from France, Italy, Spain and dozens of other nations no longer have to isolate for 14 days after arriving."
Attacks in Somalia Leave at Least 5 Dead,2020-07-04,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Attacks in two of Somalia’s largest cities killed five people and wounded 16 others Saturday, in the latest example of the chronic failure of the country’s security sector to crack down on terrorist groups. In the capital, Mogadishu, a suicide car bomber targeted a tax collection center in the Hamar Jajab district in the city’s southeast, the Somali Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism said in a statement. While security officers were able to stop the attacker from reaching the collection center, the blast damaged a nearby wall and wounded six people, including police officers. The bomber died in the attack. In Baidoa, the capital of the southwestern Bay region, a land mine detonated near a restaurant on the outskirts of the city, killing five people and wounding 10 others, government officials said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the Shabab, which is linked to Al Qaeda, has carried out similar assaults in the past. “The Somali government condemns in the strongest terms the attacks against the civilians,” the statement from the ministry read. The attacks come 11 days after the Shabab claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing on a Turkish military base in Somalia. Known as Camp Turksom, the compound, Turkey’s biggest overseas military base, is used to train Somali forces and is part of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s efforts to strengthen his country’s strategic presence in the Horn of Africa. In recent years, the Shabab, which controls large swaths of south and central Somalia, has continued to gain strength, carrying out deadly attacks in both Somalia and Kenya. In late December, the group killed 82 people, including 16 university students, when it detonated an explosives-laden truck at a busy intersection in Mogadishu. A week later, the Shabab killed a U.S. service member and two American military contractors when insurgents from the group overran a base in Kenya that houses American troops. The devastating and almost daily attacks against civilians, public officials and security offices have put a strain on the fragile Somali government. Despite a flurry of American drone strikes and a 20,000-strong African Union peacekeeping mission fighting the Shabab, the internationally backed Somali government has remained weak and has appeared unable to secure the capital, much less the entire country. Somali officials, however, dispute that, saying they are increasingly thwarting attacks from the Shabab. They cited the ability of security forces to prevent the attacker from entering the collection center in Saturday’s Mogadishu bombing as evidence of progress. Hussein Mohamed contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.']","Devastating assaults, occurring almost daily and often in the capital, Mogadishu, have put a strain on the country’s fragile government."
"Caribbean, Struggling in the Pandemic, Braces for Hurricane Season",2020-07-04,By Kirk Semple,"['MEXICO CITY — Houses with no roofs. Neighborhoods lacking electricity. Residents who fled still in exile. Ten months after Hurricane Dorian pulverized the northern Bahamas, those islands are still struggling to recover, even as this year’s hurricane season begins. But rebuilding, always a slow process, has been slowed even further this year by a disaster of another sort: the coronavirus pandemic. “That brought rebuilding efforts to a complete halt,” said Stafford Symonette, an evangelical pastor whose house on Great Abaco Island was severely damaged during the hurricane — and remains that way. “You still have a lot of people in tents and temporary shelters,” he said. The Bahamas — like other hurricane-prone countries in the Caribbean and North Atlantic — find themselves at the dramatic convergence of a devastating pandemic and an Atlantic hurricane season that is expected to be more active than normal. The pandemic has profoundly affected all aspects of hurricane preparedness and response, and left nations even more vulnerable to the impacts of storms. It has complicated rebuilding efforts from past hurricane seasons. It has crippled national economies in the region, many of which depend heavily on tourism. It has forced the reallocation of diminished government resources — money and personnel that otherwise might have been used for hurricane-related work — to deal with the public health crisis. And it has meant that, in the event of a major storm, evacuation centers and shelters could now turn into dangerous vectors of coronavirus contagion, driving governments and relief agencies to figure out new protocols to keep evacuees safe. These mounting challenges have overwhelmed many of the region’s governments and relief agencies, which are scrambling to prepare for the next big storm. “Are we prepared for this hurricane season?” said Ronald Sanders, ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the United States and to the Organization of American States. “The answer is: no. And I don’t care who tells you we are. We haven’t been able to dedicate any funds toward hurricane preparedness this year.” “These countries are struggling and have been for some time,” he continued. “The reality is that we are in dire straits.” Weather scientists from the American government have predicted that during this Atlantic storm season, which began on June 1 and runs through Nov. 30, there will be as many as 19 named storms, with as many as six growing to major hurricane status. An average hurricane season has 12 named storms and three major hurricanes. The season has gotten off to a quick start, with four named storms so far. The region started the season at a severe economic disadvantage. The pandemic crushed the tourism industry, a main economic engine for much of the Caribbean. Hotels were shuttered, cruise ships remained docked, airplanes were grounded. The Caribbean Development Bank estimated that regional economic activity may contract by as much as 20 percent this year. Mr. Sanders said he worried about what would happen should the region suffer a repeat of 2017, when several major hurricanes plowed through the Caribbean. “If that were to happen again this year,” he said, “well, I think these economies will go into complete collapse.” The pandemic has also presented a range of public health challenges for governments and relief groups preparing for hurricanes, including the need to ensure adequate social distancing during evacuations and in shelters, and a sufficient supply of personal protective gear for emergency workers and evacuees. Health officials are also trying to stockpile medicine and other supplies and prepare for possible coronavirus outbreaks among evacuees. “Without a doubt, once we have a natural hazard such as a hurricane, there will be a greater rate of infection, particularly with respect to Covid-19, among other diseases that could arise,” Dr. Laura-Lee Boodram, an official with the Caribbean Public Health Agency, warned during a recent panel discussion organized by the Caribbean Tourism Organization. The Bahamas has been at a particular disadvantage in its efforts to get out ahead of this year’s hurricane threat. The coronavirus pandemic swept into the region only a few months after Dorian, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, made landfall on Sept. 1, 2019, killing scores of people in the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama Island, destroying thousands of structures and causing billions of dollars in damage. Recovery efforts were fully underway by the time the country recorded its first coronavirus case on March 16. But less than two weeks later, with the number of infections mounting, the government had closed the nation’s borders and had begun imposing a series of restrictions on movement, including curfews, 24-hour lockdowns and a ban on travel between the archipelago’s islands. While the measures helped curb the spread of the virus — the Bahamas has only 104 confirmed cases so far — they slowed recovery, delayed preparations for the new hurricane season and, combined with the global halt of the tourism industry, further plunged the country into economic distress. The Bahamian government said it expects to incur a $1.3 billion deficit this fiscal year, equivalent to about 11.6 percent of gross domestic product and the largest in the history of the Bahamas. “Any significant storm damage this year would put us in a very serious spot in terms of our fiscal projections,” Peter Turnquest, the Bahamas’ deputy prime minister and finance minister, said in an interview this week. Among emergency officials’ greatest concerns as the hurricane season unfolds is the insufficient number of storm shelters in parts of the Bahamas. Many that were damaged during Dorian have yet to be repaired. The International Organization for Migration said in a report in May that only 13 of the 25 official shelters on the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama were “usable” and had only enough capacity for about 2 percent of the population. “We certainly pray that there are no storms this year,” Mr. Turnquest said. Adding to the uncertainty, the government is now poised to reopen the country’s borders to international visitors. The decision has sowed anxiety among many Bahamians who fear that it might spur a second wave of infections across the islands, triggering more lockdowns and border closures, and further complicating hurricane preparedness and response. “People are nervous,” said Steve Pedican, whose house on Great Abaco Island was severely damaged in the hurricane. “People don’t know what to expect now.” When asked what might happen should a major hurricane make landfall on Great Abaco in the coming months, Mr. Symonette, the evangelical pastor, went silent for a while, mulling the implications. “I don’t know how we would cope with it if we get another one this year,” he finally said. “Praise God, that he be merciful to us.” Rachel Knowles contributed reporting from Nassau, Bahamas.']","Scientists predict this hurricane season will be severe. But countries in the region, with economies burdened by the pandemic and the devastation of past hurricanes, have not been able to fully prepare."
‘I Thought I Would Die’: Inside Myanmar’s Risky Pursuit of Jade,2020-07-03,By Saw Nang and Richard C. Paddock,"['MANDALAY, Myanmar — An ominous rumbling was the only warning the young jade miner had that something was wrong. Within seconds he was running, but before he could take even a few steps he was swept away by a huge wave of mud and water. Tumbling underwater, he managed to reach the surface, swimming for half an hour before finding land. “I thought I would die,” said the miner, Ko Aung Kyaw Htay, 23, on Friday, a day after the disaster at Wai Khar mine in northern Myanmar left an estimated 200 people dead. “I still can’t believe I escaped. I have no idea what happened to the other people working around me. I guess they all died.” Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay was one of hundreds of unauthorized jade pickers scavenging on the edges of the Wai Khar open-pit mine in Kachin State, the lucrative center of Myanmar’s jade trade where rebels and government forces are facing off, when disaster struck. Heavy rains from the annual monsoon had filled the giant mine with water, creating a lake. Just after sunrise on Thursday, a wall of the mine collapsed, crashing into the lake and generating a wave more than 20 feet high. He survived with only scratches. But he saw no sign of 50 other miners who were working nearby when the wave hit. By Friday afternoon, searchers had recovered 172 bodies floating on the lake or washed ashore at the mine in Hpakant township. An additional 54 were injured. Similar disasters are an almost annual occurrence in the jade fields of Myanmar, which produce about 70 percent of the world’s jade and generate billions of dollars a year. Most of the jade mined there is exported across the border into China. The jade industry, largely controlled by the military and its crony companies, operates in near secrecy. The military is in constant conflict with rebel groups in the region, including the Kachin Independence Army, which is seeking self-rule and is said to extract its own revenues from mining operations. Jade pickers say the rebel group assesses fees for letting them operate on the fringes of the government-authorized mining operations. About 300,000 miners come from all over the country to hunt for jade — about two-thirds of them working illegally — even though it is extremely hazardous. Small landslides, which go unnoticed in the outside world, kill 100 or more miners a year. Major mine collapses, like the Wai Khar disaster, occur nearly annually. “Actually people are dying from accidents almost every day here,” said U Tin Soe, who represents the region in Parliament. “We just don’t have a record of it.” The Wai Khar mine, which is operated legally by a consortium of five companies, had officially shut down Tuesday for the rainy season because of the danger of landslides. It will reopen in October. But the jade pickers — who often work for local bosses and must pay a share of their earnings to rebel groups that operate in the area — immediately moved into the mine this week despite the risk. Mr. Tin said the nature of the region and the miners’ desperation make it difficult to prevent frequent disasters. “There is no rule of law in this area,” he said. “All the miners have to take responsibility for the continuous landslides in Hpakant. It happens because of their greed. Nobody can stop it.” Daw Moe Thandar and her younger brother, Ko Moe Myint, came to Hpakant two years ago from the city of Thandwe in Rakhine state to work as unauthorized jade pickers. Mr. Moe Myint, 20, began work early on Thursday at the Wai Khar mine. His sister, 28, learned of the landslide around 8 a.m. and raced there. She found her brother lying on the ground in a row of dead bodies. “That moment was like the end of my world to see my little brother lying there,” she said. “I feel like someone took my life too.” She said she worried her aging parents would be overcome by grief at hearing the news. “We just wanted to have enough money to survive,” she said, crying. “But our lives are gone.” Myanmar, also known as Burma, was controlled for decades by the military, which still maintains vast authority and operates autonomously under the 2008 Constitution that it enacted. The military owns two large conglomerates, which have extensive operations in a wide range of businesses, including jade. A study by the anti-corruption group Global Witness found that Myanmar’s jade business was worth as much as $31 billion in 2014, almost half the country’s gross domestic product. “The government has turned a blind eye to continued illicit and rapacious mining practices in Hpakant despite vowing to reform the hazardous sector,” said Paul Donowitz, campaign leader at Global Witness. “This was an entirely preventable tragedy that should serve as an urgent wake-up call for the government.” Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay, the survivor of the Wai Khar disaster, moved to the region three years ago from the city of Magway in central Myanmar. Until a few months ago, he worked independently as a jade picker and said he had to pay a share of his earnings directly to the Kachin Independence Army. His biggest find was a piece of jade he sold for $2,200. He said he paid nearly $600 of it to the rebels. “People from the KIA are everywhere and they can smell who is selling the jade and who has the good quality jade,” he said, referring to the rebel group. “If you don’t pay you will be shot and die anonymously.” Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay said he recently decided to work for a local mining boss because he could no longer make it on his own after the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Myanmar has been largely unaffected by the virus, at least according to official data, with only 304 reported cases and six deaths in a population of 54 million. But the pandemic has largely shut down the global market for jade, especially in China, and Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay said he could not survive without buyers. The boss, who operates outside the law like his pickers, typically pays for food and a place to stay and keeps half of whatever they find. Despite Mr. Aung Kyaw Htay’s narrow escape, and the scratches on his arms, legs and face, he has no intention of quitting. “There is no other job for me,” he said. “It’s better to die than to live with nothing to eat. I know this work is very dangerous, but living in hunger is just as dangerous.” And unlike on other jobs, if his luck holds in the jade mines, he hopes one day that he will strike it rich. “If I find a good quality, high-price piece of jade,” he said, “my dream is to buy a house in my hometown and marry a beautiful girl.” Saw Nang reported from Mandalay, Myanmar, and Richard C. Paddock from Bangkok.']","A survivor was swept away by a wave of mud and water after the wall of a mine collapsed on Thursday, killing at least 200 people."
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Won’t Cross the Border for Washington Summit,2020-07-06,By Catherine Porter,"['TORONTO — He sent his regrets. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed on Monday he won’t attend a meeting in Washington this week with President Donald Trump and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico. The meeting was meant to celebrate the official start of the new trade deal between the three countries — the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (U.S.M.C.A.). Mr. Trudeau’s reason for not attending? Scheduling conflicts, he said. He has virtual cabinet meetings and a “long-planned” session in Parliament on Wednesday, when the Washington summit is scheduled to begin. That Mr. Trudeau would choose not to fly to Washington to celebrate what many consider one of his most important accomplishments to date — securing the pact with his country’s biggest, and in recent times, most temperamental, trading partner — was striking. He and his team spent more than a year feverishly working on closing the deal, often dropping everything to rush to Washington. But the pressure evaporated in November 2018, when it was officially signed. And since the coronavirus pandemic reached Canada, the prime minister has become the country’s model for following new medical guidelines on virus-spreading prevention, which include wearing a mask and avoiding travel. “Will Trump be wearing a mask in the meeting?” asked Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, and a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trudeau. Would Mr. Trump stand closer than two meters away? “I don’t think Trudeau has any interest in being drawn into American debates on mask-wearing and appropriate health precautions during an epidemic,” Mr. Paris said. While President Trump has continually underplayed the severity of the virus, and even mocked people for wearing masks, Mr. Trudeau became the first G7 leader to self-isolate after his wife came down with flulike symptoms and later tested positive for Covid-19 in March. For two weeks, Mr. Trudeau juggled the country’s response to the pandemic from his home study, caring for the couple’s three young children without the help of his usual political aides or personal staff. He didn’t get a test himself because, at that time, doctors were advising only those with symptoms to get tested, and he had none. It would also look hypocritical for the prime minister to dash into the United States for a quick trip when his government officially shut the border in March to anything but essential travel, experts said. “It’s not clear that a photo op counts as essential,” said Mr. Paris. Polls have consistently shown the majority of Canadians want the U.S.-Canada border to remain closed for safety reasons. While new cases of the novel coronavirus surge to record levels in many parts of the United States, they have dropped across Canada to levels similar to March. To date, around 8,700 Canadians have died from the disease. “It would be really awkward for the prime minister to go when, in all likelihood, the border is not going to open, given the escalating cases in the United States,” said Janice Stein, the founding director of the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. Not everyone agreed. “It’s a rookie mistake for him not to go,” said John Higginbotham, a senior fellow at Carleton University in Ottawa who served as the second-highest-ranking Canadian diplomat in Washington for six years. “That’s the president to have in front of us. There are so many issues to be discussed. There’s so much turbulence internationally, then there’s long-term trade, and economic cooperation between our countries and the opening of the border.” And Mr. Trump “may take this as a slight,” Mr. Higginbotham added. Mr. Trudeau has been at the receiving end of Mr. Trump’s quick-twitch anger before. The president was so furious with Mr. Trudeau when he said Canadians would not be pushed around at the end of the G7 summit in Canada in 2018 that he lashed out on Twitter, calling his host “very dishonest and weak” as he departed the country. In recent weeks, the Trump administration discussed reimposing tariffs on Canadian aluminum over concerns about rising exports to the United States.  Mr. Trudeau did promise Mr. Obrador a visit “as soon as possible” over the phone. When that would be, his staff would not say.']","Mr. Trudeau was invited to the meeting this week to celebrate the official start of a new trade deal. But as Canada’s coronavirus preventer-in-chief, he hardly could go, experts said."
"Russia Arrests Space Agency Official, Accusing Him of Treason",2020-07-07,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Russia’s secret police on Tuesday arrested a respected former reporter who worked in recent months as an adviser to the head of the country’s space agency, accusing him of treason for passing secrets to a NATO country. Life News, a tabloid news site with close ties to the security apparatus, posted a video of the former reporter, Ivan I. Safronov, being bundled off a leafy Moscow street into a gray van by plainclothes officers of the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the domestic arm of what was known in Soviet times as the K.G.B. The F.S.B. said that Mr. Safronov was suspected of working for the intelligence service of an unspecified NATO country, passing on “classified information about military-technical cooperation, defense and the security of the Russian Federation.” What information that could be, however, was unclear. Mr. Safronov only started working at the space agency, Roscosmos, in May. Before that, he worked for more than a decade as a well-regarded journalist for Kommersant and then Vedomosti, both privately owned business newspapers with no obvious access to state secrets. Outraged at what was widely viewed as another example of overreach by Russia’s sprawling and often paranoid security apparatus, journalists and ordinary Muscovites gathered in small groups outside the headquarters of the F.S.B. to protest the arrest. Several were detained for holding up signs in support of Mr. Safronov. Andrei A. Soldatov, an investigative reporter who has written extensively about Russia’s security services, said Mr. Safronov’s arrest on suspicion of treason marked “an absolutely new level of repression against journalism.” While journalists have often been accused of crimes, he said, accusations of treason had been “inconceivable.” Even journalists known for their zealous loyalty to the authorities expressed unease. Margarita Simonyan, the chief editor of Kremlin-funded television network RT, tweeted that “it would be good to get an explanation of what exactly Safronov is accused of — journalist work for foreigners or direct work for foreign special services. There is a huge difference.” With hundreds of journalists working abroad for RT, Ms. Simonyan clearly worries that Mr. Safronov’s troubles could be used by foreign governments as an excuse to justify detaining her own employees, who have often been accused of peddling propaganda for the Kremlin. Russian journalists who take on the authorities are frequently harassed, detained, framed and even killed. In a rare reversal, the government in June last year dropped a case against Ivan Golunov, an investigative reporter arrested on bogus narcotics charges. The evidence against him was widely believed to have been manufactured by the police on orders from the F.S.B. to punish Mr. Golunov for reporting work that upset the financial interests of security officers. The authorities ultimately acknowledged that the evidence had been fabricated. On Monday, a court in western Russia convicted another journalist, Svetlana Prokopyeva, of terrorism-related charges that even the Kremlin’s own human rights council had described as unwarranted. In a statement on Tuesday, the newspaper where Mr. Safronov had worked, Kommersant, described its former journalist as a “true patriot of Russia” and scorned claims of treason as “absurd.” It said that Mr. Safronov had joined the newspaper to take a job covering defense issues that was previously held by his father, also named Ivan, who died in March 2007 after falling from the fifth floor of a Moscow apartment building. Prosecutors at the time described the fall as a suicide, but colleagues scorned this explanation and suspected possible foul play. The older Mr. Safronov died after publishing a series of scoops that had infuriated the Russian military. Roscosmos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr. Safronov had been arrested on suspicion of treason but said that the detention did not relate to his work at the agency. At the same time, the Kremlin said that the arrest had nothing to do with his previous work as a journalist, which included coverage of President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said he did not know how Mr. Safronov could have obtained classified information whose disclosure would qualify as treason, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Trials involving state secrets are generally closed to the public, making it impossible for anyone outside the system to know whether there is any real evidence. A former American marine, Paul N. Whelan, received a 16-year jail sentence for espionage last month after a closed trial that the U.S. ambassador to Russia, John J. Sullivan, denounced as a “mockery of justice.” The arrest on Tuesday of Mr. Safronov prompted dismay and anger among journalists, including those who have mostly avoided open confrontation with the authorities. Elena Chernenko, a foreign affairs journalist at Kommersant, Mr. Safronov’s former newspaper, staged a one-person picket, the only form of protest permitted without prior approval, outside the headquarters of the F.S.B., holding up a sign demanding “information and justice in connection with Ivan Safronov.” Police officers took her away. Even Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, seemed surprised by the arrest of a journalist who had once worked in the Kremlin pool and whom he had previously described as highly talented. “Ivan will have a chance to defend himself,” Mr. Peskov told journalists on Tuesday. Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow. ']","The detention of Ivan Safronov, a former journalist who had been working as an adviser at Roscosmos, took many by surprise.

‘He’s Buying Up Brixton’: Beloved Grocer’s Eviction Sparks Gentrification Fight,2020-07-06,By Adam Satariano,"['LONDON — Saja Shaheen is walking the aisles of Nour Cash & Carry, explaining the eclectic inventory of the popular grocery store her family has owned inside Brixton Market for more than 20 years. As new immigrant communities arrive in the diverse area of south London, she said, foods are added to match their tastes. Bags of rice are piled six feet high near the entrance, next to 15-liter jugs of various cooking oils. Spiced plantain chips and eight varieties of jerk sauce are imported from the Caribbean. There are bags of egusi, ground prawns and dried crayfish used for African dishes. Date syrups, tahini and okra cater to Middle Eastern customers. Nour has the crammed charm of a classic New York bodega, but with a standout food selection that has made it popular with local restaurant chefs. (“It’s Whole Foods without the eye-watering prices, for real people,” said a local blog.) The store is not designed for comfort — or social distancing. Elbowing someone aside to reach a bag of beans or cornmeal is acceptable. There are no discernible checkout lines. The staff is savvy at defusing arguments. “Some people say they come here for the fight,” said Ms. Shaheen, walking through a spice aisle that stretches toward the ceiling, filled with curry powders, cardamom, nutmeg, paprika and peppercorns (green, red, black, white and pink). “It’s an authentic shop. It doesn’t look fancy. It’s been built organically.” Nour’s beloved status in Brixton, a vibrant, occasionally chaotic, multicultural hub, made it a shock in January when the Shaheen family received an eviction notice. New landlords, Hondo Enterprises, run by a 39-year-old multimillionaire from Texas who moonlights as a house-music D.J., said the tenants needed to move out by July 22. A new power substation was being built on the premises to provide electricity for other shops in the increasingly upmarket shopping area where Nour is. When the Shaheen family refused to strike a deal, a gentrification fight began. A group of customers organized to save the store, saying Nour’s fate was a referendum about broader changes in Brixton. And like many such battles — whether in San Francisco, New York or Paris — those being displaced in Brixton are disproportionately lower income and from minority communities, raising issues of race in a country that has long struggled to address the topic head on. “The shop became emblematic of something more,” said Hiba Ahmad, who helped organize the campaign, called Save Nour. “Everyone has seen this story over and over.” The Shaheen family is originally from Iraq but was forced out in 1980 by Saddam Hussein’s regime. The family stayed in Iran for a decade before eventually going to London in 1990. “We thought Europe was heaven,” said Salam Shaheen, Saja’s father, who drives every evening to a London wholesale market to hand-select produce for the store. The family settled near Brixton, an area with a reputation for welcoming immigrant families. Starting in the 1940s, Brixton was the center of the Windrush Generation, the people who moved from Jamaica and other colonies to help rebuild the country after World War II. Many welcomed development of Brixton when investors began putting money into the area. The community had long been neglected and developed a rough reputation, particularly after riots in 1981 that were in part a result of racial tensions and aggressive police tactics. Two glass-covered pedestrian arcades in the center of Brixton, dating from the 1920s and 1930s, became run down and were nearly turned into apartments in 2008. Now a registered heritage site, Brixton Market, including the arcades, is a shopping and nightlife destination, with independent shops, restaurants and bars opening next to older merchants like Nour, fishmongers and butchers.  But locals have watched warily as the change accelerated, fueled by Brixton’s once relatively affordable cost of living, public transportation links, boisterous nightlife, and enviable music, art and food scenes. A mural of David Bowie, who was born in Brixton, is a popular Instagram stop for tourists. “All the local people, ethnic minorities, are being driven away,” said Folashade Akande, owner of Iya-Ibadan, a store that has sold African food and crafts in the market for more than 20 years. As new shops like the “plant-based cheesemonger” opened nearby, her rents have increased. “I’ll try to stay as long as I can,” she said. In the Nour campaign, anti-gentrification activists found a seemingly perfect foil in Taylor McWilliams, Hondo’s chief executive. With financial backing from the American hedge fund Angelo Gordon, Mr. McWilliams bought the covered markets in 2018 for more than 37 million pounds, about $46 million today, along with a popular nightclub and another property he plans to convert into a 20-story office building, which would be Brixton’s tallest. “He’s buying up Brixton,” said Anees Matooq, a Nour customer who is active in the Save Nour group. Mr. Matooq said a prevailing view was that Mr. McWilliams, who dated an ex-girlfriend of Prince Harry and is a regular on the Ibiza club scene as a D.J. in the house-music group Housekeeping, wanted to make Brixton into an area where he and his friends want to hang out on weekends. For many, he represents what Brixton is not. Mr. McWilliams said he wasn’t interested in changing Brixton. He wondered why he was cast as the villain, given that he had already spent more than £2 million, or $2.5 million, to fix plumbing problems, refurbish bathrooms and install a heating system that will keep the market busy during winter. He suspended rents for all tenants for three months after the pandemic broke out. In April, while at home obeying Britain’s lockdown orders, the Save Nour campaigners infiltrated an online charity concert Mr. McWilliams was playing. The activists dressed up as clubgoers until Mr. McWilliams’s set began, when they revealed themselves and began heckling and criticizing him with signs in front of more than a thousand internet onlookers. Suddenly club music websites were writing about the effort to save Nour. Many in Brixton said the campaigners had a false sense of nostalgia. Ian Riley, a Scotsman who owns a plant and homewares store, Cornercopia, remembers finding dead rats and human feces when he took over a unit in the market more than a decade ago. Marsha Smith, a local D.J. who grew up going to Nour with her mother, said that while she was frustrated that new shops were tailored more to well-heeled customers, Brixton had gone through different waves of change. “You’ve got the original yuppies who don’t like the new yuppies,” she said. In June, facing a drop in sales as a result of the pandemic, the Shaheen family was preparing a court challenge to save Nour. Local celebrities like the chef Yotam Ottolenghi spoke out on the store’s behalf, and more than 55,000 people signed an online petition. But on June 19, after a flurry of negotiations, a deal was reached. Nour would move to a new location in the market with a slightly lower rent. “It feels like a big, giant hug,” Ms. Shaheen said at the store the next morning, as customers stopped in to congratulate the family. “It validated us, an immigrant family coming here to this country and not being British.” A few days later, sitting on a park bench a short walk from Nour, Mr. McWilliams said the intention had never been for Nour to close, but to move so that he could make improvements. The Nour space was the only suitable location for long-overdue power upgrades. The online protests, he said, had taken a personal toll. Activists targeted his friends, bandmates and girlfriend. People whom he had not spoken to in 10 years received angry messages. His manager “effectively dropped” his band after other artists complained about his work in Brixton. “It’s all part of this crazy cancel culture,” he said. “It’s astonishing to me.” Emboldened by the Nour campaign, anti-gentrification activists are turning their sights to other projects in the area, and pressuring local political figures to slow development. “This is the beginning of a long-term campaign,” said Danai Nardi, a film producer who has lived in Brixton for more than 23 years. Ms. Shaheen said she was ready to move on. She is embracing Brixton’s shifting identity, including tailoring Nour’s inventory to Brixton’s latest arrivals. She pointed to oat and almond milks now on sale, along with fancy rock salts and organic peanut butter. “You always need a balance,” she said with a laugh.']","In south London, people rebelled when a developer, backed by an American hedge fund, tried to evict Nour Cash & Carry."
Travel Restrictions on Americans Erode a Sense of Passport Privilege,2020-07-07,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — Five American travelers who set out for a getaway on Sardinia were turned away last week after their private jet landed on the Mediterranean island. In Canada, two Americans were fined for flouting tougher entry restrictions imposed by their northern neighbor. And in Mexico, governors are pleading with the central government to introduce tighter restrictions on travelers from the United States to help prevent the spread of the virus. While coronavirus travel restrictions may vary from country to country, much of the world is united in one aspect of their current response: Travelers from the United States are not welcome. A U.S. passport, long seen as a golden ticket to visa-free travel in much of the world, has long provided its holders with the ability to trot around the globe with ease. Now, that sense of passport privilege Americans are used to is fading. “This is shocking, to see one of the most advanced countries in the world be put in the slow lane of the global reopening,” said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the London research institution for international affairs. Mr. Niblett said the fading power of the American passport was not surprising “given that America’s health care system is decentralized, unpredictable and unequal” and given how the virus continues to spread unabated in large portions of the country. In a world where pandemic travel restrictions are excluding people from countries with uncontrolled coronavirus outbreaks, and where the United States continues to set daily records of new cases, the long-lauded American passport, once a symbol of power and exceptionalism, is becoming stigmatized. Last week, when the European Union formalized a plan to restart travel from certain countries, visitors from the United States were notably left off the list, a stinging blow to American prestige. American citizens who live in countries on the approved list will be allowed to enter the European Union. Travelers from the United States, like those blocked from the Italian island of Sardinia last week, are finding themselves unwanted. The five Americans who had flown to Sardinia had come from Colorado, traveling with several people from other nations in a private jet to the Italian island. After five in the group were barred entry, everyone eventually left. Dimitry Kochenov, a co-creator of The Quality of Nationality Index, which explores the benefits accorded to citizens of different countries, said the pandemic restrictions put into stark relief the restrictions that people of certain nationalities faced at international borders. “Citizenship is the main factor behind preserving global inequalities today,” he said. “So of course the U.S. passport has always symbolized the ultimate level of this privilege.” Mr. Kochenov, a professor of European constitutional law at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, said the Sardinia incident showed that even the large sums of money needed to fly a personal plane to Europe could not “allow them to overcome the deficiency of the U.S. passport today.” While a U.S. passport typically allows for visa-free movement in much of the world, Mr. Kochenov noted that European Union passports outrank it in quality because they grant holders the freedom to resettle anywhere in the European Union with full rights. Until the recent restrictions, the U.S. passport had long provided its holders with an outsize sense of freedom that was the envy of others. The restrictions that Americans now face are “something that much of the rest of the world knows very well,” Mr. Kochenov said. Some Americans say they have been surprised by the shift in perception toward American travelers during the pandemic, expressing concerns that it could be damaging, at least symbolically. Vincent Rajkumar, a professor of medicine in Minnesota who became a U.S. citizen 15 years ago, said he has always been in awe of how the country’s passport had opened doors that were once shut to him. During a trip to Australia in January, he was alarmed that passengers were being questioned extensively about whether they had been to China. “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, I’m so glad I have a U.S. passport, this is never going to happen to me,’” he said. “And then in the past two months, this is dawning on me — ‘This is going to happen to us. This is happening to us.’” ShaDonna Jackson, a photographer from Maryland who has been vocal on social media about seeking dual citizenship, said she was spurred to act in part by the new restrictions on U.S. travelers. “The perception of the U.S. right now in terms of how safe people are with the coronavirus spreading — I see how it can be scary to other countries,” she said. Mr. Niblett of Chatham House noted the turn of events was unsurprising after the United States issued a broad travel ban for European visitors in March, which gave implicit permission for other governments to do the same against Americans. President Trump’s abrupt decision, which was made without consultation with European leaders and without any warning, established the climate for the current travel restrictions on the United States. “When it’s done in that incredibly indiscriminate way, then it’s not surprising you get this counterreaction from American allies,” Mr. Niblett said, adding that Mr. Trump had “set the stage very much for this. And to be honest, it’s tragic.” The travel restrictions reflect the eroding relationship between Europe and the United States. Since Mr. Trump became president, the trans-Atlantic relationship is “becoming more shallow” despite the decades of cooperation after World War II, Mr. Niblett said. Diplomacy has “become more transactional” and focused on the short term. “And Europe now feels they have a right to be equally transactional in return,” Mr. Niblett said. But the sentiment is not coming only from Europe. American travelers to Canada who have attempted to skirt border restrictions that ban all but essential journeys have found themselves equally unwelcome. They face fines or being detained for failing to comply. Nova Scotia’s leader expressed frustration about travelers from America trying to circumvent restrictions by coming into the Canadian province. At the Mexican border, there has also been a stark reversal. Typically on the receiving end of border restrictions, Mexico, alarmed by the spiking infection rate in the United States, has moved to stem the flow of Americans into the country. Mexican states set up “sanitary filters”along the border during the July 4 weekend to check visitors’ temperatures and turn away anyone whose trip was not deemed essential. Officials in Mexican border states  have pushed for more aggressive steps to reduce crossings. Mr. Kochenov pointed out that simply focusing on the erosion of freedoms for American travelers missed the bigger picture. Many countries have introduced internal travel restrictions that limit movement among regions, states or other local jurisdictions. And most of the current restrictions are expected to be temporary. Americans may not like having their travels limited for now, but it is likely to be for the short term. Others will continue to face a tougher reality. “The majority of the population of the world will never be able to fly to Europe no matter what,” Mr. Kochenov said, because of visa restrictions or lack of money. “The pandemic simply demonstrates to Americans what the rest of the world has already known about the main function of nationality in the world.” Natalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from Mexico City.']","As countries across the world ease coronavirus restrictions but block American travelers, a long-held sense that the U.S. passport was a golden ticket is losing its luster."
"In Russia, They Tore Down Lots of Statues, but Little Changed",2020-07-07,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Elated by the defeat of a hard-line Communist coup in August 1991, thousands of mostly young Muscovites gathered in front of the K.G.B. headquarters and argued over how best to seal their victory with a bold, symbolic act. After some discussion, recalled Sergei B. Parkhomenko, then a young journalist covering the scene, the crowd turned its passion — more euphoria than anger, he said — on the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the ruthless founder of the Soviet secret police, which stood in a traffic circle in front of the Lubyanka, the forbidding stone building that housed the K.G.B. The removal of the statue, accomplished with help from a crane sent by Moscow city authorities, was greeted with cries of “Down with the K.G.B.” and sent a powerful message that change had finally come to Russia. Or so it seemed at the time. Nearly 30 years later, Russia is ruled by a former K.G.B. officer, President Vladimir V. Putin, and Dzerzhinsky is honored with a bust outside the Moscow city police headquarters. As the United States boils with anger over police brutality and racism, the experience of Russia since the collapse of Communism offers a cautionary lesson in the perils and disappointments of toppling monuments. Russia never engaged in a deep reckoning with its Soviet past, airing injustices and holding people accountable. Instead, atrocities were glossed over and some of the old elite, particularly in the security services, has reconstituted itself in power. Mr. Parkhomenko said he had no regrets about the removal of Dzerzhinsky — known as “Iron Felix” because of his unbending defense of Soviet Communism — and certainly doesn’t want him back. But he lamented that what had been a highly gratifying symbolic strike against the old order did not bury, or even really dent, the system the statue represented. “Everything has turned around,” he said. “The putsch failed, but 30 years later it has won. Russia’s power system today is much closer to what the putsch wanted to achieve than what those who protested against it wanted. This is our great tragedy.” The Dzerzhinsky statue was initially dumped on the ground outside a Moscow gallery of modern art along with other “fallen heroes” — among them a pink granite statue of Stalin, his face smashed by hammer blows, and a bronze statue of Yakov Sverdlov, an early Bolshevik leader, toppled in 1991 from a square facing the Bolshoi Theater. They are all now back on their feet as part of the Muzeon Park of Arts, a state-managed open-air exhibition that also includes artistic tributes to their victims, like a 1998 work called Victims of Totalitarian Regimes, a long wire cage containing sculpted stone heads. Every few years, the Communist Party calls for Dzerzhinsky’s return to his pedestal in front of what is now the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the post-Soviet name of an otherwise little-changed K.G.B. But the symbolism of that would be too much, even for Mr. Putin. The Kremlin has mostly focused on erecting new statues, not restoring those demolished in the 1990s. Among the new additions is a towering monument to Lt. Gen. Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, the designer of the AK-47 assault rifle. The bronze statue, erected in 2017 on one of Moscow’s busiest thoroughfares, depicts General Kalashnikov cradling one of his automatics, looking from a distance like an aging heavy metal guitarist. News broadcasts on Russian state television have been filled in recent days with scornful reports about statues coming under attack in the United States. They lament that Christopher Columbus, Confederate generals and other historical figures have been targeted by what is depicted as rage-filled vandalism. But Russia’s dismay is also felt by many liberal-minded intellectuals who do not watch state television or share its jingoistic glee at troubles in the West, but have lived through their own country’s efforts to shake off its past. “Waging war on bronze men doesn’t make your life any more moral or just,” said Maria Lipman, who worked in Moscow as a journalist as Communism was collapsing and cheered when Dzerzhinsky was taken down. “It does nothing really.” Statues of Stalin, the Soviet dictator who died in 1953, quickly vanished across the empire he ruled. One prominent exception was his hometown, Gori, in Georgia, which waited until 2010 to remove him from its central square. Today, however, the tyrant, whose body was removed in 1961 from a mausoleum in Red Square that still holds Lenin’s corpse, has never been more popular in Russia. An opinion poll last year found a record 70 percent thought Stalin played a positive role in Russian history. “Deleting doesn’t work,” said Nina Khrushcheva, a Russia expert at the New School in New York City whose grandfather, the former Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, tried to break the grip of Stalinism, only to be ousted from power in a 1964 Kremlin coup. “Denouncing Stalin was Khrushchev’s greatest achievement, but removing him from all public spaces, trying to delete that history, was a big mistake,” she said. “Once you demolish somebody’s hero you only incite hatred and force feelings underground.” Mikhail Y. Schneider, a pro-democracy activist who led protesters to the K.G.B. headquarters in August 1991, said attacking Dzerzhinsky’s statue was a “great emotional release” that “helped us believe we were living in a different country,” but “it changed nothing.” For real change, he said, the removal of Soviet-era symbols needed to be accompanied by a program of exposing crimes, putting those responsible on trial and returning confiscated property. “It is now too late,” he added. In a few lands liberated by the demise of Moscow’s empire, the swift removal of statues had a powerful impact. Three tiny Baltic nations quickly purged streets and parks of Soviet heroes as part of a broad and highly successful drive to rejoin the West and escape Moscow’s shadow. But Russia, where Soviet rule was a home-grown phenomenon, has struggled to confront an era that is still remembered with pride by many as a time of Russian grandeur. That seemingly immovable certainties enshrined in public monuments can and do change is a theme explored by a new art installation at Garage, a museum of contemporary art in Moscow. The installation, called Transformer and made up of interchangeable pieces that are regularly rearranged, was inspired by a square in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, that has had six different names and eight different monuments over the past century. Whether statues should stand or fall has been a topic of heated debate for decades in former Soviet lands. Ukraine, particularly, has demolished Lenin statues and other monuments with gusto, seeing them as symbols of past subjugation to Moscow. But this did nothing to make Ukraine any less corrupt or its officials any more accountable. Instead, it widened divisions between the Russian-speaking east of the country, which has clung to its statues of Lenin as totems of identity, and the rest of Ukraine. When protesters in Kyiv, the capital, toppled Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin president in February 2014, Russian-speaking agitators in the country’s east set up an armed camp around a statue of Lenin in the city of Donetsk, vowing to defend it from what they said would be imminent vandalism. Defense of Lenin against attacks that never came stoked emotion, rallied resistance to the new government in Kyiv and helped turn what began as a local quarrel over language and identity into a full-scale war. Fanned by Moscow, which sent fighters and weapons, the conflict, now it its sixth year, has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Aleksei P. Kondaurov, a retired K.G.B. officer who was working late in the Lubyanka when protesters gathered outside in August 1991 and began attacking Dzerzhinsky, worried that events could easily spin out of control. He said he told armed guards not to shoot if protesters tried to enter the mostly empty building. He was horrified when the crane arrived and pulled Dzerzhinsky from his pedestal, dumping him on the ground. “For me this was a big pyschological blow. It ended a stage of my life,” he recalled. But, he added, “I never thought this was a new start. I realized nothing would come from this.” Though now a critic of Mr. Putin and what he sees as Russia’s steady drift backwards, Mr. Kondaurov denounces the “vandalism” of Russia’s first democratically elected leader, President Boris N. Yeltsin, and his supporters. “Putin is the direct continuation of Yeltsin,” he said, lamenting that symbolic gestures have become a substitute for concrete, forward-looking change. “We are always looking backwards, and old ideas keep coming back,” he said. “But let statues stay in peace. They are witnesses to each epoch and its history. Talk about them and argue about them. But why tear them down?”']","“Waging war on bronze men doesn’t make your life any more moral or just,” one observer noted. “It does nothing really.”"
"Hong Kong, Changed Overnight, Navigates Its New Reality",2020-07-05,"By Vivian Wang, Elaine Yu and Tiffany May","['HONG KONG — A barge draped with enormous red banners celebrating China’s new security law was sailing across Hong Kong’s famed Victoria Harbor only hours after the legislation passed. The police now hoist a purple sign warning protesters that their chants could be criminal. Along major roads throughout the city, neon-colored flags hailing a new era of stability and prosperity stand erect as soldiers. In recent days, as China took a victory lap over the law it imposed on the city Tuesday, the defiant masses who once filled Hong Kong’s streets in protest have largely gone quiet. Sticky notes that had plastered the walls of pro-democracy businesses vanished, taken down by owners suddenly fearful of the words scribbled on them. Parents whispered about whether to stop their children from singing a popular protest song, while activists devised coded ways to express now-dangerous ideas. Seemingly overnight, Hong Kong was visibly and viscerally different, its more than seven million people left to navigate what the law would mean to their lives. The territory’s distinct culture of political activism and free speech, at times brazenly directed at China’s ruling Communist Party, appeared to be in peril. For some who had been alarmed by the ferocity of last year’s unrest, which at times transformed shopping districts, neighborhoods and university campuses into smoke-filled battlefields, the law brought relief and optimism. For others, who had hoped the desperate protest campaign would help secure long-cherished freedoms, it signaled a new era of fear and uncertainty. “This is home,” said Ming Tse, sitting in the cafe he manages, which once loudly supported the protesters. “But I don’t think this place loves us anymore.” For months, Mr. Tse’s love for his home was advertised at his shop in the working-class neighborhood of North Point. The oat milk carton at the cash register sat behind postcards of protest art. A poster condemned the police shootings of two student demonstrators. Even after opponents of the movement threatened to vandalize the shop last fall, the decorations stayed. But on Thursday, Mr. Tse, 34, took everything down. News reports said police officers had interrogated owners of restaurants with similar protest paraphernalia. The security law criminalizes “subversion” of the government, a crime that the police say encompasses speech such as political slogans. All that remained was a small plastic dinosaur on the counter, wearing a yellow hard hat. That inexpensive yet tough headgear, worn by protesters who fought with the police, had become a symbol of their scrappy fortitude. “I don’t know if they are so sensitive,” Mr. Tse said. “It’s just a helmet on a dinosaur.” He paused, then reconsidered: “Actually, everything is sensitive.” That the lines of criminality had been redrawn became clear on Friday, when the authorities charged a 24-year-old man with terrorism and inciting separatism — the first person to be indicted under the new law. With a “Liberate Hong Kong” flag mounted on the back of his motorcycle, the man careened into a group of police officers on Wednesday, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China from British rule. Most years, that holiday draws large pro-democracy rallies. But this time, they were banned. Protests were scattered, and the police swept in and arrested hundreds. Ten people, including a 15-year-old girl, were accused of “inciting subversion,” a vaguely defined crime under the new law; some had merely waved flags, bearing slogans that had never been explicitly outlawed. A few dozen relatives and social workers waited on Thursday outside a police station in North Point where more than 100 of those arrested were being held. Such vigils had become a rite for protesters’ loved ones. But this one felt more perilous, with crimes under the security law punishable by life imprisonment in the most serious cases. A Chinese official said Wednesday that the law was meant to hang over would-be troublemakers like the sword of Damocles. The police collected DNA samples and searched the homes of the 10 people arrested on suspicion of inciting subversion — measures that seemed excessive when applied to people accused only of possessing pamphlets, said Janet Pang, a lawyer who is helping some of them. “You’re supposed to only use power that is necessary, and that’s how the law should be,” she said. Shortly after noon on Thursday, a pro-democracy activist, Tam Tak-chi, emerged from the station, where he had spent the night after being detained. Mr. Tam met a young man inside who said he had been arrested after the police found a banner in his bag reading “Hong Kong Independence, the Only Way Out.” The man wept on his shoulder, Mr. Tam said. The Hong Kong government has insisted that free speech is not under threat. But on Saturday, the city’s public library system said that books by some prominent activists had been removed from circulation while officials reviewed whether they violated the new law. The censorship has crept even into private homes. In June of last year, Katie Lam took her two young sons to a large rally. Her older son wore a cap that read “Hong Konger” and raised a handmade sign saying, “Don’t shoot us.” Now Ms. Lam, a data analyst, is anxious about what her sons say at home. One of them is having a birthday party in two weeks, and Ms. Lam wondered if she should hide a print displayed on the piano that reads “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times,” a slogan that the government says could be considered subversive. The boys loved singing “Glory to Hong Kong,” the unofficial anthem of the protest movement. She worries that the neighbors will hear it. “Even though we all knew it would happen one day,” she said of China’s intervention, “it’s still painful.” But in some corners of the city, China’s move has been welcome. The successive blows of the unrest, followed by the coronavirus pandemic, emptied malls and grounded flights, eviscerating Hong Kong’s economy. The security law, however unpopular, seemed poised to end the monthslong impasse over the protests. It was Hong Kong’s prosperity and worldliness that drew Harry He, 33, to the city from mainland China 10 years ago. He earned master’s degrees in finance and engineering and fell in love with his new home: its efficient public transportation, its high food-safety standards. He got married, found work as an insurance agent, bought a home, had a daughter. Last year shattered that serenity. Once, while he was eating at a restaurant with friends, masked protesters smashed a nearby sushi restaurant owned by a company seen as pro-Beijing, he said. His mainland clients began avoiding Hong Kong. Mr. He said he had supported the protesters at first. But he soon grew convinced that the authorities needed to restore stability, and that the security law would do so. “I just don’t want to see violence again,” he said in an interview in his office tower in Tsim Sha Tsui, a luxury shopping district that was battered by street fighting. “I just want Hong Kong to be as developed and prosperous as before.” Still, even some who embraced stability wondered about its price. Just as core to Hong Kong’s identity as its freewheeling capitalism has been its proud, even gleeful, outspokenness. Street booths often lined the city’s busiest shopping districts, blasting dueling political messages. Tiny bookstores crammed into overpriced commercial spaces hawked volumes that were banned in the mainland. Xu Zhe, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, said the law was needed to address the “terrorism” committed by some protesters. He had been horrified by a clash in November, when some demonstrators poured gasoline on a man who had scolded them, then set him ablaze. But Mr. Xu also worried that the law could be used to clamp down on dissent, including speech. Mr. Xu, who grew up on the mainland before attending university in Hong Kong, had never had a chance to protest at home. Last year, he attended his first demonstration, a small gathering against violence. If Hong Kongers lost the right to protest, he said, “I would feel deeply, deeply regretful.” Few people in the city know the price of protest better than Rowena He, a historian at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Professor He has studied the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, when Chinese troops gunned down protesters in Beijing. Her office is an informal museum of the massacre, with a miniature replica on her bookshelf of the “Goddess of Democracy” statue that the Tiananmen protesters erected shortly before the killings. On Wednesday, the day after the security law was enacted, one of Professor He’s students decided to walk around Hong Kong, documenting a city on the cusp of change. He sent her a photo of a row of Chinese flags, flapping in the wind. On a sidewalk railing nearby, a banner supporting a pastor imprisoned on the mainland had been ripped in half. “You are a real historian,” Professor He responded. Even as old markers of resistance have come down, subtler ones have surfaced. Some protesters have turned to puns and created new meaning from well-worn phrases, a tactic long adopted by mainland internet users to skirt government censorship. On Wednesday, in one of the city’s commercial hubs, someone had spray-painted “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves” — the opening line of China’s national anthem. And one shop, in place of protest slogans, hung up nearly two dozen posters of propaganda from Mao-era China, including one that proclaimed: “Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is reasonable.” Bella Huang contributed research.']","In a city where China has made some ideas suddenly dangerous, people are trying to figure out where the boundaries lie, and how their lives have changed."
Europe’s Roma Already Faced Discrimination. The Pandemic Made It Worse.,2020-07-06,By Patrick Kingsley and Boryana Dzhambazova,"['KYUSTENDIL, Bulgaria — At a checkpoint on the edge of a Roma neighborhood, a police officer held up his hand, stopping Angel Iliev from leaving. Water was running low at home, so Mr. Iliev, 49, had cycled down a bumpy, dusty track that connects the district with a wealthier part of town, hoping to fill two plastic jerrycans at a spring beyond the checkpoint. But while the rest of the city — like the rest of Bulgaria — is emerging from a lockdown put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic, the 12,000 residents of this Roma suburb are not allowed to leave their segregated settlement. Although its lockdown is scheduled to end at the start of Wednesday, municipal officials have already extended it once and could decide to prolong it again. Last week, the police officer was in no mind to bend the rules, sending Mr. Iliev back into the ghetto with his jerrycans empty. “It’s pure prejudice,” Mr. Iliev said before cycling home. “The discrimination was already bad, but now it’s even worse because of the pandemic.” The authorities in Kyustendil justify the lockdown as a medical response to a spike in coronavirus cases in the Roma suburb. But for many Roma, it is the latest example of centuries-old bigotry that has deepened in several parts of Europe since the start of the pandemic. In Bulgaria, at least seven Roma settlements have been shut off from the rest of society at various points since March, despite low rates of confirmed infections in most of them. Officials in one town even sprayed disinfectant on a Roma settlement from a plane. Five Roma towns were cordoned off in Slovakia, according to research by Amnesty International. In Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, the Netherlands and North Macedonia, there have been 15 incidents of police violence against Roma since Europe’s lockdowns began, including against young children, according to research shared with The New York Times by the European Roma Rights Center, a Brussels-based watchdog. In Belgium, two groups of Roma were made homeless in April after the police confiscated their four caravans on accusations of violating coronavirus restrictions. “It’s a perfect storm,” said Jonathan Lee, a spokesman for the European Roma Rights Center. “The coronavirus measures have exacerbated the level of institutional racism that was already prevalent throughout institutions and police forces across Europe.” A catchall term for several minorities, the Roma are descendants of people who left the Indian subcontinent about 1,500 years ago and later migrated in large numbers from Asia Minor to Europe during medieval times, just as the Ottoman Empire began expanding in that direction. Settling across the continent, they have faced persecution and discrimination ever since. Sometimes known as Gypsies, Roma were targeted in medieval pogroms and enslaved until the 19th century. Hundreds of thousands were killed in the Holocaust. At least 10 million Roma people now live in Europe, many of them in overcrowded, segregated communities, often with limited access to health care, education and basic amenities like water and electricity. In the Roma suburb in Kyustendil, most roads are unpaved and strewn with garbage. A wall separates part of the settlement from a nearby road, obscuring it from residents on the other side. With no access to computers and high-speed broadband during the pandemic, Roma children have struggled to take part in internet-based learning, falling even further behind. Across Europe, more than 80 percent of Roma are at risk of poverty, nearly half do not finish school, roughly a third lack running water and a third are unemployed, according to research published by the European Union in 2016. “Roma represent one of the most disadvantaged minorities in Europe,” said Jelena Sesar, a Balkans researcher for Amnesty International. In some countries, they are not only neglected by prominent lawmakers, but also singled out for prejudice. The leader of a junior party in Bulgaria’s governing coalition, Valeri Simeonov, once described Roma as “feral humanoids.” He later briefly led a state-run integration authority. The deputy prime minister, Krasimir Karakachanov, called them “unsocialized gypsies,” a term that critics said echoed the Nazi term “asocial gypsies.” In April, a member of the European Parliament from Mr. Karakachanov’s party, Angel Dzhambazki, said that the rest of the population needed to be protected from Roma people, who in 2011 formed about 5 percent of Bulgaria’s population of 7.4 million, according to a census that year. (Some researchers believe the Roma population is up to twice as big.) Against this backdrop, the municipal authorities in Kyustendil, a city in western Bulgaria, locked down its Roma suburb on June 17. Residents were barred from leaving unless they could convince the police that they had a job to attend or an urgent medical emergency. In reality, that meant that most residents have remained stuck inside, since few have formal employment contracts. Kyustendil’s mayor, Petar Paunov, said the decision was straightforward. After the national lockdown was lifted in early June, Roma residents returned home from elsewhere in Europe. To celebrate their homecoming, two men held a celebration in the neighborhood. Some attendees are believed to have spread the virus, several residents said, leading to a surge of roughly 100 cases and prompting officials to act. “Neither I nor the doctors want to shut down anyone,” Mr. Paunov said. But “the reality right now is that if the situation continues, then the doctors in the hospital won’t be able to cope.” Yet for many residents and activists, the measure feels hypocritical and unfair. Elsewhere in the country, non-Roma areas with similar caseloads, like the town of Smolyan in southern Bulgaria, have not been subject to the same restrictions. At the final of a national soccer competition last week, thousands of soccer fans were allowed to gather without social distancing. Even in Mr. Paunov’s City Hall, employees have walked around without masks, despite signs asking visitors to do so. Elsewhere in Kyustendil, high school proms continued as usual. There is little doubt that the lockdown has inflicted added hardship on an already neglected Roma population. “They don’t care about us,” said Vasil Todorov, a 26-year-old resident. “They’re just afraid they’ll get sick themselves.” Because most residents are not allowed to leave the settlement, they can use only the shops and services within it, and that has driven up the cost of buying food. Products at the local grocers are about a fifth more expensive than in town, residents say. It is also harder to withdraw money (the A.T.M. ran out of bank notes), pay utility bills (the shop that houses the billing system is shut), visit the bank (which is in the center of the city) and buy medicine: The single local pharmacy lacks some prescription medicines and is hugely oversubscribed, leading to hourlong lines. To get access to pharmacies beyond the police checkpoints, residents need a note from their doctor. But some doctors live outside the area and therefore cannot be reached. And one of the two resident doctors was himself sick for at least a week, putting him out of action. Even the available doctor is not an option for about half the residents: Roughly 50 percent of Bulgarian Roma do not have state health insurance and therefore are unable to register with a general practitioner. “The whole goal of shutting down a neighborhood is to prevent the spread of the virus,” said Tsveta Petkova, a board member of a national network of health advisers who work within Roma communities. Yet in lockdowns like the one in Kyustendil, Ms. Petkova added, “residents were left virtually without access to health care.” In June, when one 72-year-old resident, Zafir Dimitrov, fell ill with coronavirus symptoms, his friends called for an ambulance. But the ambulance operators refused to come, telling them to contact the man’s general practitioner instead, according to a video of the telephone call seen by The Times. Mr. Dimitrov’s doctor was unreachable, which delayed his treatment, said a community leader who was present for the call. Within a few days, Mr. Dimitrov was dead.']","Roma people in a Bulgarian town are barred from leaving their neighborhood. Officials cite a medical risk, but residents and advocates say it’s yet another form of bigotry."
Laid Off and Locked Up: Virus Traps Domestic Workers in Arab States,2020-07-06,By Ben Hubbard and Louise Donovan,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — When the nine African women lost their jobs as domestic workers in Saudi Arabia because of the coronavirus lockdown, the agency that had recruited them stuffed them in a bare room with a few thin mattresses and locked the door. Some have been there since March. One is now six months pregnant but receiving no maternity care. Another tore her clothes off in a fit of distress, so the agency chained her to a wall. The women receive food once a day, they said, but don’t know when they will get out, much less be able to return to their countries. “Everybody is fearing,” one of the women, Apisaki, from Kenya, said via WhatsApp. “The environment here is not good. No one will listen to our voice.” Families in many Arab countries rely on millions of low-paid workers from Asia and Africa to drive their cars, clean their homes and care for their children and elderly relatives under conditions that rights groups have long said allow exploitation and abuse. Now, the pandemic and associated economic downturns have exacerbated these dangers. Many families will not let their housekeepers leave the house, fearing they will bring back the virus, while requiring them to work more since entire families are staying home, workers’ advocates say. Other workers have been laid off, deprived of wages and left stranded far from home with nowhere to turn for help. In Lebanon, employers have deposited scores of Ethiopian women in front of their country’s consulate in Beirut because they could no longer pay them as the economy imploded. Persian Gulf countries alone had nearly four million domestic laborers in 2016, more than half of them women, according to a study for the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, which focuses on migrant labor in the region. Experts say the real number has risen since and is probably much higher. Hundreds of thousands of foreign housekeepers and nannies work in other Arab countries, including Lebanon and Jordan, giving the Arab world the most female domestic migrant workers of any region, according to the International Labor Organization. Most come to the Middle East through recruitment agencies and are employed under a sponsorship system that links their residency status to their jobs, giving their employers tremendous power. In many cases, they cannot quit without losing their residency, or move to new jobs or leave the country without an employer’s permission.  And in practice, many employers confiscate workers’ passports  and deprive them of time off, rights groups say. Some prevent them from using cellphones or the internet. Physical and sexual abuse are common. The combination of their gender, the sponsorship system and their isolation  makes female domestic workers especially vulnerable, said Vani Saraswathi, associate editor of Migrant-Rights.org, an advocacy group.  “You have this person who controls your every movement, and you are in their house 24-7,” she said, “so imagine the kind of power that gives them.” Alarm among such workers rose as Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, spread across the Middle East and shook the economies many migrants depend on. “Even in cases of extreme abuse, workers are hesitant to leave their employers, as they fear being made completely homeless,” Ms. Saraswathi said. Dozens of Kenyan women in Saudi Arabia have complained of “not enough food, no rest, violence, even being threatened, trapped and monitored,” said Ruth Khakame, chairwoman of the National Domestic Workers Council of Kudheiha, a Kenyan union. “You’re being denied from using your phone. So you’re struggling, you’re alone and you’ve nowhere to turn.” Fear of contagion has upset relations between many domestic workers and their employers. Some who used to get breaks when their employers left for the office now have to serve and clean up after entire families stuck at home all day. Other families distrust their workers as potential vectors for the virus. “From the beginning, my employers were not friendly,” said Justine Mukisa, 33, a Ugandan working in Oman. But during the pandemic, her salary of about $180 per month has been cut in half, her workload has increased and her employers have grown hostile. “Before coronavirus, we sometimes played with the children,” she said. “Now this is not allowed. My employers do not want me to touch their food or sit near them.” In recent years, a number of countries have passed regulations regarding domestic workers, granting them one day off each week, annual or biannual leave and an end-of-service benefit based on length of employment. Qatar has capped the workday at 10 hours, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait at 12 hours and Saudi Arabia at 15 hours. Kuwait has a monthly minimum wage of about $195 for domestic workers. Kenyans in Saudi Arabia are supposed to earn at least $375 per month plus benefits, and the Philippines has set a $400 minimum wage for its citizens across countries. As the coronavirus has spread, Bahrain, Kuwait and the Emirates have facilitated visa renewals to stranded migrants to help them avoid fines and detention if their residency status lapses. Qatar and Saudi Arabia have announced free treatment for migrant workers who get Covid-19. But workers’ advocates say that enforcement of regulations is often spotty and that those who face abuse have little recourse. “The way these countries have perfected this system of disposable labor lends itself to a high level of exploitation,” said Mustafa Qadri, the executive director of Equidem, a labor rights organization based in Britain.  Those who get the virus can be easily discarded by their employers. Two months ago, Hanico Quinlat, a Filipino domestic worker in Saudi Arabia, came down with a severe headache and moved into her agency’s hostel to recover. When she tested positive for Covid-19, the agency supervisor locked her in a room alone, giving her only painkillers and vitamin C to treat her illness. “When they give us food, they throw it into the room,” Ms. Quinlat said by telephone from the room where she was being held. “We are people, not animals.” Among the most vulnerable workers are women who have fled their employers or entered countries on tourist visas, hoping to freelance. Kelleh Njoki, 25, arrived in Dubai from Kenya as a tourist in February seeking work, but soon discovered she was pregnant. She is now sleeping in a crowded private dorm and cannot afford maternity care or a $400 repatriation flight. “I’m seven months pregnant; how am I going to have my baby here?” she said in a phone interview. “I’m stuck. I’m confused. I really need help.” For Apisaki, the Kenyan locked up with eight other women in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, the trouble started when she left her job last month after not being paid for months and returned to her recruiting agency, she said. She was soon held with others from Kenya and Uganda who also had no work and no way to get home because of the lockdown — and because the agency had taken their passports. The New York Times verified the details of the women’s confinement through interviews with two women in the room, including Apisaki, who is being identified only by her middle name for her safety, and videos she shared showing their conditions. The women are in a single room whose only sunlight comes from a small window that was recently taped shut. They share a toilet, wash clothes in the sink and cook one meal per day when the agency drops off food. The pregnant woman hasn’t seen a doctor in months, Apisaki said, and the woman who tore off her clothes spent weeks lying naked on the tile, her arm chained to the wall. New arrivals are not tested for the coronavirus, potentially endangering the others in a country recording thousands of new cases daily. For the Kenyan women, the agency that recruited them in Kenya is responsible for helping them return home. But the agency that recruited Apisaki is no longer answering its phone or responding to messages, she said. Last week, the Kenyan Embassy in Riyadh announced a possible repatriation flight to Nairobi but said travelers had to prove they did not have Covid-19, buy a $525 ticket and quarantine once home. But Apisaki can’t get tested or fly if she can’t leave the room, and her efforts to reach the embassy have failed, she said. The women said they had been locked up by their Saudi agency, Almuhait Recruitment. It did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. In an emailed response to questions, Peter Ogego, the Kenyan ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said that he was alarmed by the “serious allegations” of the women’s detention and that he would work with the Saudi government “to bring justice to the victims and address the loopholes in the law and any underlying causes.” But he said it was Saudi Arabia’s job to ensure the safety of foreigners working there and questioned Apisaki’s inability to reach embassy officials. “Much of our work is daily spent largely addressing such allegations,” he wrote. After The New York Times contacted Almuhait Recruitment about the women’s situation on Sunday, Apisaki told an associate outside of Saudi Arabia that several of the women, including the pregnant woman, had been taken to a hospital for medical checkups and Covid-19 tests. “They can’t hold women without any right,” Apisaki said. “I don’t get sun to my body, no space to stretch my legs, to walk or exercise. These are the things that make my brain crazy.” Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, Lebanon, and Louise Donovan from London. Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut.

"Bubonic Plague Found in a Herder in Inner Mongolia, China Says",2020-07-06,By Austin Ramzy,"['A herdsman in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia was confirmed to be infected with bubonic plague, health officials said, a reminder of how even as the world battles a pandemic caused by a novel virus, old threats remain. The Bayannur city health commission said the plague was diagnosed in the herdsman on Sunday, and he was in stable condition undergoing treatment at a hospital. The commission also issued a third-level alert, the second lowest in a four-level system, warning people against hunting, eating or transporting potentially infected animals, particularly marmots, and to report any dead or diseased rodents. The city government said it had put in place plague-prevention measures that would remain in force for the rest of the year. The disease, which caused the Black Death in the Middle Ages, is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium and is transmitted by fleas that become infected by rodents. In Inner Mongolia, the host is often marmots that live in rural areas. In November, Beijing officials said two people from Inner Mongolia were found to have pneumonic plague, another form of plague caused by the same bacterium. Pneumonic plague is the only form that can be transmitted person to person, through respiratory droplets. If not treated, pneumonic plague is invariably fatal, while bubonic plague is fatal in about 30 percent to 60 percent of untreated cases, the World Health Organization says. Antibiotics can cure the disease if delivered early. The neighboring country of Mongolia was also investigating a suspected case of bubonic plague involving a 15-year-old, who had apparently been in contact with a marmot hunted by a dog, The Global Times said on Twitter. On Monday, Mongolia announced that it had lifted restrictions in Khovd Province after two cases of bubonic plague linked to the consumption of marmot meat were reported a week ago. Health officials said the patients’ conditions had improved, the Ikon.mn news site reported. Plague cases are found in limited numbers across much of the world. In the United States, about seven cases, usually the bubonic form, are reported on average each year, most often in rural areas of western states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.']","A city put control measures in place after one confirmed case of the disease, which caused the Black Death in the Middle Ages."
Russian Court Convicts Journalist for ‘Justifying Terrorism’,2020-07-06,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Further tightening the screws on free speech in Russia just days after a national plebiscite effectively entrenched Vladimir V. Putin as president for life, a Russian military court on Monday convicted a freelance journalist on charges of “justifying terrorism” in a 2018 text critical of the security services. The court in Pskov, an ancient city near Russia’s border with Estonia, sentenced the journalist, Svetlana Prokopyeva, to a fine of about $7,000 and ordered the confiscation of her computer and cellphone. Prosecutors had asked for a six-year jail sentence, so the punishment was less severe than the journalist and her supporters had feared, but the guilty verdict nonetheless sent a chilling message. Lev Shlosberg, the Pskov region leader of Yabloko, a liberal opposition party, and a supporter of the journalist, described the verdict as “an achievement for civil society but not a victory.” The authorities, he said in a telephone interview, had backed away from a harsh prison sentence under public pressure, “but they still declared an innocent person guilty because they can never acknowledge that the security services are ever wrong. If they do that, the whole system crumbles.” Even the Kremlin’s own human rights council had denounced the charges as unwarranted, adding its voice to a chorus of support for Ms. Prokopyeva in what became a battle of wills between an impecunious local reporter and Russia’s powerful security apparatus. Her conviction indicated that, despite a resounding vote of public support last week for constitutional amendments intended to let Mr. Putin rule until 2036, the Kremlin is in no mood to tolerate criticism of the security agencies that anchor Russia’s increasingly authoritarian system. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday that he could not comment on the verdict because Russian courts act independently from the Kremlin, despite ample evidence that officials often dictate court decisions in a system known as telephone justice. In her final statement to the court on Friday, Ms. Prokopyeva rejected the charges against her as “absurd,” noting that her work posed no danger to anyone and blaming the authorities for stoking violence by cracking down on dissent. “It is state power that has fallen into the hands of cruel and cynical people that represents the most serious threat to the security of citizens,” she said. The case against Ms. Prokopyeva revolved around a brief commentary she wrote in 2018 after a Russian teenager, a self-declared anarchist, blew himself up inside a branch of the secret police in Arkhangelsk, near the Arctic Circle. She held the government responsible for the attack, which killed only the 17-year-old bomber, arguing that nonviolent means of protest like street protests had been steadily closed off by often violent security officers. “Cruelty breeds cruelty,” the journalist said in her commentary, which was broadcast on the Pskov affiliate of Ekho Moskvy, a Moscow radio station, and also published on the internet. The terrorism-related charges brought against Ms. Prokopyeva drew widespread scorn and dismay, including from Mr. Putin’s human rights council, which declared last year that it had “carefully studied” the text at the center of the case and “did not see in it any signs of justification of terrorism.” Soon after giving its opinion, the human rights council was purged of its more independent-minded members and stacked with Kremlin loyalists.']",The case against the freelance reporter revolved around a 2018 text critical of the security services.

"Britain, Charting Its Own Course on Human Rights, Imposes New Sanctions",2020-07-06,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Britain, seeking to carve out a post-Brexit role as a human-rights defender, said on Monday it had blacklisted dozens of people from Russia, Saudi Arabia and Myanmar for abuses ranging from a carefully-plotted execution to jailhouse beatings and the persecution of Rohingya refugees. It was the first time since leaving the European Union in January that Britain imposed its own sanctions for human-rights violations. British officials cast the move as proof that the country can play an influential global role on its own, with some noting that the European Union has yet to adopt similar sanctions. Among the 47 people who face travel bans and frozen assets in Britain are 25 Russians accused of aiding and abetting in the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky and 20 Saudis accused in the assassination of the dissident Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi. It also sanctioned two high-ranking generals from Myanmar and two North Korean organizations responsible for the isolated country’s brutal prison system. Mr. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer, died after brutal treatment while in detention on false charges in 2009, and is the namesake for the Magnitsky Act, under which the United States blacklists human rights abusers. Mr. Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, at the hands of Saudi agents. “As we forge a dynamic new vision for a truly global Britain, this government is absolutely committed to the United Kingdom being an even stronger force for good in the world,” the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said in Parliament, using a phrase he and other Brexiteers coined to describe the international role that they hoped a newly independent Britain would play. “If you’re a kleptocrat or an organized criminal,” Mr. Raab added, “you will not be able to launder your blood money in this country.” As a practical matter, being on Britain’s blacklist will probably do little to change the lives of the people whose names were included in the announcement. The British government drew its first batch of names from individuals already blacklisted by the United States. That means they are already effectively banned from dealing with British banks, since the Treasury Department enforces its measures globally through the threat of secondary sanctions. Still, Britain’s use of human rights sanctions gives it a weapon that it could apply more widely in the future, including against Chinese officials involved in the country’s mass internment of Uighurs or the recent crack down on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Conservative lawmakers pressed Mr. Raab about why the list did not include any Chinese officials, and he replied that the government would continue to add names. But analysts said they did not expect Britain to designate Chinese officials, given the complex commercial ties between the two countries. Britain has been involved in a brewing clash with China since the Chinese government imposed a new national security law over Hong Kong in June. Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticized the move and invited nearly three million people in the former British colony — those who hold British overseas passports — to live and work in Britain. A onetime human-rights lawyer, Mr. Raab has lobbied for Britain to adopt Magnitsky-style sanctions since he was on the Conservative backbench in Parliament. Britain passed the necessary legislation two years ago but held off designating anyone on the list until after it formally left the European Union. Mr. Raab paid tribute to the memory of Mr. Magnitsky and afterward met at the Foreign Office with the lawyer’s widow, Natalia, and his son, Nikita, as well as with William F. Browder, an American-born British financier who employed Mr. Magnitsky and has long campaigned for British sanctions in his name. “Britain has an outsized role in this area because most tin-pot dictators have bought mansions here, send their kids to boarding school here and kept their money here,” Mr. Browder said. “Any sanctions on those things has a very chilling effect for all these bad guys around the world.” London has long been a preferred sanctuary for unsavory people with unlimited means. Many own apartments or houses in Chelsea or Belgravia, affluent neighborhoods in West London, and send their children to exclusive British schools, and, as Mr. Raab put it, “do their Christmas shopping in Knightsbridge.” Among those on the blacklist are Aleksey Vasilyevich Anichin and Oleg Silchenko, who served on an Interior Ministry committee that investigated Mr. Magnitsky on trumped-up charges. Both are accused of taking part in his mistreatment and ignoring signs of his deteriorating condition while in a Moscow prison. Among the Saudis named are Ahmed al-Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who some have accused of ordering Mr. Khashoggi’s killing. Both men have been indicted in Istanbul and will stand trial in absentia for directing the 15-man hit squad that flew to Turkey from Saudi Arabia to carry out the killing. Mr. Raab said he hoped the European Union would follow Britain’s lead. But there was more than a hint of satisfaction in his tone. Britain had broken free from the need for consensus, which has so far prevented the 27-member bloc from agreeing to such sanctions. Hungary has been among those who have balked at them. “Even if they have a human rights sanctions regime in place, would they use it like the U.S. or U.K.?” said Emil Dall, an expert in sanctions at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London. “What we often see in the E.U. is a lowest common denominator when it comes to sanctions.”']","Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced that dozens of people from Russia and Saudi Arabia would be added to a blacklist, but China was notably absent."
"Iran Admits Serious Damage to Natanz Nuclear Site, Setting Back Program",2020-07-05,"By Farnaz Fassihi, Richard Pérez-Peña and Ronen Bergman","['A fire at Iran’s main nuclear fuel enrichment site caused significant damage, setting back the country’s nuclear program by months, the government acknowledged on Sunday, after initially saying the destruction was minor. A Middle Eastern intelligence official with knowledge of the episode said Israel was responsible for the attack on the Natanz nuclear complex on Thursday, using a powerful bomb. A member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who was briefed on the matter also said an explosive was used. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing sensitive intelligence and operational topics. Suspicion in Iran has focused on Israel and the United States, which have sabotaged the nuclear program in the past and have vowed to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In the past, Israel and the United States have used cyberattacks to damage Iran’s nuclear program, but that has been ruled out as a cause in this case, the Revolutionary Guards member said. Though there was no way to verify its involvement independently, Israel’s intelligence network has shown its ability to strike in the heart of Iran, breaking into a warehouse in Tehran in 2018 and stealing half a ton of secret records documenting Iran’s nuclear project and spiriting them out of the country. Many of these records were given by Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, to the International Atomic Energy Agency, with many new clues of where Iran might be hiding forbidden equipment and raw material. If the damage at Natanz was an attack by a foreign power, it reinforces Iran’s vulnerability as its economy is strangled by sanctions imposed by a hostile Trump administration and its population is ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic. Tehran is increasingly isolated internationally; even countries that have opposed U.S. action against Iran recently joined in accusing it of hiding nuclear activity from international inspectors. Israeli officials were vague on Sunday when asked about the possibility of involvement in an attack on Natanz, though they stressed the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran. “Everyone can suspect us in everything and all the time, but I don’t think that’s correct,” Defense Minister Benny Gantz said on Sunday in a radio interview with Kan, the state broadcaster. “Not every event that happens in Iran is necessarily related to us,” he added, while not denying involvement in the Natanz explosion. Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, at a conference on Sunday held by the newspapers Maariv and The Jerusalem Post, said, “Iran cannot be allowed to have nuclear capabilities.” To that end, he said, “we take actions that are better left unsaid.” In recent months there have been dozens of episodes, including fires, at industrial complexes in Iran, and those, too, have been widely attributed to Israel. Just since Thursday, explosions occurred at two power plants in Iran, and there was a chlorine gas leak at a chemical plant, all of which the government described as accidents. The previous week, an explosion hit a missile production facility at the Khojir military complex in eastern Tehran, which officials said was caused by a gas tank’s detonating. The Middle Eastern intelligence official who said Israel was responsible for the explosion on Thursday also said it had nothing to do with the other recent incidents. Iranian officials have said publicly that they know what caused the damage at Natanz, but that they are withholding the information for now. Iran is using high-speed centrifuges to process, or enrich, uranium. Uranium enriched to lower levels is used in nuclear reactors, but highly enriched uranium can be fuel for an atomic bomb. Work has been underway at Natanz to build more advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium much more quickly. “It’s possible that this incident will slow down the development and expansion of advanced centrifuges,” Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told the official Islamic Republic News Agency on Sunday. “There were advanced equipment and precision measurement devices at this site that were either destroyed or damaged.” He cited “significant financial damage,” and said that the delay could be several months, but that no one was injured. “The damaged warehouse was designed for the final stages of advanced centrifuges and assembly of these machineries,” Mr. Kamalvandi said. While investigators have considered the possibility that Natanz was hit on Thursday by a cruise missile or a drone, they view it as more likely that someone carried a bomb into the building, the Revolutionary Guards member said. They do not yet know how or when the explosives were sneaked in, but the attack clearly demonstrated a hole in the facility’s security, he said. The episode will probably accelerate plans to move more of Iran’s most sensitive facilities underground, he added. Under the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States, China, Russia and European powers, Iran agreed to give up much of its enriched uranium and to limit the level of enrichment and the number of centrifuges it operated. But since President Trump withdrew from the deal and imposed damaging sanctions on Iran, it has ramped up the enrichment program far beyond the limits imposed by the agreement.']",A Middle Eastern intelligence official said Israel planted a bomb in a building where advanced centrifuges were being developed.
An Ancient Valley Lost to ‘Progress’,2020-07-05,By Carlotta Gall and Mauricio Lima,"['In his push for economic development, Turkey’s president has flooded the archaeological gem of Hasankeyf and displaced thousands of families. By Carlotta Gall Photographs by Mauricio Lima HASANKEYF, Turkey — There was something exceptional about Hasankeyf that made visitors fall in love with the town on first sight. Graced with mosques and shrines, it lay nestled beneath great sandstone cliffs on the banks of the River Tigris. Gardens were filled with figs and pomegranates, and vine-covered teahouses hung over the water. The golden cliffs, honeycombed with caves, are thought to have been used in Neolithic times. An ancient fortress marked what was once the edge of the Roman Empire. The ruins of a medieval bridge recalled when the town was a wealthy trading center on the Silk Road. Now it is all lost forever, submerged beneath the rising waters of the Ilisu Dam, the latest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s megaprojects, which flooded 100 miles of the upper Tigris River and its tributaries, including the once-stunning valley. I visited the area repeatedly with the photographer Mauricio Lima for half a year to witness the disappearance of the valley unfold in slow motion. The steadily expanding reservoir displaced more than 70,000 anguished inhabitants. Unexplored archaeological riches were swallowed up along with farms and homes. The waters have rendered Hasankeyf an irretrievable relic of the bygone civilizations that had been similarly drawn to the beauty of the valley, carved over millenniums by one of the Middle East’s greatest rivers. When Mr. Erdogan turned on the first turbine of the hydroelectric dam, celebrating the project’s completion in May, the president had his eye on more immediate concerns, but also on future glories, promising that it would bring peace and prosperity to southeastern Turkey. “The wind of peace, brotherhood and prosperity that will blow from the Ilisu Dam will be felt in these lands for centuries,” he told the ceremony via video link. The dam would contribute billions to the economy and irrigate thousands of hectares of farmland, he said. Government officials have emphasized that hydropower offered their greenest option when they decided to push ahead with the dam a dozen years ago, allowing Turkey to reduce its dependence on imported coal and gas. But many who lost their homes and livelihoods say they were never really consulted. They are bitter and traumatized. Environmentalists and archaeologists, in Turkey and abroad, are angry and frustrated, too, at the loss of the valley and its treasures. Their efforts to save Hasankeyf collapsed in the face of Mr. Erdogan’s increasing authoritarianism. International law, lagging behind the shifting attitudes around climate change and the value of protecting the environment, was inadequate for safeguarding the cultural heritage, they say. Zeynep Ahunbay, a conservation architect, campaigned for more than a decade to save Hasankeyf, not only for its archaeological gems but also for the value of its ancient natural setting. “You see this valley, it is so impressive,” Ms. Ahunbay said, describing what it was like to round the hillside and see Hasankeyf come into view. “You see this river cutting the rock and it goes down and down, and in the end you have the citadel of Hasankeyf. It is really marvelous, and nature and man have formed this place.” “To disturb or change the natural process of the river is also criminal,” she said. “You lose the beauty, you lose history, you lose nature. You are a loser all the time.” When Mr. Erdogan first announced his determination to build the dam, he championed it not only for the energy it would provide Turkey’s expanding economy but also for the development it would bring to the impoverished and insurgency-riven southeast. The dam is part of the massive Southeastern Anatolia Project irrigation plan that was begun in the 1980s. When the plan was first conceived in the 1950s there was little thought of its impact on the environment or on those who would be forced to leave. But as Turkey developed democratically, opponents of the dam began organizing. International activist organizations became involved, too, challenging international investors over concerns about the environmental impact, the loss of cultural heritage and the damage to communities downstream in Iraq and Syria. Ms. Ahunbay did not oppose the dam itself, but campaigned to preserve Hasankeyf and resisted a plan to move the ancient monuments to higher ground and to entomb one in concrete. As president of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, an international professional association that works to protect cultural heritage sites, she and a group of colleagues took the case to the European Court of Human Rights. They lost in the end because none of the plaintiffs were residents of Hasankeyf. The protest campaigns had early success in 2009, pushing several European partners to withdraw financing mainly because Turkey did not meet the requirements of social impact assessments. But Mr. Erdogan was undeterred. He ordered Turkish banks to step in and finance the project instead. Money seemed no object. The government built two new towns to relocate those displaced, and new highways and bridges to skirt the reservoir. Turkish companies, closely allied to Mr. Erdogan’s government, won the building contracts. The project had become a moneymaking exercise, a local bureaucrat said, asking that he not be identified by name for fear of reprisals from the government. “They spent a horrendous amount of money,” said Emin Bulut, a local journalist and activist, who said the bill ran to trillions of lira. “They could have fixed all the problems of the south with that.” In 2012, government officials arrived to begin evaluating property that would be submerged to compensate those who would be displaced. But the money became a source of resentment, dividing the community, and even families, and raising accusations of corruption. The arguments broke apart any unified opposition to the dam. “We surrendered when they came to measure the houses,” said Birsen Argun, 44, who together with her husband ran the Hasbahce Hotel, the only hotel in Hasankeyf, set in a garden of pomegranate and walnut trees along the river. “We brought it upon ourselves.” Her husband tried to persuade his brothers to refuse the money and fight for a bigger payment in the courts but they accepted the payout. People withdrew the money from accounts without telling others, she added. Many of those who did try to organize a protest movement grew up in Hasankeyf, and were even born in the cave homes of the citadel, like Arif Ayhan, 44, who started out selling old coins to tourists and then became a rug dealer. Politics split the campaign, he said, especially when supporters of the outlawed Kurdish movement, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, joined the rallies against the dam, chanting slogans and enraging the police. “This is why we failed,” he said. “We live in the most beautiful place in the world but we could not appreciate the value of this place.” After years of warnings, the end came suddenly. Last August, the government closed the dam gates and released waters from a reservoir upriver. Families scrambled to move out of villages, abandoning homesteads, selling off livestock and even hastily building new houses and access roads on higher ground. “We hoped the water would not come,” said Remziye Nas, mother of four, in the village of Bzere, where the water was lapping below her house. “We did not believe it would be flooded.” In the small town of Temelli, perched above the dam, Hezni Aksu, 60, looked down from his terrace to where his family’s farmhouse and lands were among the first to go under water. “This land was from our ancestors,” he said bitterly. His son was now an unemployed construction worker. “They made migrants of us.” In Hasankeyf, under a heavy police presence, bulldozers demolished the old bazaar one weekend last November. As the ceiling caved in and dust fell in his shop, something snapped inside Mehmet Ali Aslankilic. With a shout he set fire to his belongings in a lone, anguished protest. “It was my uncle’s shop. I had been working there since I was a child,” he said afterward. “Burning my shop was the only way I could deal with this.” A few doors down, Mehmet Nuri Aydin, 42, packed his woven rugs of long sheep’s wool into sacks. “We don’t want to go but we have to,” he said, adding that few shopkeepers could afford the rents in the new town. There was no wider demonstration. Since a failed coup in 2016, Turkey has banned all protests, so the campaign to save Hasankeyf had long since petered out. Activists were even careful about what they posted on social media. Government officials kept photographers away. With the bazaar demolished, families started to load furniture onto trucks and move to specially built homes in the new town. They gathered up the last pomegranates from the trees and piles of firewood, some even wrenching off doors and window frames from their old homes. “Our hearts are burning,” said Celal Ozbey, a retired civil servant as his wife and sons carried out tables and bundles from the house. They had been assigned a house in the new town but he was not sure they would stay, or if economic life would revive. “Time will tell,” he said. Fatime Salkan had refused to leave the low-pitched stone house that belonged to her parents, overlooking the 15th century El-Rizk mosque. Officials warned her to move but she was among several dozen single people who, under a quirk of Turkish law, was not considered eligible for a new home. “They told me to leave many times,” she told me last November. “If an engineer comes, I will say I am going to swim.” She watched from her terrace in December when Dutch engineers lifted the last of the medieval monuments, the 1,700-ton El-Rizk mosque with its intricately carved portal, onto wheels and transported it across the river. They deposited it on a man-made hill beside the new town, where the government has assembled various salvaged monuments and built a modern replica of the medieval bridge. They look out of place on the bare hillside, which will be made into a new archaeological park. Archaeologists insist that monuments ideally should be preserved in their place, but concede that if there is no other option, it is better to save them somehow. For the purists, though, the new Hasankeyf is artificial and charmless. “The real history is down there and we are drowning it,” said Zulku Emer, 41, a master craftsman who was laying a cobbled street beside the new park. “That’s the Turkish way. We ruin something and then try and live in it.”']",
Italy’s Outdoor Summer Movies See Threat From Ailing Film Industry,2020-07-05,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — Since the dawn of cinema, Italy’s torrid summers have made outdoor movie showings under the stars a favorite entertainment choice of the season.  Even the first Venice Film Festival, in August 1932, was held on the terrace of the Hotel Excelsior at the Lido, the island just off the center of Venice. But this year, several nonprofit cultural and social organizations have struggled to get their summer film festivals going after film distributors refused to rent them many requested titles, from the Harry Potter series to “BlacKkKlansman” to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The reason? These nonprofit organizations screen films for free, even as Italy’s fabled film industry is reeling with many theaters closed because of the coronavirus. “We use cinema as an instrument of social cohesion, to try and build community and have a nice time together,” said Luca Sansone of the Laboratorio di Quartiere Giambellino Lorenteggio, a group that shows free films in a Milanese low-income neighborhood “where people don’t go to the movies because it costs too much.” Normally the Milan open air initiative screens 10 films during the summer. This year, it will  show only four, after five distributors for Universal, Warner Bros., Disney, 20th Century Fox and RAI Cinema refused to issue rights to films that Mr. Sansone’s organization had chosen with input from local residents, he said. “The distributors told us that if we show them for free, they can’t give us films,” he said. But those in the business say that the pandemic dealt such a blow that it put the survival of Italy’s film industry at risk, and that giving unfettered free access to films would only make matters worse. “We lost more than 30 million tickets and more than 200 million euros in takings, just in box office receipts,” not to mention the loss of income from food concessions and other revenues, said Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the association of cinema owners who control the country’s 4,000 movie screens. Film industry operators note that the free initiatives receive public funding or have sponsors. The stalemate is the latest chapter in a conflict that started heating up two years ago. It has also affected other groups that screen free films throughout Italy, including one that travels through small central Italian towns struck by recent earthquakes, and a Roman association that began by showing films in the capital’s trendy Trastevere neighborhood and now runs two other venues. Distributors denied so many films to “Piccolo America,” the Roman association, that it was forced to scrap retrospectives featuring the films of Sergio Leone, Kathryn Bigelow and Francis Ford Coppola, said Valerio Carocci, the association’s combative leader. Mr. Carocci and other organizers accuse ANEC, the association of cinema owners, and ANICA, the National Association of Cinema and Audiovisual Industries, of conspiring to undermine the free programming. The accusation triggered an investigation by Italian regulators that became public last month when the police raided offices in Rome. The ongoing investigation seeks to determine whether these associations engaged in anticompetitive behavior, breaching an EU law, or an Italian one. Both ANICA and ANEC have denied any wrongdoing. The clash over summer film is playing out against the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak and its economic ramifications. Like countless other sectors, the film industry and its players, from filmmakers to movie theater owners, have been left gasping ever since Italian cinemas shut their doors on March 8, shortly before the national lockdown. Even though cinema theaters were given the green light to reopen on June 15, only 540 cinemas have reopened under new safety and social distancing guidelines limiting such indoor spaces to 200 people. Many cinema owners say they cannot break even under such rules. The pandemic hit just a year after film industry associations and the culture ministry began promoting year-round movie attendance under the banner “Moviement.”  It worked, Mr. Lorini said: Theaters, traditionally closed during the summer, stayed open. And film attendance went up 45 percent between June and August 2019, boosting the industry’s annual revenues by 14 percent, despite new streaming services entering the Italian market. “We came from a good period of revitalization, and had a good sense of the future,” Mr. Lorini said. Despite subsidies from the Italian government to combat the pandemic’s effects, cinema owners are still struggling. And the organizers of the free summer festivals say they are collateral damage, unable to obtain the titles that they had sought. Mr. Carocci said distributors had denied the rights to more than 150 films that he had asked for. A request for Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” for the Guarimba Film Festival in the Calabrian seaside town of Amantea was one of around 60 titles that the organizers asked for but did not get. “We wanted to bring movies that weren’t so known here,” said Giulio Vita, the chief organizer of the festival. “We’re talking about quality films, not unfair competition.” “No one in Calabria goes to the cinema when it’s 50 degrees Celsius outside,” he added. Though many cinemas are now air-conditioned, traditionally Italians haven’t made them the summer hangout spots that they are in the United States and elsewhere. The distributors accused of denying access have mostly remained mum about the dispute. Representatives of Universal declined to comment. Representatives of Warner Bros. did not respond to request for comment. Representatives for the state broadcaster, Rai Cinema, and its distribution arm said they had granted rights for all films more than three years old. Others in the industry said that costly investments into making films need to be valued, and compensated. “It’s an error to propose culture and cinema at zero cost,” Alessandro Giacobbe, chief executive officer of Academy Two, a Genoa-based distribution company. “Especially this year, when cinemas have been closed for months and the industry in trouble,” he said. “The message that has to pass to the public is that films should not be seen for free, that unless you pay for culture, it will die,” Mr. Giacobbe said.']",A longstanding dispute between film distributors and associations that show outdoor films for free comes to a head as the industry reels from a post-coronavirus downturn.
"London Police Stop Star Athletes, Setting Off Racial Profiling Debate",2020-07-07,By Marc Santora,"['LONDON — The couple, a top British sprinter and a Portuguese track star, were driving their Mercedes through the elegant Maida Vale neighborhood in West London — their 3-month-old son in the back seat — when a police van appeared in their rearview mirror. The athletes, Bianca Williams, 26, and Ricardo dos Santos, 25, soon found themselves surrounded by officers before being hustled from their vehicle and placed in handcuffs as the police searched the car. Ms. Williams, a European and Commonwealth gold medalist in the 4x100-meter relay, accused the London Metropolitan Police of racial profiling, saying her family was targeted because they are Black and drive an expensive car. The police said in a statement that they had pulled over the car because officers “witnessed a vehicle with blacked-out windows that was driving suspiciously, including driving on the wrong side of the road.” The events, some of which were captured on shaky cellphone video and posted on social media, have renewed debate over police tactics in England at a moment of heightened awareness over institutional racism. In a series of interviews with British news outlets over the past three days, Ms. Williams disputed the police account, noting that she and her partner were driving on a single-lane road and were looking for a safe place to pull over. (It is common practice in Britain for drivers to park on either side of a residential street.) Ms. Williams said that the aggressiveness of the officers so unnerved her that she was scared to get out of the car. “My partner got dragged out of the car, they handcuffed him straight away and pinned him up against the wall,” Ms. Williams told the BBC. “I didn’t want to be separated from my 3-month-old son, and they then put me in handcuffs straight away too.” They were kept cuffed for about 45 minutes as the police searched the car, then were eventually released. “It’s a really sad world that we live in and if it’s not one Black man, it’s another Black man,” Ms. Williams said. “My heart just hurts.” A video of a brief part of the encounter was posted on Twitter by Linford Christie, an Olympic gold medalist who trained both Ms. Williams and Mr. Dos Santos, a Portuguese sprinter. “Racist police aren’t just in America,” he wrote in a post that quickly went viral. In the video, a woman can be heard pleading with officers that her child was in the car and that she did not want to be separated from him. In another video clip of the encounter, a female officer can be heard telling the woman to calm down and that no one wanted to harm her or her child. The police said in a statement that they had reviewed “footage from social media, and the body-worn video of the officers, and are satisfied that there is no concern around the officers’ conduct.” The local police commander in central-west London, Helen Harper, said in a statement that the police wanted to speak to the couple to better understand their concerns. “We want to listen to, and speak with, those who raise concerns, to understand more about the issues raised and what more we can do to explain police actions,” Ms. Harper said. “Where we could have interacted in a better way, we need to consider what we should have done differently and take on that learning for the future.” The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, told LBC radio that it was hard to see what justification there could have been for handcuffing the couple. “I don’t know what led to the stop in the first place,” he said. “But what I do know is that if I was a senior officer looking at that video footage, I would feel uncomfortable about the way that it was dealt with.” The British police have long employed “stop and search” tactics, long the subject of often bitter debate. Stops reached a peak in 2009, when the police searched about 1.5 million people or vehicles based on “reasonable grounds” of suspicion of possession of illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something that could be used to commit a crime. After dropping steadily for years, the stops increased 50 percent in London during the coronavirus lockdown, with 30,608 stops this past April compared to 20,981 over the same period in 2019. In June, as protests over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis spread around the world, many Britons pointed to the disproportionate number of searches in areas with large Black, Asian and minority ethnic populations as evidence of a systemic problem. According to official statistics, Black people are 10 times as likely to be stopped and searched than white people are.']","Bianca Williams, a European gold medalist, accused the officers of targeting her and her partner, a fellow sprinter, because they are Black and drive an expensive car."
"Seized by the Police, an Outspoken Chinese Professor Sees Fears Come True",2020-07-06,By Chris Buckley,"['The Chinese law professor had stored a few pairs of underwear and a toothbrush in a small bag, close at hand for the day when the police detained him for his unsparing criticism of the Communist Party under Xi Jinping. That day appears to have arrived. On Monday morning, the police showed up in force at the home of the scholar, Xu Zhangrun, in northern Beijing and took him away, according to three friends. He was detained on an accusation of consorting with prostitutes, according to Geng Xiaonan, a friend who said she had spoken to the scholar’s wife and students. “It’s just the kind of vile slander that they use against someone they want to silence,” said Ms. Geng, a businesswoman involved in film and publishing. “He foresaw this day,” she said. “He kept some clothes in a bag hanging inside his front door, so he wouldn’t have to go without a change when they took him away.” Professor Xu, 57, is one of the few prominent Chinese academics who have dared to speak out against the ruling party as Mr. Xi has tightened controls on universities. He came to wider prominence after publishing an essay in 2018 that, without naming Mr. Xi, condemned his government for stifling even the narrow space for debate that the party had previously tolerated. Now Professor Xu may join the growing list of critics of the party who have been imprisoned, unless the authorities decide that staining him with a lesser criminal charge — such as soliciting prostitution — is enough and let him go soon. The authorities have used similar charges in the past in what appeared to be attempts to discredit government critics. “The old saying from the Song dynasty goes ‘If you want to accuse someone of a crime, there’ll always be an excuse’,” Geremie R. Barmé, an Australian Sinologist in New Zealand who has translated many of Professor Xu’s essays, said by telephone. Over two years ago, Mr. Barmé said, Professor Xu mentioned the risk that “they would try and get him on soliciting prostitutes,” and he took care to avoid being set up for the crime. The Beijing police did not respond to faxed questions and phone calls about Professor Xu’s detention and whereabouts; nor did the law school at Tsinghua University, where he has long taught. In addition to Ms. Geng, the news of his detention was corroborated by two close friends in Beijing who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing worries that they would also be detained. Other friends who had tried to call him throughout the day said that he did not respond to messages and that his phone was off. Professor Xu’s detention is the latest example of the Chinese government’s expansive efforts to quash dissent. Since Mr. Xi came to power, the party has mounted an intense campaign in universities and among publishers to discredit and silence liberal ideas, such as constitutional checks on party power and an unfettered civil society. Last week, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law to tighten its control over Hong Kong, a former British colony. Professor Xu’s case could magnify fears in Hong Kong that intellectual critics of the Chinese Communist Party in the semiautonomous territory could also face arrest. In April, the Communist Party authorities confirmed that Ren Zhiqiang, a real estate tycoon in Beijing who once hobnobbed with party leaders, was under investigation after writing a bold online essay that derided Mr. Xi as a power-hungry “clown.” Xu Zhiyong, a law academic turned activist who was previously imprisoned after organizing a campaign for civic rights, was detained again earlier this year after attending a gathering of rights activists and issuing a blistering denunciation of Mr. Xi’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The two Mr. Xus are not related. “Professor Xu’s arrest this morning is yet another reminder — as if more were needed — of how easily and willingly the Chinese authorities abuse the law to target those who express views they don’t want people to read or hear,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, the head of Amnesty International’s China team. “One of the biggest concerns has to be that the police will charge him with national security charges.” Professor Xu’s recent political writings have been censored and banned in mainland China, although they circulate surreptitiously on the internet. But he has published several books in Hong Kong, including two collections of essays last year. “He avoids entirely the wooden language of Chinese officialdom,” Mr. Barmé said. “He writes using a language of profound classical resonance that also refers to some of the greatest Western writers.” Professor Xu has taught at Tsinghua University — a prestigious school in Beijing that was attended by Mr. Xi and other Communist Party leaders — for over 20 years after completing a doctorate at the University of Melbourne in Australia. For many years, he researched criminology and Chinese legal thought, without attracting the ire of the authorities. He first drew widespread attention and scorn from defenders of the party for an essay in 2018 that denounced Mr. Xi’s increasingly hard-line politics. He then unleashed a burst of essays that, using barbed, elegant Chinese, condemned and ridiculed the swelling dominance of the party under Mr. Xi. “People nationwide, including the entire bureaucratic elite, feel once more lost in uncertainty about the direction of the country and about their own personal security,” Professor Xu wrote in his essay from 2018. Tsinghua banned him from teaching and conducting research in 2019, but he kept writing despite warnings from university officials and the threat of additional punishment. This year, he issued essays blasting the Chinese government for delays and deception in the first months of the coronavirus epidemic, which began in Wuhan, a city in central China. “The coronavirus epidemic has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance,” Professor Xu wrote in February, according to a translation by Mr. Barmé. In that essay and a later one, Professor Xu said he understood the risks he faced for continuing to speak out. “I can all too easily predict that I will be subjected to new punishments,” he wrote in May. “Indeed, this may well even be the last thing I write.”']","Xu Zhangrun, who has long taught law at the prestigious Tsinghua University, is one of the few academics in China who have harshly criticized the ruling Communist Party."
‘A Colossal Error’: Mexican Leader Under Fire for Plan to Visit Trump,2020-07-07,By Natalie Kitroeff,"['MEXICO CITY — The risks could be enormous, but they haven’t swayed President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico. Mexican diplomats and opposition figures have warned Mr. López Obrador against traveling to Washington this week to thank President Trump and celebrate the beginning of a new trade deal between the two countries and Canada. The visit, they have said, was an incomprehensible choice in the middle of a pandemic and global economic crisis, coming with the risk of public humiliation at the hands of Mr. Trump, who has called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “animals” and has said that Mexico is “not our friend.” Still, Mr. López Obrador said he would move ahead with plans to fly to Washington and greet Mr. Trump on Wednesday. “President Trump’s discourse regarding Mexico has been more respectful than it was previously, for which we are very grateful,” Mr. López Obrador said in a recent news conference. “I am also going to give thanks for the U.S. government’s respectful treatment of us.” Bernardo Sepúlveda, a former foreign minister, wrote in an open letter to the government that the trip would “negatively affect national interests” in the long term, noting that Mr. Trump has been “stigmatizing, offending and humiliating Mexican immigrants.” The visit could also alienate the Democratic Party in the run up to the November elections. Mr. López Obrador does not plan to meet with Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada declined the invitation to attend the summit, citing scheduling conflicts. Some Mexican politicians and pundits view the trip as a capitulation to a leader who has routinely disparaged the country and undermined its interests. Jorge Castañeda, another former foreign minister, said the visit would not yield many benefits for Mexico and that “Trump is using López Obrador for his own political ends.” And Arturo Sarukhán, former Mexican ambassador to the United States, called the trip “a colossal error, electorally, diplomatically and strategically.” But the roasting has not deterred Mr. López Obrador, long a divisive figure in Mexican politics. He has insisted that there is more to gain from the visit than his critics will admit. “Mexico needs to have a solid relationship with the United States, no matter who is the president,” said Erick Ordoñez, 29, a supporter of Mr. López Obrador who grew up in Chiapas and now lives in Barcelona. Mr. Ordoñez said the visit could help bring more foreign investment into Mexico and lift the economy. “We need to benefit the Mexican people, with plans for trade, for creating jobs, for U.S. investment into Mexico,” he said. Mr. López Obrador has touted the importance of celebrating the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect last week, at a moment when Mexico is in dire need of an economic revival. Mr. Trump has also done Mexico a few favors of late, sending hundreds of ventilators across the border and agreeing to help the country meet an obligation to cut oil production under a recent international agreement. “It’s a big gamble,” said Luis Rubio, the president of the Mexican Council of International Affairs. “If it doesn’t go well, if Trump talks about ‘the wall’ or something in that vein, López Obrador will be embarrassed and will return with his tail between his legs.” The timing of the trip has also been the subject of scrutiny among many in Mexico. The United States is only a few months away from a national election, coronavirus infections are surging on both sides of the border and officials close to both presidents have tested positive for the virus. Adding to the trip’s health risks is Mr. López Obrador’s preferred mode of transportation: In keeping with his image as a frugal public servant, the president plans to fly to Washington on a commercial jet. “You could become infected,” said Valeria Burgos, a small-business owner in Cuernavaca, a city south of Mexico’s capital. “This is not the moment for heads of state to be leaving their countries.” But Ms. Burgos, 27, acknowledged that there might never be an ideal moment for a Mexican president to meet with Mr. Trump. During the U.S. elections in 2016, there was a similar uproar over the former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto’s decision to host Mr. Trump at Los Pinos, the Mexican White House. “That was a total disaster and an insult to Mexicans,” Ms. Burgos said. “And that was in our country. Imagine how it will be when our president goes to Trump’s country.” Mr. López Obrador won the presidency in 2018 with the largest margin of victory in more than a decade, but his popularity has slipped in recent months as concerns over his handling of the pandemic have grown. Still, the Mexican president enjoys the approval of close to 60 percent of the population and a very loyal base. “For Mexico, it’s very politically important that Andrés Manuel is close to the United States,” said José Paniagua, a longtime supporter of Mr. López Obrador who lives in Mexico City. “This is a country that always has and always will be our neighbor,” Mr. Paniagua said. “If the presidents didn’t meet it would hurt us both more, because in the end, Mexico and the United States will always be together.”']","President Andrés Manuel López Obrador will meet in the White House this week with President Trump, and he said he planned to praise the administration for its “respectful treatment” of Mexicans."
"To Buy a Drink in This Border Town, Make Sure You’re in England",2020-07-05,By Stephen Castle,"['LLANYMYNECH — In normal times, no one takes much notice of the invisible border between England and Wales that runs through Llanymynech, a village with a post office, a church and no fewer than three pubs. But the Anglo-Welsh frontier, fought over in earlier centuries, has once again become a contested front line, this time for British drinkers. England allowed restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen on Saturday, meaning two pubs in Llanymynech could serve customers again after more than 100 days of coronavirus lockdown. Less than 100 yards away, on the Welsh side of the village, the Dolphin Inn remained firmly shuttered, in line with Welsh government rules delaying pub openings until July 13 — and then allowing drinking only in gardens or other outdoor spaces. The ruling has thrust the village into the media spotlight, reminding residents of the existence of an administrative border — more like a state line than an international frontier with passport checkpoints — that scythes through their village, even cutting through one building, and then snakes away through the surrounding countryside. It has forced John Turner, landlord of the closed Dolphin Inn, to consider his future and whether he might give up the pub trade. But on Saturday it did not stop him from having a drink at the rival Bradford Arms — in England — where he struck a philosophical tone over a pint of beer. “It is ridiculous,” Mr. Turner, who is English, said of the restrictions, “but there’s got to be a border at some point, it just so happens we are on it.” This is not the first time Llanymynech’s pubs have been at the sharp end of the Anglo-Welsh divide. In the spring of 2006, Wales banned smoking indoors in bars, a measure that was not introduced in England until in the summer of 2007, drawing many smokers to the two English pubs for the interim. Down the street from the Bradford Arms lies a now defunct hotel bisected by the official Anglo-Welsh border. In a previous era, one of its two bars was closed each Sunday, when by law pubs in England could open, but those in Wales could not. The rules are different this time because the Welsh government in Cardiff has power over issues like health, education and public administration. Like Scotland, Wales has generally taken a more cautious approach to coronavirus controls than England has, for example keeping travel restrictions in place and waiting longer to open nonessential shops. Wales plans to reopen the hospitality trade more slowly, partly in light of criticism from some scientists that England is taking an unnecessary risk by opening pubs, restaurants and many other businesses at the same time — and on a Saturday, when people tend to drink more. Public health experts say that outdoor venues pose less of a risk for spreading the virus, which is why drinkers in Welsh pubs will have to gather in beer gardens or parking lots when the rules are relaxed, at least initially. All this has forced residents of the border area to think about where they live, who is making decisions and who they blame for any inconvenience. “Normally, you don’t think about the border, but it has caused headaches because Wales has made different decisions,” said Ruth Allcock, a retired fitness trainer from the nearby village of Pant, England, as she headed to the Bradford Arms with her husband for lunch. Ms. Allcock added that Welsh travel restrictions had made it harder for her to see her grandchildren who live on that side of the border. “What we thought was the U.K. doesn’t appear to be that any more,” Ms. Allcock added. Inside the pub, some were pleased to be back in the familiar spots, including Jonathan Lawley, a tree surgeon who said he had been in the pub parking lot 10 minutes early, waiting for its 11:30 a.m. opening. “If they had been opening at 6 a.m. I would have been here at 10 to six,” he said. But at the post office and village store, on the Welsh side of the village, Jennifer Bridger said she and her husband would not go out for a drink until they could complete “the triangle” — visiting all three local pubs. “We can’t have a favorite,” Ms. Bridger, adding that although the post office is less than 100 yards from the border, she had been to England only once during the lockdown. A little further into Wales, Gareth Powell, who farms around 190 acres, was planning to venture to a pub in a different English village, crossing a border that was fought over so much in previous centuries that Mr. Powell has recovered a handful of musket balls on his land. The area had Bronze Age and Roman settlements, and Mr. Powell believes that his home is built on the site of Carreghofa Castle, which was thought to have been destroyed in the 13th century. “It’s always been borderland,” said Mr. Powell, who is unimpressed with the Welsh government’s decision making. “They do things differently just to justify being there. If they did the same as the English there would be no need for them, would there?” Jason Farr, the landlord of the other pub on the English side of Llanymynech, which reopened a few hours after the Bradford Arms, agreed. Mr. Farr, owner of the Cross Keys hotel, is English but lives in Wales — “It’s cheaper over the border,” he said — and described the frontier as something that is “never even thought about.” “The only time is if there is a sporting event, England versus Wales, where you will see half the village walking around in England shirts, half the people in Welsh shirts,” he said. “But there is no animosity between each other.” Mr. Farr was only partially reopening because of the worry that people would come in large numbers from Wales. On Saturday and Sunday, he was pouring drinks for just five hours and to a maximum of 40 customers who had made reservations. “I am relieved and happy and ecstatic that we are open and welcoming customers back into the place, but we have had to put extra restrictions in on our own behalf because Wales isn’t open,” Mr. Farr said. Back at the Bradford Arms around 40 people had gathered by late afternoon, but there was no sign of a mass invasion. Mick Williams, a retired aircraft engineer, confessed to having traveled from Wales to drink, though only by walking from the other end of the village. Bob Hedley, the landlord of the Bradford Arms, said he was happy with the reopening, but having stocked up with around 140 gallons of beer, he had not yet had to call for extra supplies. Mr. Turner had long since returned to the closed Dolphin Inn, explaining that he had other plans for the evening and for the coming days, when he will be visiting his mother. “I’m not hanging around to watch all this happen next week,” he said.']","Pubs are open in England, but coronavirus restrictions have not yet eased that far in Wales. So the owner of one village bar went to a rival establishment for a pint."
Killing of Security Analyst Seen as Message to Iraqi Government,2020-07-07,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — The assassination of an outspoken Iraqi researcher who had antagonized the Islamic State as well as Iraq’s Shiite militias was seen Tuesday as a message to the Iraqi government, but it was unclear who killed him. The researcher, Hisham al-Hashimi, 47, was a prominent figure and a favorite of television news channels, which turned to him for his unvarnished takes on Iraq’s lack of security and the government’s difficulties confronting both Sunni Muslim and Shiite Muslim extremists. He was killed in front of his Baghdad home at dusk on Monday by two gunmen on motorcycles, who have not been caught or identified. No group claimed responsibility for his assassination, which shocked Iraqis and dominated the television news in Iraq on Tuesday. Young people who supported his views of the militias took to the streets in grief and anger. Security analysts pointed out that he had enemies both among the Sunni extremists in the Islamic State and in the Shiite militias, some of which are close to Iran. Mr. al-Hashimi also antagonized some politicians and government figures, especially in the previous government, by accusing them of failing to confront the militias that were shooting protesters during antigovernment demonstrations last fall. Analysts both inside and outside Iraq read his killing as a worrying sign for the government and a flagrant challenge to its declared effort to institute the rule of law. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who took office in May, has made it a priority to rein in the Shiite militias, and his government carried out a raid on one of them, Khataib Hezbollah, last month. Khataib Hezbollah is close to Iran and has been accused by the United States of conducting attacks that have killed three Western soldiers and a civilian contractor. Mr. al-Hashimi praised the raid, and has long goaded the government to stand up to the militias. Consequently, there was widespread suspicion that Khataib Hezbollah or an allied militia was responsible for his killing. However, Mr. al-Hashimi also irked the Islamic State, which has referred to him in statements as “the liar of Baghdad.” In recent weeks he told his brother that he had received a serious threat from the Islamic State, and he told friends he had been threatened by militias. Whichever group or figure ordered his killing was sending a message to the government, said security analysts and politicians. “This was all about Kadhimi,” said Michael Knights, a security analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, adding that Mr. al-Hashimi was “close to the Kadhimi circle.” Mr. al-Hashimi’s stinging critiques of the militias were not new, he said. What has changed recently was Mr. al-Kadhimi’s accession to power. Mr. al-Kadhimi said Tuesday that no one was “above the law” and that his government would hunt down the killers. He ordered an investigation headed by the deputy interior minister and said a street would be named after Mr. al-Hashimi. President Barham Salih said in a statement late Monday that “the assassination of the honest, patriotic, decent researcher Hisham al-Hashimi by outlaws is a vile crime that targets an Iraqi and his human right to live a free and decent life.” Mr. al-Hashimi was killed as he parked in front of his house in the middle-class Zaiouna neighborhood of Baghdad. One of the gunmen ran up to his car and, using a silencer, shot him at point-blank range. At least one of the four bullets entered the back of his neck. The two men escaped as neighbors and three of Mr. al-Hashimi’s four children helped pull his body from the car. He was taken to a hospital and died soon after. Mr. al-Hashimi, who was originally from Nasiriya in the south of Iraq, had been part of the opposition against Saddam Hussein and was imprisoned by him. When he was released in 2002, he turned to journalism, and when Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia emerged soon after, he started analyzing security incidents and gathering data. He had his own website and security center and had recently published papers related to the Iraqi militias. Most unnerving for longtime observers of Iraqi politics was the fact that the killing happened in the open and that the killers appeared to have easily escaped. “This is the biggest indication that there’s no state,’” said Izzat al-Shabandar, a longtime Iraqi politician, who is close to the security forces and a longtime opponent of the presence of foreign forces in Iraq. The Iranian-backed militias, the Islamic State and the American forces in Iraq, he said, were “all stronger than the state.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","The analyst, Hisham al-Hashimi, was a proponent of government efforts to rein in the Islamic State and Iraq’s Shiite militias. Suspicion fell on both groups."
Britain Says It Will Resume Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,2020-07-07,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — One day after sanctioning 20 Saudis for human rights violations, Britain on Tuesday sent a very different signal to the government in Riyadh, ending a moratorium on arm sales to Saudi Arabia over its involvement in the bloody conflict in Yemen. A court ruling last year forced the British government to suspend sales of arms and military equipment to Saudi Arabia because of the risk they would be used in violation of international humanitarian law. But after a review, Liz Truss, Britain’s international trade secretary, said on Tuesday that procedures had been revised to comply with the court’s concerns, and that the suspension of licenses for the export of arms to Saudi Arabia was at an end. Her decision prompted anger from opposition politicians and campaigners, protests that were sharpened by the timing of the announcement. On Monday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, imposed sanctions on 47 people, including 25 Russians accused of aiding and abetting in the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died after brutal treatment in detention in 2009. The British list also included two people from Myanmar and 20 Saudis accused in the assassination of the dissident Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, whose death caused outrage around the world. Mr. Raab argued that, as it charts its new course on the international stage outside the European Union — which Britain formally quit  in January — the British government was “absolutely committed to the United Kingdom being an even stronger force for good in the world.” The Saudis named in the British sanctions list included Ahmed al-Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Both men, along with 18 others, are facing trial in absentia in Turkey for directing the 15-man hit squad that flew to Turkey from Saudi Arabia to carry out the killing. While the murder of Mr. Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia’s involvement in Yemen are very different issues, critics said that imposing sanctions while also ending a moratorium on arm sales sent contradictory signals over the balance between human rights and realpolitik in Britain’s evolving foreign policy. Saudi Arabia is a big market for British arms manufacturers. Between April 2015 and March 2018, Britain’s government licensed the sale of at least 4.7 billion pounds (around $5.89 billion) of military equipment to the Saudis, and a further £860 million to its coalition partners. Emily Thornberry, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on international trade, described the resumption of arms licenses to Saudi Arabia as “morally indefensible.” The timing, she added, suggests “at the very least a case of mixed messages, undermining the government’s claim to be human rights defenders.” Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the Campaign Against Arms Trade, described the government’s move as a “disgraceful and morally bankrupt decision,” and said that further legal steps would be explored to challenge it. Under British law, the government should not grant an export license if there is a clear risk that weapons or equipment might be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law. In a written statement to Parliament, Ms. Truss acknowledged that there had been some “credible incidents of concern” related to Saudi forces’ conduct, but said that there was no systematic pattern. “The incidents which have been assessed to be possible violations of International Humanitarian Law occurred at different times, in different circumstances and for different reasons,” she wrote. “The conclusion is that these are isolated incidents.”  The British government said in a statement that all existing and new applications for arms exports to Saudi Arabia “will be assessed against the revised methodology which considers whether there is a clear risk the equipment might be used in the commission of a serious violation of International Humanitarian Law.” “The Government takes its export responsibilities seriously and assesses all export licenses in accordance with strict licensing criteria,” the statement said. “We will not issue any export licenses where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria.”  Britain is not alone in wanting to push ahead with arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Despite opposition in Congress, the U.S. State Department informally notified lawmakers in January that it intended to proceed with the sale of precision-guided missiles worth $478 million to the country.']","Military sales were suspended over concerns about Saudi human rights violations in Yemen. Now, Britain argues that Saudi violations there are “isolated incidents.”  "
Tokyo’s First Female Governor Sails to Re-Election Even as Virus Cases Rise,2020-07-05,By Motoko Rich,"['TOKYO — In rewarding Tokyo’s first female governor, Yuriko Koike, with a second term on Sunday, voters endorsed her highly visible leadership as the sprawling metropolis has avoided the kind of spiraling death toll from the coronavirus seen in other world capitals. But a recent resurgence in cases in Tokyo has made clear that her challenge is far from over. Even as Ms. Koike, 67, cruised to victory on Sunday, with exit polls by Japanese news media showing her winning 60 percent of the vote, Tokyo reported 111 new infections, its fourth straight day over 100. The creeping increase in cases has started to raise anxieties that the capital may have to reinstate elements of the nearly two-month state of emergency that it emerged from at the end of May. That growing caseload was felt in the election: About 15 percent of voters cast their ballots before Sunday, and turnout on Election Day was just above 37 percent. During the emergency period, in which the government issued voluntary requests for businesses to limit operations and residents to stay home, Ms. Koike made herself the face of Tokyo’s response to the virus. She anchored near-nightly news conferences to deliver daily test figures and advice on how to avoid infections. Ms. Koike presented a stark contrast to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who often appeared stiff in front of the news media. He was widely criticized when he posted an awkward video on Twitter showing himself at home drinking tea with his dog. Ms. Koike was a much more relaxed presence when she appeared in a jovial conversation with Japan’s most famous YouTube star, Hikakin. “Seeing her face on television every day made me feel comfortable,” Yuki Matsuura, 70, said as she voted in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo. “I think that she is doing the best that she can in a very difficult situation.” Ms. Koike said she was unlikely to request citywide business closings as she did during the earlier state of emergency. She said that she would prefer a “pinpointed” approach and that she wanted to establish a Tokyo version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 22 challengers vied for the post. Ms. Koike’s main rivals for the governor’s seat tried to differentiate themselves by staking out positions on further delaying, or even canceling, the Tokyo Olympics. Mr. Abe and the International Olympic Committee announced in March that the Games would be postponed from 2020 to 2021 because of the pandemic, and Ms. Koike has stuck to the official line. Same-sex partnerships were another dividing line in the race. All three of Ms. Koike’s most significant opponents expressed support for them: Kenji Utsunomiya, a former president of the Japan Bar Association who was backed by the country’s largest opposition parties, including the Communist Party; Taisuke Ono, a former adviser to the governor of Kumamoto in southern Japan; and Taro Yamamoto, a former actor and the head of a newly founded party. When asked about the issue during an online question session, Ms. Koike said she “didn’t know” whether she would support such a policy. The  victory on Sunday for Ms. Koike, an ultraconservative former defense minister who speaks English and Arabic, was something of a turnabout for her. Just a few years ago, she had seemed to have fallen out of favor with the public: In 2017, an upstart party she founded to challenge Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democratic Party in national elections took a drubbing, forcing her to admit “total defeat.” Until the pandemic, Ms. Koike’s record of achievements had been thin, and some of her decisions have drawn criticism. Not long after she was elected in 2016, she postponed a controversial move of Tokyo’s famous seafood market from its historic location in Tsukiji when it emerged that contaminants in the groundwater at a newly built site far exceeded environmental limits. But she went through with the move a year later even as tenants suspected that the metropolitan government had suppressed information about the safety of the new site. She also led an initiative to ban smoking in most indoor venues in Tokyo. Burnishing her credentials with hard-line conservatives, she was the first Tokyo governor to refuse during an annual ceremony to pay tribute to Koreans who died in a massacre after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. She also revoked a lease of public land to a new school for ethnic Korean residents, many descended from people who were brought to Japan as forced labor before and during World War II, when Japan occupied the Korean Peninsula. Surveys of employees of the metropolitan government, which oversees a region of 14 million people, indicate that she is far less popular among her city’s staff than she has been with voters. As an incumbent, Ms. Koike started with a considerable advantage, particularly given that the Japanese news media tends not to ask tough questions of candidates or investigate their records. The only thing that came close to a challenge to Ms. Koike were rumors that she had falsified her graduation from Cairo University in Egypt, prompting the Egyptian Embassy in Tokyo to post confirmation on its Facebook page that she had received a diploma. “The Japanese media likes scandals, but they don’t really do any serious policy review or anything that really affects our livelihood,” said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. The Japanese media “fails to inform us or fails to ask questions of the incumbents who have a huge advantage and owe us an explanation of their past record.” Ms. Koike has also managed to portray herself as a renegade. Although she started her political career as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party and served briefly as defense minister during Mr. Abe’s first term as prime minister, she has run for governor as an independent. Some analysts say she is more adept at political performance than actual policy. “She is very good at presenting catchy slogans or sound-bite phrases,” said Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor of political science at Hosei University in Tokyo. “I don’t think she has achieved substantive policies during her first term, but she often appears in television programs, especially after the outbreak of Covid-19, and she pretends to handle the problems.” Kazuhisa Tanaka, 63, who was voting in the Setagaya ward on Sunday afternoon, said he had cast his vote for the incumbent by default. “I don’t think that Koike has done the best job,” he said. “But who else would I vote for?” Hikari Hida, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']","Yuriko Koike has received high marks for her visible presence during the pandemic, but the coronavirus’s resurgence has raised anxiety in the Japanese capital."
Croatian Prime Minister’s Gamble on Early Elections Pays Off.,2020-07-05,By Joe Orovic and Patrick Kingsley,"['ZADAR, Croatia — Croatia’s ruling party finished first in a general election on Sunday despite ongoing criticism over the country’s recent handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic’s center-right party, the Croatian Democratic Union, has won more than 65 seats in Parliament. It was not enough for an outright majority, but with more than 90 percent of votes tallied, his party had at least 10 more seats than it held at the start of the campaign. Mr. Plenkovic called for early elections at the height of the pandemic in May, after his government was praised for its smooth management of the initial stages of the outbreak and his party edged ahead in opinion polls. But in the days before the vote, that decision started to look risky. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases began to spike, and polls showed Mr. Plenkovic ceding ground to his main rivals, a center-left alliance led by the Social Democratic Party.  Still, on Sunday, Mr. Plenkovic’s party emerged with one of its best showings in more than a decade. “The gamble paid off,” said Karlo Jurak, a political analyst and academic at the University of Zagreb. The strength of Mr. Plenkovic’s performance will make it easier for him to form a coalition with small centrist parties and parties representing ethnic minorities, analysts said. Mr. Plenkovic will also be less beholden to a new far-right group, the Homeland Movement, which has now entered parliament for the first time and is led by the pop singer Miroslav Skoro. Though the Homeland Movement was projected to win about 15 seats, making it the third-largest in parliament, it no longer seemed likely that Mr. Plenkovic would need its support to form a coalition. Voters opted for stability amid a profound health and economic crisis, said Dejan Jovic, a political scientist at the University of Zagreb. “It looks like the electorate sees the coming difficulties and want some center-right government to lead the country,” he said. Throughout Mr. Plenkovic’s four years in power, his government was plagued by scandal: Nine ministers left office for reasons related to corruption. But during the campaign, Mr. Plenkovic successfully diverted attention from graft by centering his re-election bid on Croatia’s strong coronavirus response, which at one point was among the strictest in the world. “Croatia and this government defeated Covid-19,” Mr. Plenkovic said at a press briefing in May. But as the campaign wore on and social restrictions eased, his strategy seemed set to backfire. In the two weeks before the election, daily coronavirus cases in Croatia rose above 50, mirroring rates at the height of the crisis in April. As cases climbed, Mr. Plenkovic’s rivals — and some of his allies — suggested that the election be postponed in the interest of public health. Attempting to ward off those concerns, the election authority briefly barred confirmed coronavirus patients from participating. But the country’s Constitutional Court later reversed the ban, allowing patients to vote by proxy. And just as support for both the center-left and far-right began to rise, Mr. Plenkovic was criticized for endorsing an exhibition tennis tournament organized in Zadar, a seaside town, by Novak Djokovic, the world’s No. 1 tennis player. The tournament was meant to stir interest in Croatia’s holiday vacation locations, boosting the country’s beleaguered tourism industry, a key part of its economy. It ended in embarrassment, for both Mr. Djokovic and Mr. Plenkovic. Crowds at the event did not have to wear masks or follow social distancing rules. Several participants contracted the virus, including Mr. Djokovic himself, forcing a premature end to the tournament and undermining Mr. Plenkovic’s victorious coronavirus narrative. Mr. Plenkovic was accused of hypocrisy after fist-bumping Mr. Djokovic and then refusing to enter quarantine, which critics felt contravened the government’s own guidelines for curbing the spread of the disease. And when Mr. Plenkovic was defended by members of the group overseeing Croatia’s virus response, the experts of the group were accused of politicizing public health. The decision created a “double standard,” said Mr. Jurak, the political analyst. But on Sunday, Mr. Plenkovic’s base nevertheless appeared to have kept faith in the prime minister and his party, Mr. Jurak said. “Plenkovic timed the vote correctly.” Joe Orovic reported from Zadar and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.']","Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic ran a risky campaign based on his government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. It paid off, with his party’s best showing in more than a decade."
Phoenix Mayor Says FEMA Refused to Help With Testing,2020-07-05,,"['This briefing has ended. Read live coronavirus updates here. Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix said on Sunday that with cases and death counts soaring in Arizona, testing sites in her city and surrounding Maricopa County are overwhelmed, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency has rebuffed her pleas for help. She raised the issue on the ABC program “This Week,” saying that it “feels like they’re declaring victory while we’re in crisis mode.” In an interview later in the day, Ms. Gallego, a Democrat, said she had been trying since April to get more testing resources for Phoenix, both from FEMA and from the private sector. But testing, she says, remains woefully inadequate, especially for those who lack health insurance. “We are the largest city not to have received this type of investment,” Ms. Gallego said, noting that FEMA had set up testing sites in Houston, Los Angeles and elsewhere. “And you can see it in the increasing rate of positives.” More than 20 percent of tests in Arizona are coming back positive now, she said. “Public health officials tell me that when you’re doing the appropriate amount of testing, it should be around 2 percent,” she said. An aide to the mayor said that FEMA had responded to the city’s most recent request by saying the agency was “getting out of the testing business.” Maricopa County officials were told the same thing when they asked FEMA for help, the mayor said. Cases have doubled in Arizona in recent weeks; more than 3,400 new cases were announced Sunday. The state marked a record on Saturday with 3,182 confirmed and suspected virus hospitalizations. “I hope they understand what it’s like out here,” Mayor Gallego said.  “I wish I could have the president with me as people fill their cars with gas so they can wait in lines for eight hours, while they’re sick and it’s 110 degrees outside,” to get a test. “This is not just a Phoenix problem,” she said. “I think many communities and people across both parties would like to see the federal government play a role.” Vice President Mike Pence, who visited Phoenix on Wednesday, said last week that testing was readily available to anyone in the country who needed it.  An administration official said the federal government is working to resolve Arizona’s need for testing supplies and that the city should work through the state to get the help it needs. “We do have one hopeful note,” Ms. Gallego said Sunday afternoon. After she raised the issue on TV, she said, “The White House reached out and said they’re interested in more information, and would try to see what they can do.”  Public health experts and officials on Sunday disputed President’s Trump’s characterization of the seriousness of the coronavirus. In an Independence Day speech on Saturday at the White House, Mr. Trump sought to dismiss widespread criticism of his administration’s slow and ineffective response to the virus. He repeated his false claim that an abundance of testing made the country’s cases look worse than they were, and he asserted that 99 percent of the nation’s cases were “totally harmless.” Cases have risen steeply in recent weeks, and infections announced across the United States last week totaled more than 330,000 — a record high that included the five highest single-day totals of the pandemic. On Sunday, more than 40,000 new cases had been announced nationally by evening. On Sunday, the former F.D.A. commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said that “certainly more than 1 percent of people get serious illness” if they are infected. Speaking on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” he estimated that when all cases were counted, including asymptomatic ones, between 2 and 5 percent of infected people become sick enough to require hospitalization. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, sidestepped repeated questions about that statement on three television news shows. “I’m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong,” he said at one point. Dr. Hahn told CNN’s Dana Bash that it’s “too early to tell” if it’s safe for Republicans to hold their convention in Jacksonville, Fla., next month. “We’ll have to see how this unfolds in Florida and elsewhere around the country,” he said. Even some Republicans pushed back at the president’s assertions. “The virus is not harmless,” Miami’s mayor, Carlos Giménez, said on “Face the Nation,” noting that positivity rates in Miami-Dade County — the share of coronavirus tests that come back positive — were now above 20 percent. Florida has reached record highs for new cases several times in the past 10 days, reporting more than 11,400 new cases on Saturday alone, according to a New York Times database. More than 10,000 new cases were announced in Florida on Sunday, and the state has now had over 200,000 total cases. Mr. Trump and other administration officials have also highlighted the country’s declining death rate. Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said improvements in care may have caused the decline, but also described deaths as a “lagging indicator.” “By the time somebody gets infected, it takes a couple weeks before they get hospitalized and get really sick, and another week or 10 days before they die, ” he said. He also said that many of the people now being infected were younger adults and less likely to develop severe illness. Studies that have calculated the death rate based on broader antibody testing that takes silent cases into consideration suggest an infection death rate of less than 1 percent, Dr. Jha said. “It’s always tricky to do this in the midst of a pandemic,” Dr. Jha said. “There are a lot of factors that go into it. But let’s say you took 1,000 Americans at random who were all infected. Our best guess is that between six and 10 would likely die of the virus.” And the death rate does not capture all of the harm caused by the disease. As many as 15 to 20 percent of known Covid-19 patients may require hospitalization, and of the group admitted, 15 to 20 percent are transferred into intensive care, according to some estimates. And many who have recovered are still struggling to regain their pre-disease lives, and may face long-term health issues.   Hospitals in Austin, Texas, could be “overrun” within two weeks if current trends hold, Mayor Steve Adler warned on Sunday. “If we don’t change the trajectory, we are within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun,” the mayor said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” He said intensive care units could fill up even sooner, perhaps within 10 days. Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, issued the same two-week warning in an appearance on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” noting that roughly one in four virus tests in the city was now positive and that the demand for testing was exceeding capacity. The virus is spreading rapidly in Texas, one of the first states to lift stay-at-home orders and reopen businesses. It has broken daily records for new cases several times in the past week. More than 195,000 cases have been identified over the course of the pandemic in the state, which hit a single-day high on Wednesday with more than 8,100 new cases. Texas broke another record over the weekend with 8,181 patients hospitalized as of Sunday. Travis County, Austin’s home, has confirmed more than 11,000 cases since the pandemic began, according to a database maintained by The New York Times. Harris County, Houston’s home, has reported 35,913. But the virus has moved beyond Texas’ generally liberal cities, reaching into the deep-red regions of the state that have resisted aggressive public health regulation. In Lubbock, more people tested positive in the last three weeks than in the previous three months combined. Two months ago, on the day that Gov. Greg Abbott began to reopen the state, the city recorded eight positive tests. On Wednesday, there were 184. Mayor Adler said that the most important thing about the order Governor Abbott signed on Thursday making masks mandatory in most counties was that people would now be getting the same guidance from both state and local officials. “It’s the messaging,” he said. “It’s the singular voice from both parties saying to our community, ‘This is important, you have to do it, it works.’” Many conservative Texans do not share that view, including some of the state’s top leaders. On Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick declared himself tired of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease doctor. “I don’t need his advice anymore,” Mr. Patrick said. That sentiment was echoed outside a popular, newly opened hamburger restaurant in Wolfforth, just outside Lubbock, where even Mr. Abbott, a Republican, came under harsh criticism. “It seems like he’s been influenced by Fauci and the left,” Mark Stewart said. But in the biggest cities in Texas, Governor Abbott’s directives don’t go far enough. “I’m sure a mask order will make some difference, and I’m grateful that that’s happened now,” Judge Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat who is effectively the chief executive of Harris County, said on the ABC program “This Week.” “That said, as long as we’re doing as little as possible and hoping for the best, we’re always going to be chasing this thing, we’re always going to be behind.” Some Texans are worried about a political event on the horizon: The executive committee of the state’s Republican Party voted on Thursday to go ahead with an in-person convention in Houston next week. In response, the Texas Medical Association said it would withdraw from the event as an advertiser. “With or without masks, an indoor gathering of thousands of people from all around the state in a city with tens of thousands of active COVID-19 cases poses a significant health risk,” the organization’s president, Dr. Diana L. Fite, said in a statement on Friday. Even Mr. Patrick said that holding an in-person convention in Houston was not a good idea, citing the risks of exposing people to Covid-19. But he added that he respected the vote of the committee. “I will be there,” he said in a statement in Friday. Early numbers had shown that Black and Latino people were being harmed by the coronavirus at higher rates, but new federal data — made available after The New York Times sued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — reveals a clearer and more complete picture: Black and Latino people have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus in a widespread manner that spans the country, throughout hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups. Latino and African-American residents of the United States have been three times as likely to become infected as their white neighbors, according to the new data, which provides detailed characteristics of 640,000 infections detected in nearly 1,000 U.S. counties. And Black and Latino people have been nearly twice as likely to die from the virus as white people, the data shows. The disparities persist across state lines and regions. They exist in rural towns on the Great Plains, in suburban counties, like Fairfax County, Va., and in many of the country’s biggest cities. “Systemic racism doesn’t just evidence itself in the criminal justice system,” said Quinton Lucas, who is the third Black mayor of Kansas City, Mo., which is in a state where 40 percent of those infected are Black or Latino even though those groups make up just 16 percent of the state’s population. “It’s something that we’re seeing taking lives in not just urban America, but rural America, and all types of parts where, frankly, people deserve an equal opportunity to live — to get health care, to get testing, to get tracing.” Global Roundup As the Iranian government battles a new wave of the virus, the authorities have, for first time since the pandemic began, ordered citizens to cover their faces in public. The new rules took effect on Sunday. A day earlier, President Hassan Rouhani urged businesses to refuse service to customers not wearing masks. And he said any government employee who showed up at work without one would be sent home and marked down as absent for the day. In Tehran, the capital, municipal officials said the police, security forces and public transportation authorities would crack down on people violating the mask rule. On Sunday, Iran marked its highest number of deaths, 163 people, from the virus in a single day since the pandemic started, according to the health ministry. Eighteen of the country’s 31 provinces are on a state of high alert for Covid-19, with nine declared as red zones, a spokeswoman for the ministry said. A doctor overseeing pandemic patients at Tehran’s designated hospital for the disease said all the beds there were full. But it remains to be seen if Iranians will adhere to the new rules. Iran briefly imposed a lockdown during its annual New Year holiday period in early April and opened the country for business in early May. Since then, the majority of Iranians have resumed ordinary life — and then some. While large gatherings such as weddings and funerals were still considered prohibited, a lavish Cinderella-themed wedding in the Lavasan hills near Tehran drew the ire of local officials. There were said to be 120 actors and 65 employees of the wedding hall re-enacting the fairy tale. The health ministry said the groom had been arrested. In other news around the world: Officials in India canceled a planned reopening of the Taj Mahal this week, dealing a setback to hopes that welcoming visitors back to monuments would boost local tourism until international flights resume. India’s coronavirus infections started to rapidly rise several weeks ago when the government began lifting a nationwide lockdown imposed in March, and some cities have already reinstated tough rules to keep their caseloads down. India has reported about 700,000 confirmed infections and nearly 20,000 deaths as of Monday. People crossing into Mexico from Lukeville, Ariz., over the weekend hit a roadblock briefly put up on the main road leading south from the border by residents fearful of the virus, The Associated Press reported. An inspection checkpoint set up near the border crossing will continue to operate to “safeguard the health of our community,” a local mayor, José Ramos Arzate, said in a statement. He noted that Arizona has an “accelerated rate of Covid-19 contagion,” and said people from the United States should be allowed in only for “essential matters.” In rewarding Tokyo’s first female governor, Yuriko Koike, with a second term on Sunday, voters appeared to be endorsing her highly visible leadership during the pandemic. The sprawling metropolis has avoided the kind of death toll seen in other big cities. But a recent resurgence in cases in Tokyo has made clear that her challenge is far from over. Even as Ms. Koike, 67, cruised to victory on Sunday, with exit polls by the Japanese news media showing her winning 60 percent of the vote, Tokyo reported 111 new infections, its fourth straight day over 100. Croatia’s ruling party came first in a general election on Sunday despite criticism over the country’s recent handling of the pandemic. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic’s center-right party, the Croatian Democratic Union, had its best showing in more than a decade.  A military plane carrying Canadian troops to Latvia as part of a NATO mission turned around midflight after the military learned that someone who might have come in contact with the passengers tested had positive for the virus. About 70 passengers and aircrew members were on board the flight Thursday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. More than six months into the pandemic, the coronavirus has infected more than 11 million people worldwide, killing more than 525,000. But despite the increasing toll, scientists still do not have a clear answer to one of the most fundamental questions about the virus: How deadly is it? A firm estimate could help governments predict how many deaths would ensue if the virus spread out of control. The figure, usually called the infection fatality rate, could tell health officials what to expect as the pandemic spreads in densely populated nations like Brazil, India and Nigeria. In poorer countries,  the number could help officials decide whether to spend more on oxygen concentrators and ventilators, or on measles shots and mosquito nets. At present, countries have very different case fatality rates, which measure deaths among patients known to have had Covid-19. In most cases, that number is highest in countries that have had the virus the longest. According to data gathered by The New York Times, China had reported 90,294 cases as of Friday and 4,634 deaths, a case fatality rate of 5 percent. The United States, which has had a record number of new daily cases six times in the past two weeks, has had 2,811,447 cases and 129,403 deaths, about 4.6 percent. Ten sizable countries, most in Western Europe, have tested bigger percentages of their populations than the United States has. Their case fatality rates vary wildly: Iceland’s is less than 1 percent, New Zealand’s and Israel’s are below 2 percent. Belgium, by comparison, is at 16 percent, and Italy and Britain are at 14 percent. Before last week, the World Health Organization had no official estimate for the infection fatality rate. Instead, it had relied on a mix of data sent in by member countries and academic groups, and on a meta-analysis done in May by scientists at the University of Wollongong and James Cook University in Australia. Those researchers looked at 267 studies in more than a dozen countries and then chose the 25 they considered the most accurate, weighting them for accuracy, and averaged the data. They concluded that the global infection fatality rate was 0.64 percent. That percentage of the world’s population equals 47 million people, including two million Americans. Other recent scientific developments: In an open letter to the W.H.O. to be published next week, 239 scientists in 32 countries are urging the agency to recognize that the virus can infect people through tiny aerosolized particles, not just larger respiratory droplets expelled by infected people in coughs and sneezes. A six-gene segment of the human genome that increases the risk of severe illness from the coronavirus was inherited from Neanderthals, according to a new study. The variant is common in Bangladesh, and may explain why Covid-19 patients of Bangladeshi descent are dying at a high rate in Britain. Only 8 percent of Europeans carry it, and it is almost completely absent in Africa. Researchers reported new evidence that a variant of the virus that has come to predominate in much of the world did so partly because it is more transmissible than other variants. The variant carries a mutation that stabilizes the virus’s spike proteins, which it uses to infect human cells. While the report notes that the findings aren’t definitive, the lead author, Bette Korber, a theoretical biologist, said, “It is the dominant virus in the world, it only took about a month for that to happen, and it’s now the one we should be looking at.” The Australian state of Victoria has locked down nine public housing towers in Melbourne, its capital, telling about 3,000 residents that they must not leave their homes for any reason for at least five days. The strict quarantine — which is the first of its kind in Australia during the pandemic and is being monitored by hundreds of police officers — started immediately on Saturday afternoon after 23 coronavirus infections were found in 12 of the towers’ households. Public health officials said everyone in the towers would be tested over the next few days. “There is a lot of intermingling of the people between those towers for work, for family, for community events,” said Dr. Paul Kelly, Australia’s acting chief medical officer. He called the towers “vertical cruise ships” with the potential to cause a major surge in cases at a time when Australia’s infections are already rising because of an outbreak across several Melbourne suburbs. Some residents of the towers objected to being quarantined without notice. Abdi Ibrahim, who lives there with his five children, including 7-month-old twins, told The Australian that the lockdown had been imposed so quickly that it gave him no time to buy groceries for his family. He also had to cancel his Sunday shift at a logistics company. “If I don’t work, I don’t get paid,” he said, adding: “We are so isolated — you know what I mean, it’s like a prison.” Officials said they would provide tower residents with food, cash compensation and rent relief. As the towers were being locked down, officials also added two more Melbourne postal codes to the 10 others already under stay-at-home orders, affecting a total of more than 300,000 people. Unlike residents of the towers, people in these areas are allowed to leave their homes for work or education, exercise, medical care, caregiving or shopping for essential supplies. Australia’s total case count remains relatively small, but public health officials have become increasingly alarmed by the outbreak in Melbourne. About 200 new cases emerged in and around the city over the past two days, a growth rate not seen since March. In rewarding Tokyo’s first female governor, Yuriko Koike, with a second term on Sunday, voters endorsed her highly visible leadership as the sprawling metropolis has avoided the kind of spiraling death toll from the coronavirus seen in other world capitals. But a recent resurgence in cases in Tokyo has made clear that her challenge is far from over. Even as Ms. Koike, 67, cruised to victory on Sunday, with exit polls by the Japanese news media showing her winning 60 percent of the vote, Tokyo reported 111 new infections, its fourth straight day over 100. The creeping increase in cases has started to raise anxieties that the capital may have to reinstate elements of the nearly two-month state of emergency that it emerged from at the end of May. That growing caseload was felt in the election on Sunday, as voter turnout dipped below 35 percent. During the emergency period, in which the government issued voluntary requests for businesses to limit operations and residents to stay home, Ms. Koike made herself the face of Tokyo’s response to the virus. She anchored near nightly news conferences to deliver daily test figures and advice on how to avoid infections. In contrast to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who often appeared stiff in front of the news media, Ms. Koike was a much more relaxed presence when she appeared in conversation with Japan’s most famous YouTube star, Hikakin. “Seeing her face on television every day made me feel comfortable,” Yuki Matsuura, 70, said as she voted in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo. “I think that she is doing the best that she can in a very difficult situation.” Some survivors of Covid-19 have a long road to recovery even after discharged from the hospital, and the illness can leave long-lasting effects that are just beginning to be recognized and understood. It is still too early to know the trajectory for these patients, but scientists are beginning research that could predict those effects, and have an impact on how doctors treat the illness. In Britain, the National Institute for Health Research, the University of Leicester and university hospitals in the city of Leicester have started a study of about 10,000 patients, which the university says makes it the largest of its kind in the world. “As we continue our fight against this global pandemic, we are learning more and more about the impact the disease can have not only on immediate health, but longer-term physical and mental health too,” Matt Hancock, the health secretary said, in a statement on Sunday. Chris Brightling, a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester and chief investigator for the study, said that “it is vitally important that we rapidly gather evidence on the longer-term consequences of contracting severe Covid-19 so we can develop and test new treatment strategies for them and other people affected by future waves of the disease.” Mr. Hancock told the BBC on Sunday that long-term effects are a “really serious problem for a minority of people who’ve had Covid, thankfully not me,” describing them as a “post-viral fatigue syndrome.” Since the dawn of cinema, Italy’s torrid summers have made outdoor movie showings under the stars a favorite entertainment choice of the season. But this year, several nonprofit cultural and social organizations have struggled to get their summer film festivals going after film distributors refused to rent them many requested titles, from the Harry Potter series to “BlacKkKlansman” to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The reason? These nonprofit organizations screen films for free, even as Italy’s fabled film industry is reeling with many theaters closed because of the virus. “The distributors told us that if we show them for free, they can’t give us films,” said Luca Sansone of the Laboratorio di Quartiere Giambellino Lorenteggio. The shows free films in a Milanese low-income neighborhood “where people don’t go to the movies because it costs too much,” he said. Those in the business say that the pandemic dealt such a blow that it put the survival of Italy’s film industry at risk, and that giving unfettered free access to films would only make matters worse. “We lost more than 30 million tickets and more than 200 million euros in takings, just in box office receipts,” said Mario Lorini, president of an association of cinema owners. Cinemas were given the green light to reopen on June 15, but only 540 have done so. New safety and social distancing guidelines limit such indoor spaces to 200 people, and many cinema owners say they cannot break even under such rules. How much more cautious is Wales than England when it comes to lockdown? Try buying a drink in Llanymynech, which straddles the English-Welsh border. For a small village, there is an impressive selection of pubs, three in all, but choose wisely if you want a pint: Only two of them — those on the English side of the border — can serve customers. “It is ridiculous,” John Turner, owner of the still-shuttered Dolhin Inn, said over a beer at a rival pub across the boundary line, “but there’s got to be a border at some point. It just so happens we are on it.” England allowed restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen on Saturday after more than 100 days of lockdown. That was good news for fully two-thirds of the pubs in Llanymynech. But the Welsh government has delayed pub openings until July 13 — and even then is allowing drinking only in gardens or other outdoor spaces. The rules are different because the Welsh government in Cardiff has power over issues like health, education and public administration. And like Scotland, Wales has generally taken a more cautious approach to virus controls than England has, keeping travel restrictions in place, for example, and waiting longer to open nonessential shops. Wales plans to reopen the hospitality trade more slowly, partly in light of criticism from some scientists that England is taking an unnecessary risk by opening pubs, restaurants and many other businesses at the same time — and on a Saturday, when people tend to drink more. An estimated 22,000 seasonal workers tend and harvest crops in New Jersey, nicknamed the Garden State for its robust agriculture industry. Many of these laborers follow the ripening crops up the Eastern Seaboard, starting in Florida, where migrant living quarters have been ravaged by the coronavirus, and working their way north to Maine. Making life even more perilous, they have been deemed essential workers — exempt from stay-at-home orders and a 14-day quarantine rule in New Jersey for people coming from states where the virus is spreading quickly. Each influx of workers brings the risk of a fresh outbreak. Barring rain, they work seven days a week. In New Jersey, 3,900 farmworkers had been tested as of Thursday and 193 were positive for the virus, according to the state’s Department of Health. Of these, 14 who had nowhere to remain isolated were placed into quarantine at a state-run field hospital at the Atlantic City Convention Center. “It’s a little dangerous,” said Felix Nieves, 56, a supervisor at Atlantic Blueberry Company in Hammonton. The 1,300-acre farm is considered the biggest blueberry producer in the Northeast. The first round of testing at Atlantic Blueberry was done early in the season, before most workers arrived. Three of the first 56 people tested were found to have the virus. Atlantic Blueberry purchased 3,000 bandannas and gave each worker two — one to wear, one to wash — and hung fire-retardant cloth between beds in the dormitories where hundreds of laborers live during the season. The farm also bought additional buses to create extra space on the shuttles that run to and from the fields. “Farming never stops,” Mr. Nieves said. “The fruit will not wait for this to pass.” Alarmed at China’s stranglehold over supplies of masks, gowns, test kits and other essential tools for tackling the coronavirus, countries around the world have set up their own factories to cope with both this pandemic and future ones. When the outbreak subsides, those factories may struggle to survive. But China has laid the groundwork to dominate the market for protective and medical supplies for years to come. Before the pandemic, China was already exporting more respirators, surgical masks, medical goggles and protective garments than the rest of the world combined, the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated. Beijing’s coronavirus response has only added to that dominance. It increased mask production nearly 12-fold in February alone. It can now make 150 tons per day of the specialized fabric used for masks, said Bob McIlvaine, who runs a research and consulting firm in Northfield, Ill. That is 15 times the output of U.S. companies even after they ramped up production this spring. “The Chinese have been successful weaving global personal protection equipment dominance with supply-chain command and control,” said Omar Allam, a former Canadian trade official trying to establish production of in-demand N95 medical respirators in his country. American companies have been reluctant to make big investments in fabric manufacturing because they worry that demand for masks will be temporary. Yet officials across the country are increasingly calling for the wearing of face coverings in public. “It is a huge mistake,” Mr. McIlvaine said, “to assume that the market will disappear.” Two hours by boat from the seaside town of Lowestoft on the east coast of England, over 100 giant windmills loom more than 500 feet above the sea. High atop the new towers, technicians in red-and-black protective suits have been working to hook them up to the British power system. Britain has been under various stages of lockdown since March. But work on this wind farm, called East Anglia One, has charged ahead. Contractors rented holiday cabins and reached agreements with hotels near Lowestoft, the operations base, so that they could house some of the offshore workers there and keep them isolated. Workers were taken out by boats to the wind farm for 12-hour day and night shifts. Producers of clean energy are pushing hard to get their projects up and running; they want to make money on their investments as soon as possible. And while the virus has reduced demand for electricity overall — the oil and gas industry in particular has been rocked by plummeting prices — renewable power tends to win out over polluting energy sources because of low costs and favorable regulatory rules. The green energy industry suffered major setbacks during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. But analysts say that businesses have consolidated since then, and the industry has continued to bring down costs. The turbines at East Anglia One are 15 times as powerful as those installed in the first offshore wind farms almost 30 years ago, and so they produce much more revenue per unit. “The outlook for renewables looks really quite resilient, despite all the Covid restrictions,” said Sam Arie, a utilities analyst at UBS, an investment bank. “We have seen a few companies with minor interruptions,” he added. “But relative to other sectors the impacts here have been very limited.” When it’s time to invite people over or arrange a play date, hosts face tough conversations with friends, neighbors and family on their standards for avoiding coronavirus infection.

South Korea Denies U.S. Request to Extradite Operator of Child Pornography Site,2020-07-06,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court on Monday rejected an extradition request by the United States for a South Korean citizen convicted of running one of the world’s biggest child pornography websites on the dark web. The South Korean, Son Jong-woo, 24, completed an 18-month sentence in April for operating a child pornography site called “Welcome to Video,” which was inaccessible by regular web browsers and for which he collected fees paid in Bitcoin from the site’s users, officials said. The United States Justice Department wanted him extradited to face money-laundering and other charges in an American court. But in a widely monitored ruling, the Seoul High Court said that keeping him in South Korea would help the country in its efforts to track down the users of his site for possible indictment. The court’s decision on Monday was a huge letdown for anti-child pornography groups in South Korea that had hoped that Mr. Son’s extradition to the United States would help deter sexual crimes in South Korea. Some of the men in the United States who received child pornography through Welcome to Video have been sentenced to five to 15 years in prison. In contrast, a lower court in South Korea gave Mr. Son only a suspended prison term. An appeals court later sent him to jail, but for only 18 months. Anti-child-pornography activists in South Korea, who have been outraged by what they see as the local judiciary’s light punishment of Mr. Son, had also called for his extradition. Mr. Son operated Welcome to Video from June 2015 until he was arrested in March 2018. Law enforcement officials around the globe have worked together to track the site’s users and have arrested hundreds of people in a dozen countries, most of them South Koreans. They also rescued at least 23 underage victims in the United States, Britain and Spain who were being actively abused by users of the site, the Justice Department said in October, when it revealed that Mr. Son had been indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia for running the site\u200b. In May, Mr. Son’s father sued his son, accusing him of concealing proceeds from his criminal activities. The move was widely seen as an attempt to open a new legal case against Mr. Son in South Korea and prevent him from being extradited to the United States. In the courtroom on Monday, Mr. Son again apologized for his crime and said he would “take whatever other punishment there is for me here in South Korea.” Public outrage against underage pornography has grown in South Korea in recent months, \u200bprompting Parliament \u200bto pass a bill calling for prison terms for the \u200bpossessors and viewers of child pornography, as well as \u200bfor \u200bits producers and distributors. South Korea has also been scandalized by the discovery of a network of clandestine online chat rooms that lure\u200bd\u200b young women with promises of high-paying jobs online and then exploited\u200b them sexually. Several men are on trial on charges of coercing dozens of women, including underage girls, into performing sex acts and sharing the \u200bfootage in pay-to-view\u200b services run through the messaging app Telegram.']",The Justice Department had sought to try Son Jong-woo after he was indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia on money-laundering and other charges.
"A Bird? A Plane? No, It’s a Google Balloon Beaming the Internet",2020-07-07,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — A fleet of high-altitude balloons started delivering internet service to Kenya on Tuesday, extending online access to tens of thousands of people in the first-ever commercial deployment of the technology. The balloons, which hover about 12 miles up in the stratosphere — well above commercial airplanes — will initially provide a 4G LTE network connection to a nearly 31,000-square-mile area across central and western Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi. Loon, a unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, launched 35 balloons in recent months in preparation for Tuesday’s start. It is collaborating with Telkom Kenya, the East African nation’s third-largest carrier. The balloons had previously been used only in emergency situations, such as in Puerto Rico in 2017 after Hurricane Maria wiped out cell towers. Loon bills the service as a cost-effective solution to the difficult challenge of bringing internet access to people in underserved remote areas. The Kenya venture is being closely watched by telecom providers in other countries as a test of whether the technology is reliable and the service can be profitable. Some technology experts have said the balloons would be better deployed elsewhere. Kenya already has far more of its citizens connected to the internet, an estimated 39 million out of 48 million people, than many other countries in the developing world. But Loon’s leaders, who inaugurated the balloon service after two years of testing, said they had chosen Kenya because of its openness to adopting new technologies. “Kenya is an ideal place for us to begin this new era of stratospheric communications,” Alastair Westgarth, Loon’s chief executive, said in an interview conducted by email. “The country has been incredibly innovative about finding new ways to connect unconnected populations. As a new, innovative technology, this is a great fit.” The balloons, made from sheets of polyethylene, are the size of tennis courts. They are powered by solar panels and controlled by software on the ground. While up in the air, they act as “floating cell towers,” transmitting internet signals to ground stations and personal devices. They last for well over 100 days in the stratosphere before being returned to earth. By allowing phone companies to expand their coverage where needed, the balloons are intended to offer countries a cheaper option than laying cables or building cell towers. This could be effective in Africa, where just over 28 percent of the continent’s 1.3 billion people were using the internet in 2019 — the lowest rate in any region worldwide — according to the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency. And even as more users have come online, internet costs remain too high for many Africans. The Kenyan authorities have said the balloons will help the country retain its competitive advantage in technological innovation. In the course of the testing that led up to Tuesday’s launch, over 35,000 users on the Telkom network connected to the internet through a Loon balloon. The users, some in remote towns in Kenya, used the service to stream video, browse websites and make video and voice calls on applications like WhatsApp. Executives with Loon would not reveal the costs of the Telkom contract or any financial arrangements. Loon, which is based in California and started operating in 2011, is one of the so-called moonshots to emerge from Alphabet’s research and development lab, known as X. Loon was spun off into a separate company in 2018 with the mandate to be a viable enterprise of its own. Other companies that have emerged from X include Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car unit. Loon delivered emergency service to over 200,000 people in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, in collaboration with AT&T and T-Mobile. In 2019, after an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 hit Peru, Loon brought LTE service to the affected area in conjunction with the telecommunications company Telefónica. Last November, the company announced that it would bring connectivity to secluded areas of the Amazon rainforest region in Peru. This year, Loon signed a deal with Vodacom to bring internet service to Mozambique. Loon is hoping to succeed in Africa where another American tech giant failed. Facebook backed efforts to beam internet connections into remote parts of the continent using drones, but abandoned the venture after several setbacks. Critics called the efforts a scheme to find new users for a platform whose reach already extends to nearly every corner of the globe. The Loon project in Kenya has also drawn criticism from some quarters. Some say that Loon and Telkom are launching the service in parts of the country where cellular networks have already been expanded, instead of targeting underserved regions like north or northeastern Kenya. Many people in poor or remote areas cannot afford phones that are compatible with the 4G service Loon provides. “I feel this solution is inordinate with the problem being solved,” said Phares Kariuki, the chief executive of Node Africa, a data management company. He noted that most Kenyans already had access to the internet — largely thanks to the proliferation of cellphone towers and fiber optic cables. “Loon is a fringe solution for places where last-mile connectivity will be too expensive because the people are sparsely populated,” Mr. Kariuki said. “It’s not the best solution for this market.” Others in Kenya welcomed the project, saying that the stratospheric balloons complement both ground and satellite technologies to help get more people online. The coronavirus pandemic also proves that connectivity is an essential service that should be strengthened more than ever, said Mark Kaigwa, founder of Nendo, a Nairobi-based technology research firm. “I think our current time of Covid-19 requires us to rethink infrastructure, essential services, movement of people, collection of data and connectivity,” Mr. Kaigwa said by telephone. Any venture that can help remove one more barrier can make a big difference, he said. “The answer to ‘Is Loon realistic?’ Well, it’s what we’ve got,” Mr. Kaigwa said. “Until we can rapidly recreate cell towers and networks,” he said, “we need an alternative like Loon.” Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif.']","A commercial deal in Kenya marks the first application of balloon-powered internet in Africa, the region with the lowest percentage of internet users globally."
Virus Revives Italy’s Age-Old Shadow Safety Net: The Pawnshop,2020-07-06,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — The economic repercussions of Italy’s lockdown to contain the coronavirus nearly wiped Anita Paris out. Her son, a car mechanic whom she depended on for financial support, couldn’t work. Her small pension didn’t suffice. The welfare checks she had hoped would pour in from the government didn’t materialize. And so Ms. Paris, a 75-year-old widow, turned to a shadow safety net that Italians have relied on for centuries, through plagues and sieges, wars and downturns. She rummaged through her home for “rings, necklaces, bracelets, everything I had around” and turned to the pawnshops that constitute an official, if anachronistic, part of the Italian banking system. “I have bills to pay,” Ms. Paris said after pawning off her things under a vaulted ceiling in the “Valuables Appraisal” hall of a baroque palace that has housed a pawnshop and the pawn departments of major banks for more than 400 years. “I have to get to the end of the month.” The economic picture for Italy, and for Italians in need of cash, does not look good. Banks, laden with debt and wary of taking on toxic loans, are unlikely to extend credit. The government’s aid packages and job security measures that have delivered billions of euros to struggling Italians are set to expire at the end of the summer, though the government is considering extending benefits. The Italian economy is estimated to contract by nearly 13 percent this year. Anxiety is palpable among Italians on pawnshop lines around the country. They worry that their short-term job contracts will run out, that customers will not fill their stores, that American tourists will not rent their rooms. But the managers of the collateral loan sector — the institutional name for pawnshops — aren’t complaining. Activity increased from 20 to 30 percent immediately after the lockdown, as clients wanted to make sure they met their interest payments but also sought new loans. And with emergency benefits about to wind down, they expect business to surge. “In the autumn, we will see more financial problems than what we have seen,” Rainer Steger, the director general of the pawnbroker conglomerate Affide, said in his Rome office, where he looked like any bank manager in a suit and tie. “Maybe we can lend a hand.” In the United States, pawnshops are associated with bulletproof glass partitions, “Guns, Gold and Cash” lawn signs and reality show spinoffs (“Hardcore Pawn”). In Italy, they have been part of the banking system for centuries. Money changers in the Lombardy region worked with collateral in the Middle Ages. The Catholic church in the 15th century sought to combat usury by pooling the resources of wealthy locals into a Mount of Piety. The idea was to create a pile of cash to make no-interest — and thus no-sin — loans to the poor, and to undercut moneylenders, often consisting of a Jewish minority who had less access to other professions. To this day, these businesses remain a niche part of large banks. “When things are going well you can buy your stuff back,” said Claudio Lorenzo, 65, a crossing guard who stopped working when schools closed and who waited outside the pawnshop of a Milan bank to pay interest on his and his wife’s wedding rings. “When things are going bad, you can’t.” In July 2018, Affide’s parent company, Dorotheum, an auction house and pawn credit service based in Vienna that is more than 300 years old, bought the pawn unit of the Italian banking giant UniCredit. In February, Dorotheum bought its largest pawnbroker competitor, Creval, and now has more than 40 branches throughout Italy. Affide is headquartered in a 16th-century palace in the Mount of Piety square in Rome, the home of pawnshops for centuries, purposefully established near the old Jewish Ghetto. Mr. Steger said big banks had turned away from their pawnshop roots at precisely the wrong time, with the economic fallout from the virus sure to generate a need for ready cash. “There’s movement,” he said as he looked at experts examining gold rings and watches through loupes in a marble hall. In an adjacent “Renewal and Disengagement” department, clients paid interest or bought back their items. Above their heads, black numbered boxes transported possessions from an upstairs vault, moving slowly along a suspended track like an upside-down train set. The baroque palace’s coffers have held Giuseppe Garibaldi’s sword, elephant tusks and precious jewels, some of which, including an 80,000-euro diamond ring, are set to go to auction this month. Bids will soon be taken on the belongings of Moira Orfei, the so-called Queen of the Italian Circus. “They are making bucketloads of money,” Giuseppe Martino, a third-generation owner of one of the many gold-buying stores that have sprouted around the palace over the centuries, said spitefully. He complained that nobody was buying his gold, just pawning possessions off. “They are hoping this virus goes on and on.” Defenders of the big pawnshops say only 5 percent of items are put up for auction, and that they are providing a vital service to working- and lower-middle-class Italians who need cash, and that their microcredit — the average loan is for less than 1,000 euros — keeps the vulnerable out of the hands of loan sharks and prevents predatory usury. They say that they offer a more straightforward, and transparent, system than many modern banking instruments, and that unlike banks that check credit lines and investigate financial history, anyone who passes a criminal record check, satisfies money laundering precautions and presents items of real value (“not a fake Rolex,” Mr. Steger said) could get access to cash. Clients deposit valuables as collateral, and then pay interest over a set period. If the client fails to pay up, the item may be put up for auction. In that case, the pawnbroker recoups its loan, and if a profit is made at the auction, it goes to the client. On a recent morning in Naples, scores of people crowded outside the pawn branch of the Bank of Naples, which is owned by the financial giant Intesa Sanpaolo.  Silvia Agora, 47, had nearly earned enough money as a hairdresser to redeem the gold bracelets her family had pawned. Then the lockdown closed her salon for three months. When it reopened in May, social distancing restrictions drastically reduced the number of customers. Now she was here to make more interest payments. “We were getting close,” she said, about reclaiming the heirlooms. “Now it’s impossible.” The Italian government pumped billions to Italian families, and made billions more in furlough payments to keep a promise that no Italian worker would be fired because of the virus. But Eleanora Fucci, 45, said she had not received those furlough payments. She used to sell bags at the Naples airport, but then the flights stopped coming. The store closed in March, tourism crashed and plans to reopen look doubtful. She said her savings were nearly used up. The mother of two said that her friends had started taking in laundry or ironing and that she was considering doing it also. “One way or another,” she said. “You have to find a way to make things work.” Francesco Nardelli, 43, who works as an orderly in a nursing home on short-term contracts, emerged from the bank, where he paid interest on his mother’s gold bracelets. He said his most recent contract had expired in March. He was put on a new month-to-month contract, which reduced his pay by half — a starting position, despite his previous experience. “I had to start all over again,” he said, his wife and son by his side. “There is no security.” The gold and jewelry-backed loans business of Gruppo Intesa Sanpaolo is in the process of being acquired by Banca Sistema, where a spokeswoman said new pawnbroker policies increased by 20 percent in March and April. Much of the increase has been in the Italian north, where the virus hit hardest. Outside UBI Bank in Milan, a furloughed cook, the owner of a ballet-costume company and dozens of others waited their turn on a recent day.  Katia Marchesi, 57, stood in line to make an interest payment on the gold chains and medals she and her daughter had received for their christenings and communions. Ms. Marchesi said that she lost her cleaning job, but because it was off the books, she didn’t apply for government support. She was willing to pawn more valuables. “But,” she added, “I don’t have anything else.” Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Milan.']","Italians have put up valuables as collateral for loans for centuries, through plagues and sieges. Today they do it as part of the formal banking system. And business is booming."
President Bolsonaro of Brazil Tests Positive for Coronavirus,2020-07-07,"By Ernesto Londoño, Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who has railed against social distancing measures and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus as the epidemic in his country became the second-worst in the world, said Tuesday that he, too, had been infected. Critics at home and abroad have called Mr. Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic cavalier and reckless, allowing the virus to surge across Brazil, Latin America’s largest nation. At one point he dismissed it as “a measly cold,” and when asked in late April about the rising death toll, he replied: “So what? Sorry, but what do you want me to do?” As the caseload has skyrocketed, Mr. Bolsonaro has shunned masks, attended mass rallies of his supporters, insisted that the virus poses no threat to healthy people, championed unproven remedies and shuffled through health ministers who disagreed with him.  Brazil now has more than 1.6 million confirmed cases and more than 65,000 deaths — more than any country except the United States. Mr. Bolsonaro fell ill two days after he and a handful of his ministers attended a Fourth of July luncheon at the residence of Todd Chapman, the American ambassador in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro and other attendees sat shoulder-to-shoulder, embracing with no masks. The ambassador and his wife have since tested negative for the virus, but will remain at home, in quarantine, the embassy said. Speaking to journalists outside the presidential palace in Brasília shortly after noon on Tuesday, Mr. Bolsonaro, said he had taken a test on Monday after experiencing fatigue, muscle pain and a fever. He said he was feeling “very well,” which he credited to having taken hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug he has endorsed but which studies show does not ward off the virus. Covid-19 cases that become serious often take a turn for the worse about a week after symptoms emerge. Mr. Bolsonaro did not express contrition for his handling of the pandemic, and doubled down on his assertion that the virus poses little risk to healthy people.  He characterized the diagnosis as a predictable outcome of a leadership style that requires him to be among the people.  “I am the president, I have to be on the front lines of the fight,” he said, comparing the virus to “rain, which is going to get to you.” After taking questions from journalists, Mr. Bolsonaro stepped back a few feet, removed the mask he had been wearing and smiled.  “Thank you to all those who prayed for me and rooted for me,” he said. “I’m fine, thank God. Those who have criticized me, that’s fine, they can continue to criticize me.” Even as several of Mr. Bolsonaro’s aides have tested positive for the virus in recent months, the president has often eschewed precautions, boasting of how his athletic background would protect him and encouraging his supporters to flout lockdown measures imposed by city and state officials.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain also rebuffed social distancing advice and resisted lockdown measures, though he was never as dismissive as Mr. Bolsonaro. But after he became seriously ill with Covid and spent several days in a hospital, he appeared to take the danger more seriously, and made a point of praising overburdened health care workers. Mr. Bolsonaro’s management of the virus has deeply divided his country, with many opponents expressing their rage at his heedless approach by banging pots and pans at their windows in the evenings. As Brazilians awaited the results of the president’s latest coronavirus test, messages posted on social media illustrated how politically polarized the country had become.  Two trending hashtags on Twitter Tuesday morning were #ForçaBolsonaro and #ForçaCorona — the first sending the president strength and the other effectively expressing hope that the president would fall ill. When she heard the news, Day Medeiros, a 31-year-old community activist in Santa Cruz, a working-class neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, said she was immediately worried about how Bolsonaro supporters there would receive it. Hers is one of the neighborhoods with the highest contingent of Bolsonaro voters in the city. “My concern is that he will use this to say, ‘See, I’m fine, if you catch this you will survive,’” she said. “Everything that happens to him has real repercussions in how people behave here. This is really serious.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s diagnosis is the latest challenge for a government that has been rocked in recent months by abrupt cabinet departures and a series of legislative and criminal investigations targeting the president and his relatives. As the country’s coronavirus caseload ballooned, Mr. Bolsonaro fired his first health minister in April over disagreements about the response to the virus, and drove his second one to quit less than a month into the job. Since mid-May, an active-duty army general with no experience in health care has headed the ministry, which has been faulted for failing to mount a robust testing and contact tracing strategy. As the health crisis worsened, Mr. Bolsonaro sparred with governors and mayors who imposed loosely-enforced lockdowns and quarantines. Claiming that local officials were presenting an unduly grim picture of the pandemic, Mr. Bolsonaro in June called on supporters to break into hospitals and film what they saw. The president’s illness will do little to alter Brazil’s approach unless he experiences serious complications, politicians and public experts predicted. The country is now in the process of reopening, with Brazilians packing bars, beaches and public spaces. A mild case could leave Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters feeling vindicated, and accelerate the reopening of businesses in Brazil that began in recent weeks, when bars and gyms started welcoming patrons again. “I don’t think we’ll see any significant changes,” Senator Alessandro Vieira, an opposition lawmaker. “Their denial is absolute, a bizarre thing.” Supporters of the president praised him for disclosing his condition promptly and predicted he would recover quickly by taking the anti-malaria drug. “I’m praying for his recovery,” Sóstenes Cavalcante, a congressman from Rio de Janeiro wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations to the president for being transparent with the Brazilian people. We are all at risk of contracting the virus and our opinion on SOCIAL DISTANCING will not change at all.” If the president is among the majority of Covid-19 patients who do not become gravely ill, he will be widely seen as living proof of the merits of hydroxychloroquine, said Denise Garrett, a Brazilian-American epidemiologist. Despite the lack of evidence that the drug helps, and its potentially dangerous side effects, many Brazilians believe in the drug, said Dr. Garrett, who formerly worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fernando Haddad, the leftist politician Mr. Bolsonaro defeated in the 2018 presidential race, faulted the president’s handling of the crisis for the disease’s spread in Brazil. “I regret that more than 1.6 million people have been infected and the fact that we’ve had the world’s worst response,” he wrote on Twitter. “I hope they all recover, including Mr. Bolsonaro. To relatives of those who have left us due to the government’s neglect, my sincere condolences.” The president said on Tuesday that his illness did not alter his view that Brazilians needed to continue working. A bigger threat than the virus, he said, was failure to get workers back on the job in an economy that is expected to contract by up to 10 percent this year. “There is no need to panic,” he said. “Life goes on.”']","After months of denying the seriousness of the pandemic and brushing aside protective measures, Mr. Bolsonaro felt symptoms of Covid-19.

"Years After 43 Mexican Students Vanished, a Victim’s Remains Are Found",2020-07-07,"By Kirk Semple, Paulina Villegas and Natalie Kitroeff","['MEXICO CITY — Nearly six years after 43 college students disappeared in rural Mexico, the government announced the first major breakthrough in its investigation on Tuesday: Forensic scientists have identified the remains of one of the students. Bone fragments found near where the students disappeared have been tested by Institute of Genetics at the University of Innsbruck, in Austria, and identified as the remains of Christian Alfonso Rodríguez Telumbre, one of the students, said Omar Gómez Trejo, the special prosecutor assigned to the case. He added that forensic experts from Argentina had confirmed the findings. The discovery marked a fresh sign of progress toward solving a case that traumatized Mexico and became a symbol of rampant corruption in the country’s justice system. It has long been assumed that the missing students were killed, and various people in authority have been implicated, but no one has been put on trial and the motive remains a mystery. “We have broken the pact of impunity and silence that surrounded” the case, Mr. Trejo said at a news conference. He added, “today we tell the families and society that the right to the truth will prevail.” The discovery was a victory for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who had promised to prioritize the investigations — and who desperately needs a political boost amid a plummeting economy, soaring crime and a coronavirus pandemic that continues to worsen in Mexico. The announcement came on the eve of Mr. López Obrador’s visit with President Trump in Washington — a trip for which the Mexican president was roundly criticized at home, because of the American president’s harsh language about Mexico and Mexicans. For the missing students’ relatives, who for years have demanded a more robust government investigation into their loved ones’ whereabouts, the identification represented a long-awaited step toward closure. Mr. Telumbre is only the second to be found, and the first since December, 2014, when a bone fragment was identified as belonging to another missing student, Alexander Mora. “For Christian’s family this is devastating news, and for the rest of the families it is the materialization of their worst fears that this might have been all of the students’ destiny,” said Santiago Aguirre, director of Centro Prodh, a human rights organization that represents the families. They expect it to be “the beginning of a new and serious investigation that once and for all clarifies what happened to every single one of the students,” he said. The students were undergraduates at a teachers’ college in the town of Ayotzinapa in the southern state of Guerrero. The night they disappeared — Sept. 26, 2014 — they were in the process of commandeering buses to carry their peers to a demonstration in Mexico City, a time-honored tradition among students at their college and one that was mostly tolerated by the bus companies. But their escapade quickly devolved into a long, harrowing and chaotic night of terror and violence that involved law-enforcement and other gunmen, according to two reports released by an international panel of investigators several years ago. By daybreak, six people were dead in the city of Iguala, dozens were wounded and the 43 students had vanished. Even in a country often wracked by violence, the incident horrified people and spurred huge, nationwide protests demanding that the government solve the mystery and end corruption and impunity. In 2015, after months of investigation, the administration of then-President Enrique Peña Nieto concluded that the students had been kidnapped by police officers working on behalf of a criminal group, which in turn killed them, burned their bodies in a trash dump and disposed of their ashes in a river. But the panel of international investigators, experts in forensics and human rights who examined the case for a year at the invitation of the Mexican government, thoroughly discredited the government’s findings. The panel said the authorities had tried to thwart its work, questioning the integrity of the Mexican criminal justice system and the government’s commitment to finding the truth. They determined that suspects had given testimony under torture or under otherwise “cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.” The experts also questioned the Mexican authorities’ handling of evidence and their failure to pursue certain promising lines of inquiry. It later emerged that the experts, in addition to suffering a campaign of harassment and interference, had been targeted by spyware purchased by the Mexican government. Mr. Aguirre, the lawyer representing the families, said on Tuesday that an anonymous call led investigators to a specific spot in Cocula, a town near Iguala, where the remains were found — about half a mile from the garbage dump. More remains are likely to be found in that location, he said. The new discovery “breaks away from the narrative of a lie” by the former government that was meant to foreclose further investigation, said Mr. Trejo, the special prosecutor. After taking office in July 2018, Mr. López Obrador quickly began to make good on his campaign promise to redress his predecessor’s mishandling of the case. His first official decree, signed two days after his inauguration, established a special presidential commission to support the families of the victims and get to the bottom of the case. He has since invited the international panel of experts to return to assist with the investigation, and the country’s independent attorney general has created a special investigative unit dedicated to solving the case. In the past year, investigators have combed numerous sites looking for evidence, and have sought the arrests of more than 50 people in connection with the case. Many are former government officials who were involved in the investigation during Mr. Peña Nieto’s term; some have been accused of torture, forced disappearance and obstruction of justice. Among the suspects is Tomás Zerón, who had been the chief of criminal investigations in the attorney general’s office during Mr. Peña Nieto’s term and was investigated for his handling of witnesses and evidence. Officials say Mr. Zerón fled the country months ago prompting an Interpol notice for his arrest.']",The identification of one victim’s remains is the first sign of progress in years in a case that traumatized Mexico and became a symbol of corruption and injustice.
Uighur Exiles Push for Court Case Accusing China of Genocide,2020-07-06,By Marlise Simons,"['Uighur exiles urged the International Criminal Court on Monday to investigate Beijing for genocide and crimes against humanity, the first-ever attempt to use international law to hold China’s ruling Communist Party accountable for its draconian crackdown on the Muslim minority. A team of London-based lawyers representing two Uighur activist groups has filed a complaint against Beijing for pursuing the repatriation of thousands of Uighurs through unlawful arrests in or deportation from Cambodia and Tajikistan. The case could bring greater international scrutiny of the Chinese state’s power to impose its will beyond its borders. The lawyers’ 80-page filing includes a list of more than 30 Chinese officials they said were responsible for the campaign, including Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader. Mr. Xi’s policies over recent years have put Muslim minorities in China’s western region of Xinjiang under a pervasive net of surveillance, detention and social re-engineering. As many as one million ethnic Uighurs and members of other Muslim minorities have been held in internment camps in the region, drawing growing global condemnation. The court’s mandate is to seek justice for victims of genocide, war crimes and other atrocities. But China does not recognize its jurisdiction, raising the question of how far the case will go. Rodney Dixon, a British lawyer leading the case, said it circumvented the issue of jurisdiction over Beijing by focusing on claims of unlawful acts by China in Cambodia and Tajikistan, two countries that are members of the court. “This can become a critical case because for so long it has been assumed that nothing could be done to hold China accountable at an international court,” Mr. Dixon said by telephone from London before traveling to The Hague. Citing a 2018 ruling by the court, Mr. Dixon said, “The court has said it has jurisdiction when crimes start or end in a member state, and that is the case here.” The 2018 ruling was applied to Myanmar, which has also not signed on to the court’s treaty. The court ruled that it could prosecute Myanmar for “deportation” and associated crimes against Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh, which is a member. The two Uighur groups that filed the complaint against China are the East Turkistan Government in Exile and the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement. The groups advocate independence for Xinjiang, a region they refer to not by its official Chinese name but as East Turkestan, the name of two short-lived Uighur republics. Their complaint also broadly takes aim at China’s policies in Xinjiang over the past decade and the imposition of increasingly harsh security measures following a spate of violent unrest. The Uighurs have long resented the tight controls imposed by the authorities on their religion and culture and the influx of Han Chinese, the majority ethnic group in China, into Xinjiang. Under Mr. Xi, the Xinjiang government expanded efforts to cajole, pressure or force Uighurs to return from abroad, and also established the internment camps intended to indoctrinate Uighurs to turn away from religion and embrace Chinese rule. It has imposed programs pushing minorities into jobs as factory workers and street cleaners. The authorities are also pursuing an expansive and troubling campaign to drastically reduce the birthrate among minority groups in Xinjiang using forced sterilization and abortions, according to an investigation by The Associated Press and Adrian Zenz, a German researcher. Mr. Dixon, the British lawyer, said the complaint against Beijing included evidence of forced deportations and extraterritorial arrests by Chinese agents, gathered from witnesses and victims, reports from the United Nations and organizations such as Amnesty International and exile groups. “The prosecutor needs to investigate genocide,” Mr. Dixon said. “If you capture people, and you have a campaign to suppress them and you sterilize them, it is a campaign which intends to dilute and destroy their identity as a group.” It may take months before the international court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda of Gambia, issues a formal response to the lawyers’ filing. China’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment on the complaint. But the Chinese government has repeatedly rejected the evidence of widespread repression of minorities in Xinjiang. “Xinjiang fully implements the policy of freedom of religious belief,” the ministry said last week in a long rebuttal to recent criticism of China’s human rights record. “Xinjiang has never curtailed the freedom of travel of Uighur people or people of any other ethnic groups.” China’s response to the filing may mirror that of the Trump administration in cases that have involved Americans. The administration has fiercely attacked the international court for initiating an investigation of possible war crimes by American and Afghan forces in Afghanistan. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described it as “a kangaroo court,” and President Trump called for economic penalties and travel restrictions to be imposed on court employees participating in investigations of Americans.

Bolsonaro Takes New Coronavirus Test After Attending Lunch Without Mask,2020-07-07,"By Ernesto Londoño, Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said Monday night that he went to the hospital for a lung scan and would take a new test for the novel coronavirus. He took those steps after developing symptoms of the virus, including a fever, according to a report in Portuguese from CNN Brasil. Even as several of Mr. Bolsonaro’s aides have tested positive for the virus in recent months, the president has often eschewed precautions such as mask wearing and social distancing. Most recently, he attended a luncheon on Saturday hosted by the American ambassador in Brazil to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday. A photo taken during the lunch and posted on Twitter by Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo shows the president sitting next to the United States Ambassador to Brazil, Todd Chapman, giving a thumbs-up sign at a table decorated for the holiday. Neither was wearing a mask. Late Monday, the president’s office said Mr. Bolsonaro’s test results were expected on Tuesday. “The president, at this time, is in good health and remains at his residence,” the statement said. Also on Monday night, the U.S. embassy signaled concern that the ambassador might have been exposed to the virus, saying that Mr. Chapman does not have any symptoms but intends to get tested and “is taking the proper precautions,” including following contact tracing protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control. “Our two governments have continuous communication, including on this matter,” the embassy statement said. “We wish President Bolsonaro a prompt recovery.” While he awaits the test results, Mr. Bolsonaro cleared his schedule on Tuesday, according to several Brazilian press reports. When he returned to the presidential palace on Monday evening, Mr. Bolsonaro told a group of supporters that his lung scan looked “clean” and that “everything was OK.” CNN reported that Mr. Bolsonaro, 65, had a fever above 100 degrees and had begun taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria pill he has promoted as effective to treat the virus. The report attributed that information to the president himself. Mr. Bolsonaro has come under criticism for his cavalier handling of the pandemic, even as Brazil’s caseload and death toll ballooned in recent months. Brazil’s more than 1.6 million cases and more than 65,000 deaths make it the second hardest-hit country by the pandemic, trailing only the United States. Even so, Mr. Bolsonaro has called the quarantines imposed by Brazilian states unjustifiably damaging to the economy. And he has often ventured out in public without wearing a mask, in violation of a mandatory rule in the capital. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: A federal judge last month issued an order calling on the president to wear a mask in public. Since then, the president has more consistently worn a mask when he is outdoors. Several cabinet members joined Mr. Bolsonaro at the Fourth of July celebration at the American ambassador’s residence. Traditionally, the embassy has thrown a large party to mark the American holiday. Instead, this year, Mr. Chapman hosted the president and a small delegation. The embassy did not immediately respond to questions about what precautions, if any, were taken to protect attendees at the luncheon. Several senior officials in the Bolsonaro administration tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from a trip to Florida in early March, where Mr. Bolsonaro dined with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Since then, Mr. Bolsonaro has taken several coronavirus tests, and asserted that all came back negative. Still, he has suggested that contracting the virus would not pose a serious threat because he has “an athlete’s background.”']",President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said he would take another test for the coronavirus after a news report indicated he had developed symptoms of Covid-19.
London Police to Review Handcuffing Procedures After Detention of Black Athletes,2020-07-08,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The head of the London Metropolitan Police said on Wednesday that the force’s handcuffing practices would be reviewed, after officers on Saturday pulled a top British sprinter and her partner from their car and handcuffed them in front of their 3-month-old son. The athlete, Bianca Williams, 26, a European and Commonwealth games gold medalist, and her partner, Ricardo dos Santos, 25, a Portuguese track star, were driving home from training on Saturday afternoon in Maida Vale, a well-off neighborhood in West London, when they were stopped by the police. They were handcuffed for 45 minutes on the side of the road while the police searched the vehicle. The London Metropolitan Police said in a statement that the vehicle was stopped because it was “being driven in a manner that raised suspicion,” but Ms. Williams accused the officers of racial profiling. She said that she and Mr. dos Santos were pulled over only because they were Black and driving an expensive Mercedes in a wealthy section of the city. The police have apologized to Ms. Williams and Mr. dos Santos for causing distress but have denied wrongdoing, despite criticism that the encounter was the latest example of “stop and search” tactics disproportionately targeting Black people in Britain. Commissioner Cressida Dick of the Metropolitan Police acknowledged on Wednesday that the encounter “raised lots of concerns for people.” Ms. Dick told lawmakers that although there had been no apparent misconduct by the police, two of her officers had visited Ms. Williams on Tuesday to apologize. “I think all of us watching could empathize with somebody who is stopped in a vehicle, who has a young child in the back, who does not probably know what exactly is going on, and is subsequently found, together with her partner, not to be carrying anything illicit,” Ms. Dick said at a hearing of the Home Affairs Committee, in which she addressed questions about policing in the midst of a pandemic and street protests. Ms. Dick said her forces had been “through a turbulent few weeks,” as officers have been attacked by far-right protesters in June and injured when they tried to disperse crowds attending illegal outdoor gatherings. She told lawmakers that the incident would be reviewed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, a public body in charge of complaints made against police forces. “My senior officer has said, ‘I’m sorry’ to Ms. Williams for the distress it caused her, and I say that too,” Ms. Dick said, vowing to review handcuffing procedures. “I don’t want, and I don’t believe I do, run a police service in which handcuffing is routine.” While the use of “stop and search” tactics has dropped sharply from a peak in 2009, there has been a spike in their use during the coronavirus lockdown. It has coincided with the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement globally, which has focused public attention on police tactics following the death of George Floyd while in police custody in the United States. Black people in England and Wales are nearly 10 times as likely to be stopped and searched than white people are, according to official statistics, which do not include vehicle searches. Many in Britain viewed the encounter involving officers and the star athletes on Saturday as part of a broader pattern. In videos showing parts of the incident, a female police officer can be seen asking a woman sitting in the back of a car to step outside, while the woman pleads that she does not want to be separated from her baby. Ms. Williams later told the BBC that she had felt hurt and scared, and that she had never faced such an encounter, but that her partner, Mr. dos Santos, was used to them. “I would say it’s my normal,” Mr. dos Santos said. “It’s horrible to say.”']",The London police commissioner apologized to the track star Bianca Williams and her partner after they were handcuffed during a traffic stop on Saturday.
"In a Death, Details of More Russian Murder-for-Hire Plots",2020-07-09,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Earlier this year, a heavyset man living in Vienna and known as Martin Beck said during a TV interview that he was assisting an investigation of a complicated murder-for-hire plot, in which three people were to be killed in exchange for $2 million. He described a blood-splattered world of contract killings for revenge and politics, of a type that seems to exist only in moviemakers’ fantasies — and in Russia. Now, associates of Mr. Beck say his murder over the weekend, which he claimed to know was coming and carried a $5 million reward, lends credence to his account of operating as an informant on a group of assassins from the Russian region of Chechnya. Ihor Mosiychuk, a former member of Ukraine’s Parliament and one of the three targets of the plot Mr. Beck described, said in an interview that he had met with Mr. Beck and found him credible. “The materials that he gave to me and the police fully conformed with the events that occurred,” he said. In the fateful interview, Mr. Beck said he had for years been cooperating with the Ukrainian and Austrian secret services to inform on officials in the Chechen regional government who he said ordered contract murders in Europe and Ukraine. The interview was posted online in February by the Ukrainian television station Svobodny. Born Mamikhan Umarov in Chechnya and known by a variety of aliases, Mr. Beck told the station that he had fought against Russia in the post-Soviet wars in Chechnya and received a new identity as an asylum seeker in Austria more than a decade ago. Ukraine’s national police and the country’s domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., declined to comment on the killing of Mr. Beck, as did the authorities in Austria, who have said they arrested two ethnic Chechens in connection with the shooting on July 4 outside Vienna. In a statement posted online Thursday, the iron-fisted and Kremlin-allied Chechen leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, denied any role in the killing and blamed unspecified Western security services. “The sellout mouthpieces receive money for their work and are then killed as supposedly innocent victims,” he wrote. Organized-crime style contract murders were rampant in Russia’s business circles in the early post-Soviet period. In recent years, however, the rising incidence of contract killings by Russians outside the country is raising alarms. American intelligence agencies are investigating whether Russia has paid bounties to the Taliban or criminal groups for attacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan. Speaking anonymously, intelligence officials have said $500,000 in cash was found at the house in Kabul of a possible intermediary, who was thought to have fled to Russia to avoid arrest. In 2006, Russia legalized the targeted killing of “terrorist” suspects abroad under authorizations that Russian officials like to compare to the legal justifications for American drone strikes. Russia has never publicly acknowledged using the authority granted under the law. While Ukrainian officials have for years accused Russia of conducting strikes against military officers and members of paramilitary groups active in the war in eastern Ukraine, there is no direct evidence tying the Kremlin to these schemes. In his February interview, Mr. Beck identified the three targets of the plot as a commander, a deputy commander and a sniper in Ukrainian paramilitary groups fighting Russian-backed rebels. Two of them were Chechens, and therefore considered turncoats, and the third, Mr. Mosiychuk, had insulted the Chechen leader, Mr. Kadyrov, in a video posted online. Mr. Beck said he learned of the affair because an official of the Chechen regional government, unaware that Mr. Beck was an informant, had asked him to act as a middleman in arranging the killings, and that he had recorded the conversations. Svobodny published several of the recordings, in which there is some haggling over the price. At one point, a man speaking in Chechen with Mr. Beck says of the three targets in Ukraine, “If they get worked over, it would be very good.” Elements of the story are unclear, including why the intended victims were not warned in advance. But one thing is certain: All three people were targeted. Under the guise of a foreign correspondent for the French newspaper Le Monde, one assassin, identified as Artur Denisultanov-Kurmakayev, arranged to interview two of them: the commander of the Dzhokhar Dudayev paramilitary group, Adam Osmayev, and his wife, Amina Okuyeva, who was a sniper. In that attempt in Kyiv in June 2017, Mr. Osmayev was wounded before Ms. Okuyeva shot and wounded the fake journalist. Mr. Denisultanov-Kurmakayev was detained but traded to Russia last year by President Volodymyr Zelensky for captured Ukrainian spies. Mr. Denisultanov-Kurmakayev had also asked for an interview with Mr. Mosiychuk, who was deputy commander of the nationalist Azov paramilitary group as well as a Member of Parliament. But he had brushed off the request by suggesting the reporter speak to his press secretary instead. That October, the attacks resumed. An assailant with a machine gun hiding in the bushes near a railway crossing outside of Kyiv sprayed the car of Mr. Osmayev and Ms. Okuyeva, killing Ms. Okuyeva. Also that month, a remote-controlled bomb attached to a parked motorcycle on a Kyiv street exploded near Mr. Mosiychuk, wounding him and killing a bodyguard and a bystander. In the TV interview, Mr. Beck said he had helped the Ukrainian authorities identify a courier delivering payments from Chechnya to Europe for contract murders, a lead that could shed light on a string of murders in the Chechen diaspora in Europe. Last August, an assassin riding a bicycle and armed with a silenced pistol shot and killed a former rebel commander, Zelimkhan Khangushvili, in the Kleiner Tiergarten park in Berlin. Police arrested the killer after he threw his gun and a wig in a river. German officials said they suspected Russia was behind the killing, which Moscow denied, and expelled two Russian diplomats in retaliation. In January, a Chechen exile and critic of Mr. Kadyrov, Imran Aliyev, was stabbed 130 times and died in his hotel room in Lille, France. Prosecutors say a suspect escaped to Russia. A few weeks later, a Chechen blogger, Tumso Abdurakhmanov, who is critical of Mr. Kadyrov, said he had fought off and subdued an assailant with a hammer who had sneaked into his home in Gavle, Sweden. Mr. Abdurakhmanov made and posted a video showing him questioning the man immediately after the fight, demanding to know who had sent him. The man and a woman, both Russian, were arrested in connection with the attack. Why Mr. Beck decided to go public with his tale, when the consequences seemed so lethal, is not entirely clear. Mr. Mosiychuk said Mr. Beck was motivated by a blood feud with the Chechen leader, Mr. Kadyrov, whom he blamed for the death of his brother. “All Chechens who went through the war live in a terrifying world,” he said. “It’s a complicated situation.” Mr. Beck said in the interview that his relations with Ukraine’s police were fraying, suggesting he could no longer count on their support. It is also conceivable that, if Mr. Beck knew he was being stalked, as he claimed, he might have thought that the glare of publicity was his best defense. Asked if the price on his own life seemed high or reasonable, Mr. Mosiychuk said it seemed high but, “How should I know? I don’t order killings.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.']",A Chechen man shot near Vienna last weekend had spoken publicly of giving Austrian and Ukrainian authorities information about contract killings. He also said there was a price on his head.
"Thailand Moves to Legalize Same-Sex Unions, a Rare Step in Asia",2020-07-09,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — In a country that has long been a rare bastion in Asia for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, Thailand said on Wednesday that it had approved a draft bill that would give same-sex unions many of the same benefits as those of heterosexual marriages. The bill, approved by the cabinet, avoids the term “marriage” but allows for the legal registration of same-sex partnerships. Accompanying amendments to the civil code would give couples the right to jointly own property, adopt children and pass on inheritances. Civil partnerships must occur between individuals who are at least 17 years old. At least one of the pair must be a Thai citizen. “The Civil Partnership Bill is a milestone for Thai society in promoting equality among people of all genders,” said Ratchada Dhnadirek, a deputy government spokeswoman. “This strengthens the families of people with sexual diversity and is appropriate for the present social circumstances.” While the bill still needs to be passed by Parliament to become law, social activists say that the biggest hurdle was approval by Thailand’s cabinet, which is a stronghold of retired military generals and tradition-bound political elders. Although some elements of the Buddhist-dominated culture in Thailand are socially conservative, the country is also one of the most open places in the world for L.G.B.T.Q. people. Thai surgeons have been pioneers in gender-reassignment surgery, and schools in rural Thailand have provided separate bathrooms for transgender students. Hit soap operas chronicle gay relationships. And four transgender people were elected to Parliament last year. Yet discrimination persists, with gay and transgender individuals often encouraged to enter certain fields like entertainment or fashion. Rights activists say that the welcoming attitude toward gay tourists may not be as pervasive toward Thais themselves. If the civil partnership bill is approved by Parliament, Thailand will join Taiwan as the only places in Asia that provide elements of legal equality for same-sex couples. Taiwan’s legislature passed a same-sex marriage law last year. The Thai bill is not as expansive as that of Taiwan. Same-sex couples in Thailand will not be able to enjoy certain tax breaks. And critics of the bill say that calling such unions civil partnerships, rather than marriage, is a cop out. “The foundation of the same-sex union law draft isn’t based on equality,” said Pauline Ngarmpring, who is transgender and who ran for prime minister last year. “But it’s better than nothing,” she added. “This is not a fight that can be finished in our generation.” Ms. Pauline, a former sports promoter, noted that she was still identified as male on her Thai identity card and must use male facilities at public hospitals. In Malaysia, Singapore and other Asian nations, gay sex is a criminal offense. Brunei last year enacted laws calling for death by stoning for gay sex and adultery, but after an international outcry, the nation’s sultan said that capital punishment had not been carried out for decades and that the moratorium on the death penalty would continue. This year, a judge in Singapore rejected efforts to overturn rarely enforced colonial-era legislation that could lead to up to two years’ imprisonment for consensual sexual relations between two men. India repealed a similar section of its penal code in 2018.

Used Clothes Ban May Crimp Kenyan Style. It May Also Lift Local Design.,2020-07-09,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Catherine Muringo’s wardrobe consists of secondhand outfits shipped from all over the world: colorful blouses and jeans from Canada, floral dresses from the United States, trench coats from Australia and leather handbags from the United Kingdom. For years, Ms. Muringo bought the used clothes and accessories at cheap prices in open-air markets in Nairobi and used them to fashion her own idiosyncratic style. Seven years ago, she also started a business buying and selling such items, distributing castoff fur coats, hoodies and shoes to customers in Kenya and in foreign markets like Botswana, Uganda and Tanzania. But in late March, the Kenyan government banned the importation of used garments in what it said was a precautionary measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Even though used clothes are fumigated before being shipped, Kenyan authorities said they were taking precautions because of the spike in infections in countries like the United States. Now, businesses like hers are threatened, as well as the sartorial choices of millions of Kenyans who depend on low-cost imports to stay stylish. “Kenyans love to go to the secondhand markets and spend hours looking and searching,” Ms. Muringo said. “Kenyans love the diversity of secondhand.” Officials also said the banning of imported clothing — known as mitumba, the Swahili word for “bundles” — could have an unexpected benefit. It could help Kenya revive its own textile industry, which was wiped out in the late 1980s as the country started opening its markets to foreign competition. “I think corona has shown not just for Kenya but for many countries to look inward a lot and try and fill some of the market gaps,” said Phyllis Wakiaga, the chief executive of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. “The reality is that there’s a big opportunity for us to produce local clothes for the citizens.” For years, Kenya, along with other countries in East Africa, had tried to phase out used clothing to boost local manufacturing. But the countries faced the threat of being removed from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which promotes trade by providing reduced or duty-free access to the American market. Many countries backed off from instituting a ban on imported clothing, with the exception of Rwanda. The coronavirus gave Kenya a chance to promote its own clothing manufacturing, but thwarted a lively trade. In Nairobi, the combination of the import ban, plus lockdown measures and an overnight curfew introduced to stamp out the virus, have drastically lessened the hive of activity at the popular Gikomba and Toi thrift markets, mazes of narrow pathways packed with bellowing vendors and piles of clothes, shoes and household goods. As the largest importer of used clothing in East Africa, Kenya, with its new ban, is expected to upend not just supply chains but also lead to a hemorrhage in jobs connected to the trade and the loss of millions of dollars from government coffers as tax revenue and import duties fall. But where some see problems, others see opportunity. Wagura Kamwana, the proprietor of a fabric shop, the Textile Loft, is seeking to capitalize on this moment. Ms. Kamwana, 40, grew up wearing hand-stitched clothes from her mother, and later on, sought trendy outfits at secondhand markets. Kenyans like used clothes, she said, both for their affordability and because of the their high-quality fabrics. In 2016, she opened her store, offering premium quality fabrics, sourced from Europe, to Kenyans who wanted to create high-end fashion locally. In 2018, she started also offering production services to designers looking to develop smaller lines who were being turned away by factories only interested in bulk orders. Ms. Kamwana has already worked with prominent local designers like Katungulu Mwendwa. The pandemic has also offered the chance to start her own clothing line. Her new label is set to produce everyday clothing for women including dresses, scarves and trousers ranging from $25 to $150. Ms. Kamwana said designers and manufacturers should collaborate and take baby steps to push the industry toward maturity. “This whole value chain will take quite a few years to be feasible or to be seen,” she said, adding, “what we can do immediately is perfect our art of making.” Other Kenyan companies are also responding to the challenges posed by the pandemic by focusing locally. Frederick Bittiner Wear, which does fabric selection, design and tailoring for retailers in East Africa, Europe and the United States, has seen a reduction in orders because of the pandemic, so it has turned to producing leggings, T-shirts and vests for the local market, said Dominic Agesa, the managing director. After approaching distributors with samples, Mr. Agesa said he got 50 orders in a week. For too long, “Kenya has been reluctant” to incentivize local manufacturers, he said, but the import ban was one step toward making conditions more favorable for a local scene to eventually flourish. “Are we able to satisfy the Kenyan market and beyond? Mr. Agesa said. “Gradually, the answer is yes.” Suave Kenya is a brand that transforms secondhand clothes ranging from silk shirts to leather jackets into stylish and colorful tote bags, backpacks and wallets. With the import ban, its founder, Mohamed Awale, is looking into sourcing from local tanneries and textile factories. “If the pandemic persists, we will have to adapt while still producing the type of bright bags that make us unique,” said Mr. Awale, 32. “When we source locally, we create jobs and make our industries grow.” Nowhere is the shift to adapt to the changes brought on by the pandemic more visible than in the special export zones on Nairobi’s outskirts. Established in 1990, these zones offer companies less regulations plus tax incentives to promote export-oriented businesses. But with borders closed and exports plunging, some of the clothing factories have begun servicing the Kenyan market, with the country temporarily allowing manufacturers to exceed the usual limit of supplying no more than 20 percent of their annual production to local markets. Shona EPZ has 500 employees and makes reflective work clothes for companies like 3M and apparel for department stores like T.J. Maxx. But since the pandemic began, the firm has pivoted toward making personal protective equipment for Kenya, producing tens of thousands of masks and surgical gowns per day, said its director, Isaac Maluki. Mr. Maluki said he has also partnered with secondhand importers and small-scale manufacturers, that, with the ban on used clothing, are increasingly considering collaborating with larger companies like his to make clothes for local consumption. “We want to really encourage them to see the kind of quality that comes out of here that can be shared into the local market,” he said. “The local market is huge.” But before a robust clothing sector takes hold, experts say local manufacturers will have to overcome a host of challenges, including inadequate access to finance, the high cost of electricity, and the lack of raw materials, including cotton. The fact that powerful lobby groups for the secondhand clothing industry in the United States have already criticized Kenya’s move doesn’t bode well either, said Emily Anne Wolff, a researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands who has studied plans to phase out used clothing in East Africa. Kenya is aiming to be the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States, which could undermine Kenya’s will to retain the clothing ban. Used clothes traders have appealed to the government in recent days to lift the ban, saying there is no public health risk associated with the trade. But officials have so far ruled that option out. For now, Kenyan designers and manufacturers say the ban gives them a window of opportunity to start shaping the future of fashion in Kenya. “Now is a good time to make choices and changes,” said Ms. Kamwana, the owner of Textile Loft. “You will be surprised by what comes out of this country.”']","Kenya has halted imports of secondhand clothes to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Mexican Leader Vows ‘Dignity’ at Trump’s Side; Critics Fear Humiliation,2020-07-08,By Azam Ahmed and Michael Crowley,"['Before heading out for his first state visit to the United States, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the firebrand president of Mexico known for excoriating his foes in long-winded tirades, made a surprising promise to his people. He vowed to be strong and not embarrass Mexico on his first trip abroad to meet President Trump, a man seen by many Mexicans as their nation’s chief antagonist. “I am going to represent you and have no doubt, I will do as you all deserve, with decorum and a lot of dignity,” he said. It was an exceptional statement for Mr. López Obrador, whose unapologetic manner has been a hallmark since he came to office in 2018 with a landslide and a sweep of both houses of Congress. But many Mexicans have been angry at his decision to meet with Mr. Trump, especially given Mr. López Obrador’s consistent willingness to bend to the American president’s will — and the possibility Mr. Trump will gleefully remind American voters of that lopsided relationship during the meeting. Rather than fight Mr. Trump and risk the economic fallout, Mr. López Obrador has repeatedly allowed the United States to dictate major concessions on migration and force Mexico to take on much of the burden of preventing people from crossing the border. Mr. López Obrador’s visit is officially intended to celebrate the new trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which went into effect this month. But the optics for Mexico’s president are even worse because Canada’s prime minister and Trump rival, Justin Trudeau, has decided not to come, citing scheduling conflicts. The animosity between Mexicans and Mr. Trump runs deep. The American president practically launched his campaign with attacks against Mexico, and he has hardly stopped since then. Some Mexicans fear that he will simply use Mr. López Obrador to bolster his standing ahead of elections in November, while humiliating the nation once more under the pretext of celebrating trade. And they have good reason to be suspicious. Mr. Trump has bullied and badgered the Mexican government with public threats —\xa0including the prospect of broad tariffs or even closing the U.S.-Mexican border. Mexico, aware of the disproportionate impact of a strained relationship on its economy, has largely acquiesced. For Mr. Trump, the visit offers a welcome distraction from rising coronavirus infections and mass protests over police violence. With its focus on the trade pact, sometimes dubbed NAFTA 2.0, the meeting will allow Mr. Trump to talk instead about an American economy whose restoration he has made a central campaign theme. Mr. Trump is also likely to raise another defining issue for his campaign: immigration. The president considers progress on a southern border wall and a sharp drop in immigration vital to pleasing his electoral base. Mr. López Obrador, under near-constant pressure from Mr. Trump, has been instrumental in making that drop a reality. Mr. Trump enjoys “an incredible amount of leverage” over Mr. López Obrador, said Juan S. Gonzalez, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs in the Obama administration. “The Mexicans have been doing Trump’s bidding on immigration,” added Mr. Gonzalez, who advises the campaign of Mr. Trump’s 2020 Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Trump may also see potential benefit to his standing with Latino voters, 28 percent of whom supported him in 2016 despite his fierce anti-immigration stance. On Thursday, Mr. Trump is scheduled to participate in a round table with Hispanic leaders. What is less clear is the benefit for Mexico. Mexican officials say the reason for the visit is simple. The signing of a new trade deal, especially when its economy is facing the greatest recession in a century, is historic and worthy of recognition, no matter the timing —\xa0and even if many analysts expect the deal to have a modest impact on economic growth. But from nearly his first moment in office, Mr. López Obrador told his team that there would be no fighting with Mr. Trump or the U.S. government. They could not afford costly and bruising battles, and could not win them anyway. That leverage over Mexico has come to define the relationship, and it has embittered many in Mexico, including people within the government. With little in the way of recourse, Mr. López Obrador has mostly gone along with the White House agenda, especially on immigration, even though in many cases his actions stand in sharp contrast to his image as a man of the people and a benefactor of the dispossessed. To placate Mr. Trump’s ire, Mexico has transformed itself into one of the United States’ most powerful tools to halt migration. The first major shift in policy was Mexico’s acceptance of the Migrant Protection Protocols, a policy that allows the United States to send migrants seeking asylum back to Mexico as they wait out their hearings. Later, to avoid destructive tariffs threatened by Mr. Trump, Mexico deployed a new security force, the National Guard, to police its borders and prevent migrants from passing into the country. That concession shifted the forces away from the reason they were created — to fight the spiraling violence engulfing the nation. But although Mr. López Obrador’s concessions helped upend decades of established asylum policy, he paid little price in the polls. His astronomic approval ratings at the time — around 70 percent or higher — barely budged. Mr. López Obrador has shown a remarkable talent for reading the Mexican electorate and for making choices that, while deeply upsetting to his critics, have done little to dampen his overall public support. Even today, with coronavirus infections soaring and the death toll roughly five times higher than the government’s initial estimates, Mr. López Obrador still enjoys nearly 60 percent approval ratings, according to a recently published average of several polls. “The average Mexican is only interested in putting food on the table, and so in that sense this visit is the last thing that worries Obrador’s supporters,” Iliana Rodríguez, a professor of international relations at the School of Government at Tec de Monterrey, said of the Trump meeting. Mr. López Obrador has made clear that his primary focus is domestic. Appeasing Mr. Trump means the American president is less likely to interfere in domestic issues — or to punish Mexico with economic measures like tariffs. “López Obrador put his money on a strategy of détente, and ironing out tensions with our biggest commercial partner and the world’s most powerful country,” said Jorge Volpi, a novelist and columnist in Mexico. “As a head of state, that stance was correct,” Mr. Volpi added. “But that didn’t mean that it was the right decision to capitulate to all the pressures and to arrive at the point of humiliation that Mexico and Mexicans have suffered during the Trump presidency.” Others question the upside of attempting to win favor with Mr. Trump. When Mexico’s previous president invited Mr. Trump to visit during the campaign, it won him few favors from the White House and summoned the wrath of Mexicans of all political stripes. Similarly, even after pressuring Mexico to accept U.S. asylum seekers within its borders, Mr. Trump still threatened to raise tariffs if the nation did not do more to curb illegal immigration through its territory. “The notion you somehow hold him off or buy good will by becoming his political pawn — there is nothing to indicate that is true,” said Dan Restrepo, the former national security adviser for Latin America under President Obama. As his re-election bid nears, Mr. Trump has renewed his focus on cracking down on immigration, primarily across the southern border. Last month, Mr. Trump traveled to virus-gripped Arizona to survey recent construction on the border wall that he has fought bitterly with Congress to fund, with limited results. He is also expected to make a renewed effort to end a program that protects young immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation, after a June Supreme Court ruling struck down his prior attempt to kill the initiative by former President Barack Obama. A senior Trump administration official on Tuesday said the pandemic would make a traditional state dinner impractical for Mr. López Obrador, so the leaders will instead hold a kind of “state lite” dinner on Wednesday night, along with 20 Mexican and American business leaders from industries including telecommunications, energy and agriculture. Twelve Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus sent a letter to Mr. Trump last week denouncing the meeting with Mexico’s president as an effort to distract from the coronavirus and “a blatant attempt to politicize the important U.S.-Mexico relationship along partisan lines.” Notably, Mr. López Obrador did not seek to meet with Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Mr. Gonzalez, who advises Mr. Biden’s campaign, said the former vice president is “aware of the visit” but is not concerned that it will impact the November election.

Hong Kong Bans Protest Song and Other Political Expression at Schools,2020-07-08,By Gerry Mullany,"['Hong Kong’s education secretary on Wednesday banned students from singing the protest anthem “Glory to Hong Kong,” posting slogans with political messages or forming human chains, saying “the schools are obliged to stop” such activities. The statement by the secretary, Kevin Yeung, ratcheted up the pressure on the pro-democracy movement as Hong Kong residents struggle to determine what is acceptable behavior under a strict new national security law that China imposed on the semiautonomous territory last week. Students, including middle schoolers, have been a driving force in Hong Kong’s protest movement. Beijing’s imposition of the national security law last Wednesday — and the subsequent arrests of teenagers at protests — has led some families to express concerns that their children could be in jeopardy for singing pro-democracy songs or even for expressing such sentiments in their homes. Mr. Yeung made the directive in a statement responding to a question from a Hong Kong legislator, Ip Kin-yuen. The education secretary said that students had been “misled and incited to express their political stance in different ways (such as boycotting classes, chanting slogans, forming human chains, and posting slogans or singing songs which contain political messages in schools.)” Hong Kong’s education system has emerged as a particular target of the Chinese government and pro-Beijing forces in the city. China sees Hong Kong’s failure to impose a patriotic education curriculum in the schools as helping to turn them into breeding grounds for the radicalization of students. Hong Kong’s university campuses were the site of some of the most intense confrontations between the police and protesters last year. In his statement, Mr. Yeung said that the unofficial anthem of the protest movement, “Glory to Hong Kong,” should not be played, broadcast or sung in schools. The song, written and composed anonymously and then modified in online forums popular with protesters, became a rallying cry at demonstrations during the yearlong protests that engulfed the city. The song, Mr. Yeung said, “contains strong political messages and is closely related to the social and political incidents, violence and illegal incidents that have lasted for months.” “Therefore, schools must not allow students to play, sing or broadcast it in schools,” he added. The new national security law prohibits any activities found to be secessionist, subversive or terrorist in nature. The law created uncertainty around the legality of the main pro-democracy slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong — revolution of our times!” which pro-Beijing elements in the city view as a call for independence from China. But independence was not one of the five demands of the pro-democracy movement. The banning of “Glory to Hong Kong” at schools drew criticism as being “draconian.” In calling for the curtailment of political behavior at schools, the education secretary said that at least 1,600 students under the age of 18 had been arrested in the protests. “Schools are places for students to learn and grow,” he said. “They should not be used as a venue for anyone to express their political demands.”']","Singing “Glory to Hong Kong,” posting slogans and forming human chains as a form of protest are banned under new guidelines issued by the city’s education secretary."
Islamists Block Construction of First Hindu Temple in Islamabad,2020-07-08,By Maria Abi-Habib,"['A Hindu temple planned for Islamabad, the city’s first, was supposed to be a symbol of tolerance. Instead, violence and controversy have turned it into an emblem of Pakistan’s troubled relationship with its religious minorities. When Pakistan’s former government allotted land for the Shri Krishna Mandir, or Krishna temple, in 2018, Muslim demonstrators quickly camped out on the plot, refusing to allow a Hindu structure to be built in their nation’s capital. But the temple’s Hindu advocates seemed to prevail, and when the temple’s first foundation stones were laid last month, government officials proclaimed it marked the start of a new, tolerant chapter for Pakistan. Days later, Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered the government to provide about $1.3 million for the temple’s construction, roughly a fifth of what is needed. “When we broke ground, the prime minister told us in a meeting that he was quite happy that the temple would give a good image of Pakistan to the outside world,” said Lal Chand Mahli, a Hindu parliamentarian and member of the governing party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. “A Hindu temple in the capital,” he added, “was going to show the world that Pakistan is a place for all religions.” Then Muslim clerics stepped in again, and things started changing. Several clerics ruled that no Hindu temple should be built, because Pakistan is a Muslim country. Citizens denounced the government for using their taxes to provide funding for the temple. And media outlets openly campaigned to shut the project down. Under mounting pressure, the government on Friday backtracked from its initial pledge to donate money to the temple’s construction, instead asking for guidance from the Council of Islamic Ideology on whether to give the grant. The government then halted construction of a wall being built around the temple’s empty plot of land, ruling that the complex’s blueprint had to be approved first. Islamabad’s Hindu council claimed that the wall was necessary to keep vandals out, and that they worried that Muslim extremists would try to occupy the land and delay the temple’s construction as they had before. Similar barriers protect empty plots of land across Pakistan, they argued. But the government held firm. The fever pitch around the temple finally erupted on Sunday when a group of men destroyed the partially constructed wall around the temple’s land, claiming it was their Islamic duty to do so. They gleefully filmed their exploits and posted it on social media. None of the vandals have been arrested. In a matter of two weeks, the hope surrounding Islamabad’s first Hindu temple was derailed, as were any aspirations that the government of Mr. Khan would deliver on the religious coexistence he had promised when he won elections in 2018. While the plan for the temple was approved in 2017 under the former government, Mr. Khan put the plan into action and received praise for what many had hoped would mark a new, more tolerant chapter in Pakistan’s violent sectarian past. During Mr. Khan’s election campaign, he promised to improve conditions for Pakistan’s religious minorities, often treated as second-class citizens and targeted in attacks by violent Islamists with few repercussions. He also vowed to restore their places of worship. Mr. Khan seemed to make good on his promise late last year when the government reopened one of Sikhism’s holiest shrines, the 500-year-old Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur. The government hailed the reopening as proof of their religious tolerance at a time when Pakistan’s neighbor and archrival India was marginalizing their Muslim minority. On Tuesday, Amnesty International condemned the campaign against the Hindu temple and urged the government to allow the Hindu council to resume building immediately. “Prime Minister Imran Khan must lend his commitments to religious freedom for all some weight and ensure that Pakistan’s Hindus and other religious minorities are able to practice their faith freely and without fear,” said Omar Waraich, the head of Amnesty International’s South Asia department. “Every reported act of violence against minorities must be promptly investigated and those responsible must be brought to justice. A recurrence can only be prevented if adequate measures are taken,” Mr. Waraich added. Although Hindus are between two and four percent of Pakistan’s population, Islamabad does not have a temple for them to worship in. If their relatives die, they must travel long distances with the body to Hindu-run cremation facilities to perform traditional burial rites. Founded as a state for South Asia’s Muslims, Pakistan had a secular, democratic Constitution crafted by the father of the nation, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who is still revered across the country. But the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 unleashed a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims that both nations have not recovered from, decades later. Neighbors turned on each other to cleanse their villages, towns and cities of Hindu or Muslim minorities. Although estimates vary, up to 2 million may have been killed in the violence. Amendments to the Constitution, followed by a wave of Islamic radicalization within the powerful armed forces, have seen Pakistan morph into a considerably more sectarian nation than Mr. Jinnah had envisioned. “Pakistan is a religiously diverse place and people of different religions live in the country. Islamabad is our capital and all religions have equal rights in it,” said Mr. Mahli, the Hindu parliamentarian. “Jinnah promised our rights would be upheld when the country was created.” Zia ur-Rehman contributed reporting.']","The government hailed the temple as a sign of Pakistan’s growing tolerance under Prime Minister Imran Khan.

"The Killing of Qassim Suleimani Was Unlawful, Says U.N. Expert",2020-07-09,By Nick Cumming-Bruce,"['GENEVA — A United Nations expert investigating summary executions said on Thursday that the United States’ targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran was unlawful and risked eroding international laws that govern the conduct of hostilities. Agnes Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur investigating extrajudicial and summary executions, said that the American drone strike that killed General Suleimani as he arrived in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in January could only be justified in international law as a response to an imminent threat. The United States had provided no evidence to support that position, she said. “Absent an actual imminent threat to life, the course of action taken by the U.S. was unlawful,” Ms. Callamard wrote in a report that she presented on Thursday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. The retaliatory missile attacks Iran launched against American bases in Iraq five days later were also “completely outside the scope of what is permissible” in international law, Ms. Callamard said. Ms. Callamard’s report as a United Nations independent expert is intended as an international wake-up call that will help to generate critical scrutiny and action on issues hitherto debated mainly by academics, lawyers and security experts. There is an urgent need for international action to monitor and regulate the use of drones and the threat they pose to international law, Ms. Callamard said. In the absence of a clear legal framework for holding states accountable for drone strikes, she called for the U.N. Security Council to review all targeted killings and for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit annual reports on drone strike casualties. In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned Ms. Callamard’s report as “spurious” and said that it “gives more cause to distrust U.N. human rights mechanisms.”  General Suleimani commanded Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the military that ran clandestine operations across the Middle East and was designated by President Trump as a foreign terrorist organization in April 2019. President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said they ordered the strike in response to an imminent threat of attack but provided no evidence in official explanations to Congress and the United Nations. In a memo to Congress, the administration said only that it carried out the strike as a response to previous Iranian attacks and “to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces and interests.” The information that Trump administration officials provided was “remarkably vague and inconsequential as far as a possible imminent threat is concerned,” Ms. Callamard wrote in the report. “Even at the most basic level, the U.S. did not demonstrate that striking Suleimani was ‘necessary.’” Instead, she said, the United States strike on General Suleimani set an alarming precedent for the use of drones in targeted killings. Until January, such strikes had been limited to individuals in nonstate groups. Ms. Callamard said that the United States attack on General Suleimani was the first targeted drone killing of a senior foreign government official on the territory of a third country. “It is hard to imagine that a similar strike against a Western military leader would not be considered as an act of war,” she wrote. As a result of the killing, the international community faced “the very real prospect that states may opt to ‘strategically’ eliminate high ranking military officials outside the context of a ‘known’ war, and seek to justify the killing on the grounds of the target’s classification as a ‘terrorist’ who posed a potential future threat,” Ms. Callamard said in her report. “If you have a few more countries moving in that direction, the real risks of global conflagration are becoming very high,” she told reporters in Geneva. “There are no red lines.” Ms. Callamard presented her findings on the killing of General Suleimani as a case study illustrating the wider dangers posed by what she called the “extremely scary” unregulated growth in the use of armed drones and the dramatic escalation of their capabilities. The armed forces of at least 102 countries now operated drones, she said, along with at least 20 nonstate actors, including the Islamic State and the Libyan militia led by General Khalifa Hifter. Around 40 states possessed or were procuring armed drones, and at least 11 countries had used drones for military strikes, including targeted killings. Ms. Callamard also attacked the notion that armed drones enabled precise, surgical strikes as “a myth,” citing the heavy civilian casualties inflicted in the course of drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen, often as a result of faulty intelligence. Ms. Callamard said that analysis of classified data on American drone strikes in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011 found they were ten times more likely to cause civilian casualties than conventional air attacks. Data from Pakistan in 2015 indicated that missed strikes on 24 individuals had killed more than 870 other people.

"Russia Arrests Space Agency Official, Accusing Him of Treason",2020-07-07,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Russia’s secret police on Tuesday arrested a respected former reporter who worked in recent months as an adviser to the head of the country’s space agency, accusing him of treason for passing secrets to a NATO country. Life News, a tabloid news site with close ties to the security apparatus, posted a video of the former reporter, Ivan I. Safronov, being bundled off a leafy Moscow street into a gray van by plainclothes officers of the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the domestic arm of what was known in Soviet times as the K.G.B. The F.S.B. said that Mr. Safronov was suspected of working for the intelligence service of an unspecified NATO country, passing on “classified information about military-technical cooperation, defense and the security of the Russian Federation.” What information that could be, however, was unclear. Mr. Safronov only started working at the space agency, Roscosmos, in May. Before that, he worked for more than a decade as a well-regarded journalist for Kommersant and then Vedomosti, both privately owned business newspapers with no obvious access to state secrets. Outraged at what was widely viewed as another example of overreach by Russia’s sprawling and often paranoid security apparatus, journalists and ordinary Muscovites gathered in small groups outside the headquarters of the F.S.B. to protest the arrest. Several were detained for holding up signs in support of Mr. Safronov. Andrei A. Soldatov, an investigative reporter who has written extensively about Russia’s security services, said Mr. Safronov’s arrest on suspicion of treason marked “an absolutely new level of repression against journalism.” While journalists have often been accused of crimes, he said, accusations of treason had been “inconceivable.” Even journalists known for their zealous loyalty to the authorities expressed unease. Margarita Simonyan, the chief editor of Kremlin-funded television network RT, tweeted that “it would be good to get an explanation of what exactly Safronov is accused of — journalist work for foreigners or direct work for foreign special services. There is a huge difference.” With hundreds of journalists working abroad for RT, Ms. Simonyan clearly worries that Mr. Safronov’s troubles could be used by foreign governments as an excuse to justify detaining her own employees, who have often been accused of peddling propaganda for the Kremlin. Russian journalists who take on the authorities are frequently harassed, detained, framed and even killed. In a rare reversal, the government in June last year dropped a case against Ivan Golunov, an investigative reporter arrested on bogus narcotics charges. The evidence against him was widely believed to have been manufactured by the police on orders from the F.S.B. to punish Mr. Golunov for reporting work that upset the financial interests of security officers. The authorities ultimately acknowledged that the evidence had been fabricated. On Monday, a court in western Russia convicted another journalist, Svetlana Prokopyeva, of terrorism-related charges that even the Kremlin’s own human rights council had described as unwarranted. In a statement on Tuesday, the newspaper where Mr. Safronov had worked, Kommersant, described its former journalist as a “true patriot of Russia” and scorned claims of treason as “absurd.” It said that Mr. Safronov had joined the newspaper to take a job covering defense issues that was previously held by his father, also named Ivan, who died in March 2007 after falling from the fifth floor of a Moscow apartment building. Prosecutors at the time described the fall as a suicide, but colleagues scorned this explanation and suspected possible foul play. The older Mr. Safronov died after publishing a series of scoops that had infuriated the Russian military. Roscosmos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr. Safronov had been arrested on suspicion of treason but said that the detention did not relate to his work at the agency. At the same time, the Kremlin said that the arrest had nothing to do with his previous work as a journalist, which included coverage of President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said he did not know how Mr. Safronov could have obtained classified information whose disclosure would qualify as treason, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Trials involving state secrets are generally closed to the public, making it impossible for anyone outside the system to know whether there is any real evidence. A former American marine, Paul N. Whelan, received a 16-year jail sentence for espionage last month after a closed trial that the U.S. ambassador to Russia, John J. Sullivan, denounced as a “mockery of justice.” The arrest on Tuesday of Mr. Safronov prompted dismay and anger among journalists, including those who have mostly avoided open confrontation with the authorities. Elena Chernenko, a foreign affairs journalist at Kommersant, Mr. Safronov’s former newspaper, staged a one-person picket, the only form of protest permitted without prior approval, outside the headquarters of the F.S.B., holding up a sign demanding “information and justice in connection with Ivan Safronov.” Police officers took her away. Even Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, seemed surprised by the arrest of a journalist who had once worked in the Kremlin pool and whom he had previously described as highly talented. “Ivan will have a chance to defend himself,” Mr. Peskov told journalists on Tuesday. Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow. ']","The detention of Ivan Safronov, a former journalist who had been working as an adviser at Roscosmos, took many by surprise.

Travel Restrictions on Americans Erode a Sense of Passport Privilege,2020-07-07,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — Five American travelers who set out for a getaway on Sardinia were turned away last week after their private jet landed on the Mediterranean island. In Canada, two Americans were fined for flouting tougher entry restrictions imposed by their northern neighbor. And in Mexico, governors are pleading with the central government to introduce tighter restrictions on travelers from the United States to help prevent the spread of the virus. While coronavirus travel restrictions may vary from country to country, much of the world is united in one aspect of their current response: Travelers from the United States are not welcome. A U.S. passport, long seen as a golden ticket to visa-free travel in much of the world, has long provided its holders with the ability to trot around the globe with ease. Now, that sense of passport privilege Americans are used to is fading. “This is shocking, to see one of the most advanced countries in the world be put in the slow lane of the global reopening,” said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the London research institution for international affairs. Mr. Niblett said the fading power of the American passport was not surprising “given that America’s health care system is decentralized, unpredictable and unequal” and given how the virus continues to spread unabated in large portions of the country. In a world where pandemic travel restrictions are excluding people from countries with uncontrolled coronavirus outbreaks, and where the United States continues to set daily records of new cases, the long-lauded American passport, once a symbol of power and exceptionalism, is becoming stigmatized. Last week, when the European Union formalized a plan to restart travel from certain countries, visitors from the United States were notably left off the list, a stinging blow to American prestige. American citizens who live in countries on the approved list will be allowed to enter the European Union. Travelers from the United States, like those blocked from the Italian island of Sardinia last week, are finding themselves unwanted. The five Americans who had flown to Sardinia had come from Colorado, traveling with several people from other nations in a private jet to the Italian island. After five in the group were barred entry, everyone eventually left. Dimitry Kochenov, a co-creator of The Quality of Nationality Index, which explores the benefits accorded to citizens of different countries, said the pandemic restrictions put into stark relief the restrictions that people of certain nationalities faced at international borders. “Citizenship is the main factor behind preserving global inequalities today,” he said. “So of course the U.S. passport has always symbolized the ultimate level of this privilege.” Mr. Kochenov, a professor of European constitutional law at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, said the Sardinia incident showed that even the large sums of money needed to fly a personal plane to Europe could not “allow them to overcome the deficiency of the U.S. passport today.” While a U.S. passport typically allows for visa-free movement in much of the world, Mr. Kochenov noted that European Union passports outrank it in quality because they grant holders the freedom to resettle anywhere in the European Union with full rights. Until the recent restrictions, the U.S. passport had long provided its holders with an outsize sense of freedom that was the envy of others. The restrictions that Americans now face are “something that much of the rest of the world knows very well,” Mr. Kochenov said. Some Americans say they have been surprised by the shift in perception toward American travelers during the pandemic, expressing concerns that it could be damaging, at least symbolically. Vincent Rajkumar, a professor of medicine in Minnesota who became a U.S. citizen 15 years ago, said he has always been in awe of how the country’s passport had opened doors that were once shut to him. During a trip to Australia in January, he was alarmed that passengers were being questioned extensively about whether they had been to China. “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, I’m so glad I have a U.S. passport, this is never going to happen to me,’” he said. “And then in the past two months, this is dawning on me — ‘This is going to happen to us. This is happening to us.’” ShaDonna Jackson, a photographer from Maryland who has been vocal on social media about seeking dual citizenship, said she was spurred to act in part by the new restrictions on U.S. travelers. “The perception of the U.S. right now in terms of how safe people are with the coronavirus spreading — I see how it can be scary to other countries,” she said. Mr. Niblett of Chatham House noted the turn of events was unsurprising after the United States issued a broad travel ban for European visitors in March, which gave implicit permission for other governments to do the same against Americans. President Trump’s abrupt decision, which was made without consultation with European leaders and without any warning, established the climate for the current travel restrictions on the United States. “When it’s done in that incredibly indiscriminate way, then it’s not surprising you get this counterreaction from American allies,” Mr. Niblett said, adding that Mr. Trump had “set the stage very much for this. And to be honest, it’s tragic.” The travel restrictions reflect the eroding relationship between Europe and the United States. Since Mr. Trump became president, the trans-Atlantic relationship is “becoming more shallow” despite the decades of cooperation after World War II, Mr. Niblett said. Diplomacy has “become more transactional” and focused on the short term. “And Europe now feels they have a right to be equally transactional in return,” Mr. Niblett said. But the sentiment is not coming only from Europe. American travelers to Canada who have attempted to skirt border restrictions that ban all but essential journeys have found themselves equally unwelcome. They face fines or being detained for failing to comply. Nova Scotia’s leader expressed frustration about travelers from America trying to circumvent restrictions by coming into the Canadian province. At the Mexican border, there has also been a stark reversal. Typically on the receiving end of border restrictions, Mexico, alarmed by the spiking infection rate in the United States, has moved to stem the flow of Americans into the country. Mexican states set up “sanitary filters”along the border during the July 4 weekend to check visitors’ temperatures and turn away anyone whose trip was not deemed essential. Officials in Mexican border states  have pushed for more aggressive steps to reduce crossings. Mr. Kochenov pointed out that simply focusing on the erosion of freedoms for American travelers missed the bigger picture. Many countries have introduced internal travel restrictions that limit movement among regions, states or other local jurisdictions. And most of the current restrictions are expected to be temporary. Americans may not like having their travels limited for now, but it is likely to be for the short term. Others will continue to face a tougher reality. “The majority of the population of the world will never be able to fly to Europe no matter what,” Mr. Kochenov said, because of visa restrictions or lack of money. “The pandemic simply demonstrates to Americans what the rest of the world has already known about the main function of nationality in the world.” Natalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from Mexico City.']","As countries across the world ease coronavirus restrictions but block American travelers, a long-held sense that the U.S. passport was a golden ticket is losing its luster."
"In Russia, They Tore Down Lots of Statues, but Little Changed",2020-07-07,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Elated by the defeat of a hard-line Communist coup in August 1991, thousands of mostly young Muscovites gathered in front of the K.G.B. headquarters and argued over how best to seal their victory with a bold, symbolic act. After some discussion, recalled Sergei B. Parkhomenko, then a young journalist covering the scene, the crowd turned its passion — more euphoria than anger, he said — on the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the ruthless founder of the Soviet secret police, which stood in a traffic circle in front of the Lubyanka, the forbidding stone building that housed the K.G.B. The removal of the statue, accomplished with help from a crane sent by Moscow city authorities, was greeted with cries of “Down with the K.G.B.” and sent a powerful message that change had finally come to Russia. Or so it seemed at the time. Nearly 30 years later, Russia is ruled by a former K.G.B. officer, President Vladimir V. Putin, and Dzerzhinsky is honored with a bust outside the Moscow city police headquarters. As the United States boils with anger over police brutality and racism, the experience of Russia since the collapse of Communism offers a cautionary lesson in the perils and disappointments of toppling monuments. Russia never engaged in a deep reckoning with its Soviet past, airing injustices and holding people accountable. Instead, atrocities were glossed over and some of the old elite, particularly in the security services, has reconstituted itself in power. Mr. Parkhomenko said he had no regrets about the removal of Dzerzhinsky — known as “Iron Felix” because of his unbending defense of Soviet Communism — and certainly doesn’t want him back. But he lamented that what had been a highly gratifying symbolic strike against the old order did not bury, or even really dent, the system the statue represented. “Everything has turned around,” he said. “The putsch failed, but 30 years later it has won. Russia’s power system today is much closer to what the putsch wanted to achieve than what those who protested against it wanted. This is our great tragedy.” The Dzerzhinsky statue was initially dumped on the ground outside a Moscow gallery of modern art along with other “fallen heroes” — among them a pink granite statue of Stalin, his face smashed by hammer blows, and a bronze statue of Yakov Sverdlov, an early Bolshevik leader, toppled in 1991 from a square facing the Bolshoi Theater. They are all now back on their feet as part of the Muzeon Park of Arts, a state-managed open-air exhibition that also includes artistic tributes to their victims, like a 1998 work called Victims of Totalitarian Regimes, a long wire cage containing sculpted stone heads. Every few years, the Communist Party calls for Dzerzhinsky’s return to his pedestal in front of what is now the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the post-Soviet name of an otherwise little-changed K.G.B. But the symbolism of that would be too much, even for Mr. Putin. The Kremlin has mostly focused on erecting new statues, not restoring those demolished in the 1990s. Among the new additions is a towering monument to Lt. Gen. Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, the designer of the AK-47 assault rifle. The bronze statue, erected in 2017 on one of Moscow’s busiest thoroughfares, depicts General Kalashnikov cradling one of his automatics, looking from a distance like an aging heavy metal guitarist. News broadcasts on Russian state television have been filled in recent days with scornful reports about statues coming under attack in the United States. They lament that Christopher Columbus, Confederate generals and other historical figures have been targeted by what is depicted as rage-filled vandalism. But Russia’s dismay is also felt by many liberal-minded intellectuals who do not watch state television or share its jingoistic glee at troubles in the West, but have lived through their own country’s efforts to shake off its past. “Waging war on bronze men doesn’t make your life any more moral or just,” said Maria Lipman, who worked in Moscow as a journalist as Communism was collapsing and cheered when Dzerzhinsky was taken down. “It does nothing really.” Statues of Stalin, the Soviet dictator who died in 1953, quickly vanished across the empire he ruled. One prominent exception was his hometown, Gori, in Georgia, which waited until 2010 to remove him from its central square. Today, however, the tyrant, whose body was removed in 1961 from a mausoleum in Red Square that still holds Lenin’s corpse, has never been more popular in Russia. An opinion poll last year found a record 70 percent thought Stalin played a positive role in Russian history. “Deleting doesn’t work,” said Nina Khrushcheva, a Russia expert at the New School in New York City whose grandfather, the former Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, tried to break the grip of Stalinism, only to be ousted from power in a 1964 Kremlin coup. “Denouncing Stalin was Khrushchev’s greatest achievement, but removing him from all public spaces, trying to delete that history, was a big mistake,” she said. “Once you demolish somebody’s hero you only incite hatred and force feelings underground.” Mikhail Y. Schneider, a pro-democracy activist who led protesters to the K.G.B. headquarters in August 1991, said attacking Dzerzhinsky’s statue was a “great emotional release” that “helped us believe we were living in a different country,” but “it changed nothing.” For real change, he said, the removal of Soviet-era symbols needed to be accompanied by a program of exposing crimes, putting those responsible on trial and returning confiscated property. “It is now too late,” he added. In a few lands liberated by the demise of Moscow’s empire, the swift removal of statues had a powerful impact. Three tiny Baltic nations quickly purged streets and parks of Soviet heroes as part of a broad and highly successful drive to rejoin the West and escape Moscow’s shadow. But Russia, where Soviet rule was a home-grown phenomenon, has struggled to confront an era that is still remembered with pride by many as a time of Russian grandeur. That seemingly immovable certainties enshrined in public monuments can and do change is a theme explored by a new art installation at Garage, a museum of contemporary art in Moscow. The installation, called Transformer and made up of interchangeable pieces that are regularly rearranged, was inspired by a square in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, that has had six different names and eight different monuments over the past century. Whether statues should stand or fall has been a topic of heated debate for decades in former Soviet lands. Ukraine, particularly, has demolished Lenin statues and other monuments with gusto, seeing them as symbols of past subjugation to Moscow. But this did nothing to make Ukraine any less corrupt or its officials any more accountable. Instead, it widened divisions between the Russian-speaking east of the country, which has clung to its statues of Lenin as totems of identity, and the rest of Ukraine. When protesters in Kyiv, the capital, toppled Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin president in February 2014, Russian-speaking agitators in the country’s east set up an armed camp around a statue of Lenin in the city of Donetsk, vowing to defend it from what they said would be imminent vandalism. Defense of Lenin against attacks that never came stoked emotion, rallied resistance to the new government in Kyiv and helped turn what began as a local quarrel over language and identity into a full-scale war. Fanned by Moscow, which sent fighters and weapons, the conflict, now it its sixth year, has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Aleksei P. Kondaurov, a retired K.G.B. officer who was working late in the Lubyanka when protesters gathered outside in August 1991 and began attacking Dzerzhinsky, worried that events could easily spin out of control. He said he told armed guards not to shoot if protesters tried to enter the mostly empty building.

Serbia Protests Meet Violent Response in Europe’s 1st Major Virus Unrest,2020-07-09,By Patrick Kingsley,"['Thousands of Serbs demonstrated for a second consecutive night on Wednesday in response to President Aleksandar Vucic’s management of the coronavirus crisis and wider concerns over the state of democracy in Serbia. The protests were the first major pandemic-related unrest in Europe since the start of the crisis, and were met by a violent police response that some analysts said they had not witnessed in Serbia since the rule of Slobodan Milosevic, who governed Serbia during the 1990s. Serbs first took to the streets on Tuesday, soon after Mr. Vucic announced that Belgrade would be placed under a new three-day lockdown following a second wave of confirmed coronavirus infections. But the demonstrations quickly morphed into a wider expression of frustration at Mr. Vucic’s increasing control over policymaking and perceived mismanagement of Serbia’s pandemic response. The protests continued on Wednesday, even after Mr. Vucic suspended his decision to enforce a second shutdown. Protesters said they were less angry about the re-implementation of the lockdown than the governmental missteps that had created the need for renewed restrictions in the first place. These included decisions to proceed with a general election last week and to restart large public sports events. “We don’t mind staying home for another three days — that wasn’t the problem,” said Dragana Grncarski, 45, a fashion events manager who protested on both days. “However, they’re playing with our minds and with the truth,” Ms. Grncarski added. “When it suits them to do elections, there is no corona. They organized football matches and tennis matches, and because of that we have a situation where the hospitals are full.” After initially enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns in March, Mr. Vucic lifted social restrictions in early May, claiming his government had defeated the coronavirus. But while other European countries eased their lockdowns gradually, Mr. Vucic opted for a faster process, soon allowing Serbs to gather by the tens of thousands without social distancing at sports matches and to crowd into reopened nightclubs. “We went from one extreme to another,” said Jelena Vasiljevic, an expert on Balkan protest movements at the University of Belgrade. Mr. Vucic initially refused to change course on the re-openings, even as the daily number of new cases rose from below 20 to above 300 and investigative news reports suggested that the toll could be even higher. He pressed ahead with a controversial general election on June 21 that most opposition parties had long planned to boycott, saying they did not want to legitimize a process that they feel is gamed in Mr. Vucic’s favor. And to Mr. Vucic’s critics, his decision first to ease restrictions ahead of a vote that was certain to increase his power — and then reinstate them soon after — felt like he was playing politics with public health. “Citizens have been constantly deceived and lied to for political ends,” said Tena Prelec, an expert on politics in southeast Europe at the University of Oxford. Analysts said the spontaneous nature of the protests reflected the lack of institutional means to express dissent. Under Mr. Vucic, the quality of Serbian democracy has fallen from “free” to only “partly free,” according to Freedom House, an independent Washington-based watchdog that makes an annual assessment of each country’s political freedoms. “The media and state institutions are completely consumed by one party,” said Dr. Vasiljevic. On Tuesday night, some protesters briefly entered the Parliament building before being forced out by police. Law enforcement officials were later filmed beating unarmed protesters with batons, in scenes that some analysts said mirrored police behavior during the rule of Mr. Milosevic, who led Serbia through the Balkan Wars and was later tried for war crimes in The Hague. “The excessive use of force — we haven’t seen that since Milosevic in 1996 or 1997,” Dr. Vasiljevic said. Mr. Vucic said police were right to respond with force. “There were indications of foreign involvement, and some criminal faces were there, too,” Mr. Vucic said, speaking on Wednesday afternoon, before the second night of protests. “The aim was to damage Serbia’s international image,” he added. The protests could soon fizzle because of their leaderless nature, the lack of a clear goal and the strength of Mr. Vucic’s grip on Serbia, Dr. Vasiljevic said. Similar mass demonstrations dissipated last year without forcing concessions from Mr. Vucic. “This situation is a bit different,” said Dr. Vasiljevic. “But we still need to have some clear political articulations, and a clear political narrative.”']","To counter a second coronavirus wave, President Aleksandar Vucic announced a new lockdown.

Macron Drops Idea of a Modern Spire for Notre-Dame,2020-07-09,By Aurelien Breeden,"['President Emmanuel Macron of France on Thursday dropped the unpopular idea of building a modern spire atop a restored Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, a possibility he had floated after a devastating fire sent the previous spire crashing through the roof. Just days after a blaze tore through the beloved cathedral in April last year, Mr. Macron, surprising many, suggested replacing the lost spire with a “contemporary architectural gesture.” French authorities proposed a prestigious international architectural competition to replace the spire, leading to a flurry of preliminary proposals that ranged from the modern to the madcap, including a beam of light, glass-covered gardens and a 300-foot, carbon-fiber flame. But the idea of a modern spire never caught on with critics or with public opinion, and Mr. Macron never committed to it. Polls showed a majority in favor of restoring the 19th-century spire designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, a French architect who headed a major restoration of the cathedral. The original spire, which stood for five and a half centuries, deteriorated badly and was removed in the 18th century. Mr. Macron’s office said in a statement on Thursday that he had “become convinced” that Notre-Dame had to be restored in a way that was “as true as possible” to its “complete, coherent and last known state.” The presidency also acknowledged that Mr. Macron, who has set a tight, five-year deadline to reopen the cathedral for worship and tourism by 2024, did not want to “delay” or “complicate” the reconstruction with an architectural competition. Instead, the area surrounding the cathedral could be modernized with a “contemporary gesture,” in “close collaboration” with Paris City Hall, Mr. Macron’s office said, without providing details. Jean-Michel Léniaud, a historian and Viollet-le-Duc expert who sits on a council advising the task force in charge of restoring Notre-Dame, expressed satisfaction with the decision. “Notre-Dame is a national and international symbol” that unites people, he said, and departing from its world-famous architecture would have had a “divisive effect.” “Would we paint the White House red, for modernity’s sake?” Mr. Léniaud said. Mr. Macron’s decision came right after the National Heritage and Architecture Commission, an advisory body that handles important restoration projects, unanimously approved recommendations by architects that Notre-Dame be restored to its prior state. That includes rebuilding the spire as designed by Viollet-le-Duc and using original materials like wood for the roofing, in order to “guarantee the authenticity, the harmony and the coherence of this masterpiece of Gothic architecture,” the restoration task force said in a statement on Thursday. The president’s office said that Mr. Macron trusted the commission’s “expertise.” “I am happy that the French, pilgrims and visitors from around the world will once again meet with the cathedral that they love,” Gen. Jean-Louis Georgelin, a former army chief of staff named by Mr. Macron to head the task force, said in the statement. The fire last year destroyed the latticework of huge, ancient timbers that made up Notre-Dame’s attic, melted the roof’s lead sheath and endangered the overall stability of the iconic stone structure that had stood for eight centuries. Molten metal, flaming beams and the spire fell into the cathedral’s interior, doing further damage. Progress toward restoring Notre-Dame has been halting. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, workers had to shore up the building to prevent it from collapsing, but bad weather, worries over lead contamination and the coronavirus pandemic — which led to a temporary shutdown of the site — prevented them from doing much more. Most recently, workers hanging from ropes have started using hand saws to delicately remove about 40,000 pieces of charred, twisted scaffolding — remnants of prior renovations that were melted in the fire. The old scaffolding, which weighs about 200 tons, has to be taken down before the architects can fully assess the state of the building and plan its reconstruction.']",The French president had floated the idea of replacing the fire-ravaged cathedral’s 19th-century spire with a “contemporary architectural gesture.” Few were in favor.
"Cairo Badly Needed a Detox. Lockdown Supplied One, at a Steep Price.",2020-07-09,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — If ever a city needed a good detox, it was Cairo. Centuries of turbulent history, topped with recent decades of chaotic urban development, have left the ancient metropolis in poor physical shape. Its complexion is parched and blemished. Traffic clogs its throbbing arteries. It has signs of major stress. The coronavirus obliged. Three months of lockdown, including an 11-hour nightly curfew, imposed a rejuvenating deep cleanse on Cairo. Roads once choked with honking cars ran free. The air, free of fumes, seemed to sparkle. Silence flooded the streets. At my apartment near the Nile, a bedroom that was barely usable because of the morning din became an oasis of calm. In the evenings, my family gathered on the balcony to witness sunsets that were more saturated than ever. The pollution app on my phone glowed an unfamiliar green. Of course, it came at a jarring price. On dawn runs down deserted streets, I passed anxious-looking people wearing masks, crowded around the entrance to a hospital. And then it was over. Toward the end of June, the government announced it was allowing mosques, restaurants and coffee houses to reopen. On the last night of curfew, I scrambled into the streets to capture its delicate pleasures one final time. Hundreds of Egyptians, it turned out, had the same idea. They clustered at dusk on a bridge, watching the squadron of kites that fluttered in the hot breeze shooting down the Nile. Young men in skinny jeans tugged on strings. Veiled women chased after dating couples, trying to sell them roses. Inevitably, the fun tweaked Egypt’s rulers, always wary of unsanctioned public gatherings. A senior lawmaker warned that the crowded skies posed a threat to national security because Egypt’s enemies could fit the kites with surveillance cameras. But on the bridge, nobody cared for such talk, preferring to wallow in this odd moment, between serenity and anxiety, when their city’s famously frenetic pulse had been slowed by a virus. I chatted with two brothers who held aloft a giant kite emblazoned with photographs of themselves, preening, and the soccer star Mohamed Salah, who was beaming. Nearby, Samiha Meneim, 62, perched on a rickety plastic chair, surrounded by 15 family members as well as half-eaten platters of koshary, Egypt’s national dish of spiced lentils, rice and macaroni. The picnic was a mercy dash after months cooped up in their cramped, low-rent neighborhood. “We had to get out,” said Ms. Meneim, a retired nurse in a black cloak who continued her treatment for breast cancer throughout the lockdown. She saw the coronavirus as a message from God. “He wants us to look at life differently,” she said. For much of Egypt’s history, its fate has been shaped by the Nile. The bridge of kites led to Roda Island, described in “One Thousand and One Nights” as a place of heavenly gardens, now a tight sprawl of dust-smeared apartment blocks. At its southern tip, though, there survives a Nilometer built in the ninth century —\xa0a structure that measured the river’s seasonal flooding and thus predicted the annual harvest. Now, disease was dictating the pace of life. As night fell and the curfew officially began, I crossed into downtown Cairo, a jumble of old palaces, crumbling elegance and gaudy shop fronts where, in normal times, the traffic is so crazy that guidebooks offer tourists solemn advice on how to survive. “Look for locals and join a group,” advises my edition of National Geographic Traveler. “They cross all together, one lane at a time.” That night it would have taken a miracle to get knocked down. The strays were in charge —\xa0skinny cats that strutted down empty boulevards, for once unbothered, and a pair of lordly street dogs that snoozed atop an SUV. The Metro Cinema, with its dust-encrusted Art Deco facade, opened in 1940 with “Gone With the Wind.” Now it had the eerie air of an abandoned film set, advertising the Egyptian movies it had been showing in March: “Peep Show,” and “The Thief of Baghdad.” In the late 19th century, Egypt’s ruler, Khedive Ismail, modeled this area on the airy elegance of Haussmann’s Paris, but for decades the graceful buildings have gradually crumbled into disrepair. Now, in the desolation of curfew, they seemed to stand proud again, as did the statues lining the way. The giant bronze lions that guard Qasr el Nil, the city’s most scenic bridge, looked more relaxed than ever with no foe in sight. The mix of eerie desolation and faded splendor had a touch of magic, and for an instant I thought of the Egyptian version of the movie “Night at the Museum,” in which the bronze lions come to life under darkness. But I was not entirely alone. Teenagers clustered conspiratorially in doorways. Food-delivery riders clustered around their motorcycles outside a restaurant. Business was brisk. “If it keeps going like this,” remarked Mahmoud Abdel Fattah, leaning over his handlebars, “I’ll be as rich as Naguib Sawiris” —\xa0an outspoken billionaire who has been a vociferous critic of the lockdown measures. Still, Mr. Fattah noted wryly that, at 28 cents per delivery, that fortune could take a while. “Maybe after one million pizzas,” he quipped. For all their ebullience, the deliverymen also had a downbeat air. Sure, they could zoom to any address in minutes. But Cairo without the grit, the grind, the bustle of people — was it really Cairo at all? Plagues are nothing new in Cairo. On a visit to Cairo in the 14th century, when the city’s 500,000 inhabitants made it the world’s largest city outside China, the explorer Ibn Battuta noted that an outbreak of the bubonic plague was killing as many as 20,000 people a day. Cholera hit repeatedly in the 19th century.  This time, the human cost is amplified by Egypt’s soaring population, which in February crossed the 100 million threshold, an unnerving milestone in a densely packed country. Outside the city center, the lockdown has been loosely observed —\xa0social distancing is little more than an admirable idea in the city’s cramped slums. Many Egyptians wear masks over their chins or spurn them entirely, much to the chagrin of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a fitness enthusiast who has urged Egyptians to stay safe, keep fit and lose weight during the lockdown. “Remember to do sport, it increases immunity levels,” he said in May. Otherwise, it has been business as usual for Mr. el-Sisi during the lockdown — with the arrest of rights activists, belly dancers and even young women who post dance videos to social media. The virus, though, cannot be banished so easily. Egypt has over 77,000 known cases, and confirmed infections have grown by about 1,400 cases a day for the past month. Egypt has registered more than 3,400 deaths, the highest toll in the Arab world. In an ominous portent, Mr. el-Sisi last week opened a 4,000-bed field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. And the economic toll is only now becoming apparent. Millions of workers have lost income, and families are cutting back on meat and other items that are now unaffordable. The International Monetary Fund has lent $8 billion to get Egypt through the crisis. More may be needed.  The day after the lockdown was lifted, I walked the same route again. The sense of magic had evaporated. Police officers patrolled the bridge where the kites had flown. The familiar rumble of traffic snarled the downtown, where some restaurants had opened. But others remained shut —\xa0it’s not worth it yet, the manager of Abou Tarek, the city’s most celebrated koshary emporium, told me \xa0— and there was talk that some restrictions could become permanent. Rules obliging restaurants and coffee houses to shut at 10 p.m. will remain after the virus, a cabinet spokesman said — an announcement that was consistent with Mr. el-Sisi’s desire to “civilize” Egyptians, but that met with muted indignation in a city famous for its vibrant all-night socializing. Egyptian rulers have announced similar detox measures in the past, only to quickly backtrack in the face of popular resistance. For now, what’s certain is that Cairenes are staying home, caught between their desire to get back to normal and their fear of what may be coming next — much like everywhere else.

"‘Whac-a-Mole’ Against Virus Sounds Reasonable, Unless You’re the Mole",2020-07-09,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LEICESTER, England — Fresh buttercream wastes away in an empty cake shop. Young men slip past the lockdown border to reopened pubs in nearby towns. And neighbors blame neighbors for a new outbreak of the coronavirus that has stalled their return to something resembling normal life. In Leicester, a city of ramshackle garment factories and multigenerational homes in the heart of England, the imposition of a second lockdown late last month has induced a sort of whiplash among people who were still recovering from the first. The city of 340,000 in the East Midlands was shuttered as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to play “Whac-a-Mole” with the virus, bringing a mallet down on any areas suffering an outbreak. But carving a stay-at-home border around one region while others hurry back to pubs and jobs has proved to be a convoluted and divisive step. And it illuminates the difficulties that countries across Europe and Asia will face as they try to battle local flare-ups of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Weeks of delays by the government in giving local officials in England details about test results made it difficult to detect clusters of new infections before they spread. With sweatshops employing mostly underpaid South Asian immigrant workers operating during lockdown, Leicester was a prime candidate for a second outbreak. Its garment workers were packed together not only in the factories but also at home — confined spaces where the virus can easily spread. Once known for “clothing the world,” Leicester has struggled as larger manufacturers moved overseas. It recently ranked as the 21st most deprived of more than 300 local authorities in England. And now, residents complain, it has to shoulder the reputation of becoming England’s first city to be convulsed a second time by the coronavirus. “The only time people have known how to say ‘Leicester’ is when we won the Premier League and we found a dead king,” said Dharmesh Lakhani, the owner of Bobby’s, an Indian restaurant, on the city’s normally bustling Belgrave Road. The city soccer team won the 2016 championship and archaeologists in 2012 found Richard III’s remains under a parking lot where a 16th-century priory once stood. “Now these are the three highlights,” he said. “Being locked down again attaches a stigma to us.” In Leicester (pronounced “Lester,” in case anyone was wondering), recriminations are flying over why local officials were not given centrally held data showing a spike in infections sooner. “We are a very centralized country — probably one of, if not the most, centralized in the democratic world,” Sir Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, said in an interview. “And if it’s all done from the center, they’re missing out on local expertise, and we’re sitting here very frustrated at not being trusted.” Pouncing on an outbreak depends upon testing and tracking cases down to the level of single office buildings and neighborhoods, a strategy that England has struggled to develop. Chief among its problems has been a network of privately run testing sites that for weeks processed tens of thousands of daily tests, without the government sharing detailed results with local officials. Only testing results from public hospitals were being quickly shared. Those blind spots made Mr. Johnson’s decision to reopen England seem hasty to some experts. Leicester’s lockdown was triggered by an infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 people, nearly three times as high as the bar set by Germany. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that the lifting of the national lockdown appeared timed to the easing of the virus in London, and not its more stubborn spread elsewhere. In an internal report on the outbreak, Leicester officials said the government had denied them testing data in recent months on the grounds that “it hadn’t been cleaned.”  Government officials have said the data processing had not yet been automated, causing delays. When Leicester was given citywide test results on June 1 showing an elevated number of new cases, city officials were alarmed. But on a call in the following days with Leicester’s public health director, national health officials denied anything was amiss, the report said. The city’s public health director “was told it was probably ‘a small numbers issue’ and may well go down again in the following week’s data release,” the report said. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said, “At no point did the department or Public Health England seek to downplay the situation in Leicester. In fact, our close monitoring of the outbreak allowed us to take early action, including through extra testing capacity and providing additional data analysis.” Extra testing was not introduced until June 20, Leicester officials said, shortly after the government publicly confirmed an outbreak. With government health officials struggling to pinpoint the hotspot, and deliberating whether to delay future reopenings or ask everyone to stay at home, it took until June 29 for a lockdown to be announced. Even now, Leicester officials said, they were being notified of positive results only in local areas, and not the overall number of tests, preventing them from determining the rate of new infections. The data also have missing or incorrect information about people’s workplaces — as with a reputed eight-year-old health care worker — making it difficult to trace the spread. Government officials have said that Leicester was slow to complete data security forms required to access testing information. The mayor also publicly questioned the lockdown shortly before it was announced, saying that he was “deeply skeptical” of what it would achieve. On a recent gloomy day, with rain threatening from a leaden sky and shops sitting empty behind closure notices, the city looked ghostly. Pubs and restaurants once poised to open along with those elsewhere in England were shuttered, and boxes of supplies sat stacked on tables. At Sugar and Ice, a cake shop that had reopened in mid-June only to partly close again because of the lockdown, Debbie Bass, the owner, tallied her looming losses. Forty kilograms of buttercream was nearing its expiration date. So was £200, or $250, of sponge cake bases. Three cake orders had already been postponed or canceled. And an employee whom Ms. Bass had rehired off furlough had been sent home. “Now she’s back on furlough and we go through it all over again,” Ms. Bass said. “It’s rather a waste of money and a waste of time.” Adding to the stress for residents was confusion over the lockdown borders. Even the mayor said on the day the lockdown started that he did not know where it applied. “Sitting up all night refreshing social media to see if we had any updates wasn’t very good,” Ms. Bass said. With caution tape still fluttering from the bars of playground equipment, some of the heaviest activity in Leicester was centered last week in the garment factories that analysts fear could have seeded the outbreak. The so-called dark factories — housed in the shells of old buildings, their windows often papered over inside — pay workers as little as £3.50, or $4.40, an hour, a fraction of the national living wage. Their biggest buyers are cheap online retailers like Boohoo, which thrived in the pandemic by switching to leisure wear. The factories — exempt, like other manufacturers, from lockdown — forced workers to show up sick, workers told an advocacy group, Labour Behind the Label. At one 80-person factory, a fifth of the staff had the virus. Labor unions have criticized the government’s Health and Safety Executive, which had been promised an extra £14 million to enforce workplace safety during the pandemic, for not inspecting factories and other facilities more aggressively. “It’s almost like an open secret,” said Dominique Muller of Labour Behind the Label, referring to the longstanding labor abuses. “But there hasn’t been any coherent response from the government.” The high rate of infection in nearby South Asian neighborhoods fed a false perception that nonwhite residents were to blame for the outbreak, spawning racist remarks online. For a city with a long history of immigrant arrivals, the racism has stung. “People are labeling the whole Asian community,” said Priti Raichura, who runs a wedding business in the city. “I have seen lots of racist comments.” Like many places walloped by the coronavirus, Leicester is a deeply unequal city: The gap in life expectancy between the healthiest and sickest neighborhoods is more than six years. The prevalence of diabetes is among the highest in England and rising. But rather than supply public health teams and local doctors with infection data they could have used to warn patients, the government left them in the dark, said Professor Kamlesh Khunti of the University of Leicester, who is also a general practitioner. “We know the family structures better than most,” he said. “Like others, we suffered all these months, but now we have to wait before we can get back to something the rest of the country already has, which seems unfair.”']","When the city of Leicester was shocked with a second lockdown, it lashed back with anger and recriminations."
"China’s Leash on Hong Kong Tightens, Choking a Broadcaster",2020-07-08,By Austin Ramzy and Ezra Cheung,"['HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s public broadcaster has long been a rare example of a government-funded news organization operating on Chinese soil that fearlessly attempts to hold officials accountable. The broadcaster, Radio Television Hong Kong, dug into security footage last year to show how the police failed to respond when a mob attacked protesters in a train station, leading to widespread criticism of the authorities. The broadcaster also produced a three-part documentary on China’s crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang. One RTHK journalist, Nabela Qoser, became famous in Hong Kong for her persistent questioning of top officials. Now, RTHK’s journalists and hard-hitting investigations appear vulnerable to China’s new national security law, which takes aim at dissent and could rein in the city’s largely freewheeling news organizations. The broadcaster, modeled on the British Broadcasting Corporation, has already been feeling pressure. RTHK has drawn fire in recent months from the police, establishment lawmakers and pro-Beijing activists. Its critics have filed thousands of complaints accusing the broadcaster of bias against the government and regularly protest outside its studios. “If you want to enjoy freedom, you have obligations to follow,” said Innes Tang, the chairman of Politihk Social Strategic, a nonprofit pro-Beijing group that has organized protests and petitions against RTHK. “You cannot use fake news to attack people. That is not part of freedom of expression.” As the objections mounted, RTHK was forced to suspend a satirical program that made fun of the police. It was criticized by the Hong Kong government for asking the World Health Organization if Taiwan could join the global health body from which Beijing has shut it out. The broadcaster faces a formal government review into its operations starting next week.  The sweeping national security law China imposed last week on Hong Kong is directed at quelling the pro-democracy protest movement that roiled the territory last year, but it also calls for tougher regulation of the media. The worry is that the law would be used to muzzle outlets by requiring publishers and broadcasters to avoid content and discussions that could be seen by the authorities as subversive. The worst-case fear is that RTHK, as a government department, could be forced to become an organ of state propaganda. The city’s news outlets have faced an onslaught. Reporters covering protests have been pepper-sprayed and detained by the police. Jimmy Lai, the publisher of the Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper, was one of several opposition figures arrested early this year, and state media have accused him of fomenting unrest. Pro-Beijing lawmakers have urged the government to register journalists. The new security law also calls for a group of government bodies, including the national security office, to oversee foreign journalists, raising concerns about the erosion of press freedoms. A reporter asked Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, at a briefing on Tuesday if she would guarantee that journalists in the city would be free to report with the new law in place. Mrs. Lam responded that if “all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100 percent guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same.” Yuen Chan, a senior lecturer of journalism at City, University of London who worked for RTHK in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said the broadcaster was in an “extremely perilous situation” because its status as a government department made it easier for Beijing to exert control. The news organization appears to be taking pre-emptive steps to avoid falling afoul of the security law. In recent weeks, several RTHK journalists say, editors have told reporters not to emphasize pro-independence slogans in their news reports. An RTHK spokeswoman, Amen Ng, said that RTHK journalists “have been doing their job professionally” but added that the broadcaster was not a “platform to promote Hong Kong independence.” But there were already signs in RTHK’s newsroom that a chill was setting in. Kirindi Chan, a top RTHK executive, announced unexpectedly in June that she would resign, citing health reasons. Days later, she met with RTHK reporters who pressed her if she was being forced out over their coverage of the antigovernment demonstrations. Ms. Chan denied being ousted, but she sought to deliver some solemn advice. Ms. Chan reminded the reporters and producers of their role as civil servants, and urged them to comply with the government’s code of conduct, according to two people who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal matter. She did not go into details, but the civil service code calls for impartiality and loyalty to the government, values the authorities have stressed to discourage government employees from joining the protests. Over an RTHK career of nearly three decades, Ms. Chan earned the respect of her staff for being a staunch defender of the organization’s editorial independence. At the end of the somber half-hour meeting, the reporters gave Ms. Chan a bouquet of red and yellow tulips, but an employees’ union said her departure was an ominous sign. “We worry that Ms. Chan’s resignation would set the scene for further attacks on RTHK,” the union said in a statement. RTHK has also found itself caught in geopolitical wrangling between China and Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. In April, the government criticized RTHK over an interview the broadcaster ran with a World Health Organization official, Dr. Bruce Aylward, who was asked whether Taiwan should be allowed to participate in the health body. Taiwan had been shut out by Beijing in recent years. In an awkward exchange that highlighted the sensitivity of the topic, Dr. Aylward first said he did not hear the question, then asked to move on. When the reporter repeated it, the line went dead; minutes later, asked again, Dr. Aylward replied, “We’ve already talked about China.” The interaction gave further ammunition to critics who say the health body is unduly beholden to Beijing. Edward Yau, the Hong Kong secretary for commerce and economic development, which supervises RTHK, accused the broadcaster of having breached China’s official stance toward Taiwan. Such a rebuke now carries more significance against the backdrop of the security law, which focuses heavily on perceived threats to China’s sovereignty. If RTHK were forced to adopt a new role as a broadcaster that serves as the voice of the government, it would be the culmination of a decades-long campaign by its pro-Beijing critics. RTHK was founded as a government radio station in 1928, when Hong Kong was a British colony, and broadcast official bulletins for half a century before it set up its own newsroom in 1973. Not long after the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997, pro-Beijing politicians started urging RTHK to fall in line with the central government. Editorial independence is enshrined in RTHK’s charter. But unlike the United States or Britain, where public broadcasting is given greater autonomy from the government through nonprofit corporations, RTHK is a government department, which makes it far more vulnerable to official intervention. The government flexed its grip over RTHK most overtly in May when it complained about “Headliner,” a satirical program that had taken pointed jabs at the police. That prompted the broadcaster to apologize and suspend the show, a decision that caused some alarm within the organization. “If those who are in power cannot tolerate ‘Headliner,’ then their intolerance will extend to other current affairs programs,” said Gladys Chiu, the chairwoman of RTHK’s labor union. On a recent Wednesday, the staff of “Headliner” gathered in RTHK’s aging studio for a final shoot.

Japan’s Deadly Combination: Climate Change and an Aging Society,2020-07-09,"By Motoko Rich, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno","['TOKYO — The forecast was dire: close to nine inches of rain in a single day. Officials in Kuma, a village on the banks of a fast-moving river in southwestern Japan, urged everyone to evacuate. Yet inside the Senjuen nursing home, the 70 residents were left in place. The decision proved disastrous. The rain that fell early Saturday was even worse than expected, a blinding downpour that soon inundated the village’s streets. Caretakers in the nursing home, which lacked an elevator, struggled to move residents to the second floor. For 14 of them, it was too late — the river breached its banks, killing them in its floodwaters. The events at the nursing home were the deadliest in a week of floods and landslides that have killed 62 people in Kyushu, Japan’s southwesternmost main island. They represent a collision of two powerful forces shaping the country’s present and future: demographic change and global warming. In recent years, climate change has spurred more torrential rains in Japan, causing deadly flooding and mudslides in a nation with many rivers and mountains. The people most vulnerable to the risks of this extreme weather are the elderly, of which Japan has the highest proportion in the world. Nursing homes, especially those with small, overtaxed staffs, face particular challenges because of how difficult it can be to evacuate aging, frail people in the midst of disaster. The rains this week, which have killed mostly people over age 65, flooded more than 50 nursing homes in Kyushu, where Japan’s Meteorological Agency ordered more than a million people within Kumamoto and Kagoshima Prefectures to evacuate. Two years ago, when flooding and landslides killed 237 people across 14 prefectures in western Japan, about three-fifths were over 65. “Now that Japan is getting older and older and the intensity of rainfall is increasing year by year,” said Kenichi Tsukahara, a professor in the disaster risk reduction research center at Kyushu University, “we have double difficulties.” This year, the coronavirus pandemic is adding an extra layer of complexity. As people evacuate to gyms and other community centers, social distancing can be difficult. The elderly are again more vulnerable: The virus kills older people at a far higher rate. Of the 981 people who have died from the coronavirus in Japan, more than 80 percent were 70 or older. Fears of the virus may discourage older residents from leaving their homes, even when it is dangerous to stay. And if they do go to evacuation centers, they could be at risk for heatstroke — especially at sites with poor air conditioning — because of the need to wear masks. It could create “a very tough situation for people to be able to breathe comfortably during heat waves,” said Hisashi Nakamura, a professor at the climate science laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Although the Japanese gird every June and July for the rainy season — known as tsuyu — this year the rainfall has set records in Kyushu, with more rain expected to blanket central Japan by the end of this week. Older residents accustomed to year after year of summer rains may believe they know how to ride out the downpours at home. Yet they may not understand the growing severity of the rains or the increased dangers of flooding. “Under the emerging impact of global warming, there is an increasing risk or potential that rainfall amounts could be at a level that we haven’t experienced in the past,” Professor Nakamura said. “So I think that citizens must realize that their previous experience may no longer work. We have to act even earlier or faster than what we have experienced in the past.” Evacuation itself can pose a risk to the elderly. Conditions in evacuation centers inevitably fall short of those in nursing homes designed for old-age care. For the frailest patients, the moves can cause injury or destabilize long-term care plans. Facility operators have mixed feelings about evacuations, said Hajime Kagiya, a professor of disaster management at Atomi University in Tokyo. “They have to be mindful of the health conditions of the residents as well as choosing a place to evacuate to,” he said. “So they tend to take their time in making the decision to evacuate.” The Japanese government issues standardized evacuation protocols, but they do not take into account the unique characteristics or terrain in different parts of the country, said Professor Tsukahara of Kyushu University. In rural areas, many small villages are isolated and populated by mostly aging residents, with few local resources to help with disaster planning or, in the event of a crisis, to assist with evacuation or rescue. In the case of the Senjuen nursing home, Aki Goto, its director, told The Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, a local newspaper, that she had been more concerned about mudslides than flooding. When the waters came, she added, the caregivers could not move quickly enough to move all the residents upstairs. Six of the workers were on call the night of the floods last weekend, the newspaper reported. That still left each caregiver in charge of more than 10 aging residents, some of whom were unable to walk without help. Even with the aid of local volunteers, they could not bring everyone to safety upstairs as the floodwaters rapidly rose and deluged the ground floor. According to Shigemitsu Sakoda, 53, the president of Land Earth, a local rafting and outdoor sports company who assisted with the rescue effort at Senjuen, only the caretakers and two local volunteer firefighters were moving residents when Mr. Sakoda arrived to help around noon on Saturday. “It’s a really tough job for such a small number of people to carry up those who cannot walk to the second floor,” Mr. Sakoda said in a telephone interview. By the time troops from the Japan Self-Defense Forces arrived to rescue the nursing home residents from the roof, some had already died below. Three years ago, the Japanese government revised a law that requires nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for the disabled and schools located in flood zones to develop evacuation plans and conduct regular drills. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, just over a third of the country’s 68,000 facilities had evacuation plans on record by March of last year. The importance of these efforts was illustrated last fall when Typhoon Hagibis, a record-breaking storm, slammed into the greater Tokyo area. As a power outage rendered elevators inoperable at a nursing home in Kawagoe, in the exurban prefecture of Saitama, 24 caregivers who had rigorously planned and drilled were able to move all 120 residents to the second floor in the middle of the night. The following day, all of the residents — most in their 80s and 90s and many suffering from dementia — were rescued by local firefighters, prefectural police officers and national Self-Defense Forces troops. Some disaster experts say that too often, local municipalities are left to handle evacuations without much help from the national government until a dramatic rescue operation is required. “These floods are not one-off ‘black swan’ events that could not be anticipated,” said Kyle Cleveland, a professor of sociology at the Tokyo campus of Temple University who has studied the Japanese government response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. “Despite having highly trained staff, world-class equipment and well-established emergency response plans,” he added, “when things go sideways, this lack of coordination between state, prefectural and local authorities inordinately delays the response, leaving vulnerable citizens unnecessarily exposed to harm.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe initially dispatched about 10,000 Self-Defense Forces troops to Kyushu over the weekend. Earlier this week, he doubled the number to 20,000, along with 60,000 police officers, firefighters and Coast Guard rescue workers. With the ferocity of floods and landslides intensifying in Japan, some experts suggested that nursing homes and other facilities that cater to the elderly may simply have to move. The Senjuen home in Kuma, for example, “is located in a hazardous area,” said Dr. Kagiya of Atomi University. Given the speed and quantity of rainfall, he said, “it would be very difficult to evacuate no matter how much they struggled.” “When we have victims from disasters, multiple unlucky factors are involved,” he said. “This time that was the case, too. The best solution is to relocate to a safer area.” Hikari Hida contributed reporting.']","Record-breaking rains this week in the country’s southernmost main island, which have killed 62, have shown the vulnerability of people living in nursing homes."
NASA Scientist Jailed in Turkey for 3 Years Recounts His Ordeal,2020-07-09,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — When Turkish police officers stopped him as he set out for the airport to return to the United States after a family vacation in Turkey, the country of his birth, Serkan Golge, a NASA scientist and American citizen, was in disbelief. It was July 2016, eight anxious days after a failed coup tried to unseat President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the police told Mr. Golge that they had received an anonymous tip that he worked for the C.I.A. and was part of a terrorist group accused of masterminding the plot. The idea was so far-fetched that Mr. Golge expected to sort it out quickly and changed his flight to the next day. “I was quite shocked, but I was like, ‘This will go away,’” he said. “This is probably a mistake and the police and prosecutors would figure this out.” It would take four years. Mr. Golge and his family returned to Houston just last week, ending a nightmare in which he was held for three years in solitary confinement as he became a bargaining chip in a series of high-level disputes between the Turkish and American governments. In his first interview since arriving home, Mr. Golge described with exasperation but little rancor the ordeal of being charged and found guilty of terrorist activities on evidence so flimsy he called it “garbage.” His account provides a rare insight into the Turkish judicial machine from the side of a defendant. Some 70,000 people have been accused in the Turkish courts in connection with the failed coup. Many, still fearful of the whims of Turkish justice, prefer to keep silent even once they are freed. Mr. Erdogan’s government has blamed the coup attempt on Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. Soon after the coup, pro-government Turkish media outlets began accusing the American government of being behind the plot, suggesting that it was in league with Mr. Gulen. For Mr. Golge, who has a doctorate in physics and worked as a senior research scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, being an American citizen was enough to be presumed guilty. “You fit the profile,” he recalled his lawyer telling him at one point. “It does not really matter if you are innocent or not. They won’t release you.” After 14 days, Mr. Golge appeared before a judge who told him the police had found an American dollar bill in his parent’s house, which the Turkish authorities alleged was a badge of membership to the Gulen movement, by then designated a terrorist group. He was held in a general prison in southern Turkey, alongside high-ranking military officers, judges and prosecutors, some of whom told him that they were being held without any evidence at all. Senior military officers and civilian supporters of Mr. Gulen have been charged over their part in leading the coup and ordering the bombing of the Parliament and clashes that killed 250 people. But thousands of others who were accused had only tenuous links to Mr. Gulen’s movement, or, like the military cadets who were ordered out on the night of the coup, had little idea what was going on. Journalists and political opponents of Mr. Erdogan with no connection to the events were prosecuted as well. Mr. Golge was sent to a prison in the town of Iskenderun, where in the August heat 32 men were crammed in a cell made for eight. He slept on a blanket on the floor and soon fell ill with bronchitis. Within a month, he was moved to solitary confinement and faced charges of overthrowing the government and the constitution, which carried a life sentence, and a charge of belonging to a terrorist organization, which carried a 15-year sentence. “‘That’s it, I’m never getting out of here,’” he recalled thinking. “That was a collapse psychologically, and I cried a lot.” “It is a very small room — it barely sees the sunlight, and the guards took me out only one hour a day,” he said. “And I stayed in that room, in that small single cell, for three years.” For a long time, Mr. Golge clung to the fact that the evidence the Turkish prosecutors presented was hardly incriminating. The anonymous tip turned out to be from a relative who bore a grudge against Mr. Golge’s sister and later admitted he did not know if his allegations were true. The prosecutors drew on other evidence, and even Mr. Golge acknowledges that he fits the profile of a possible member of the Gulen movement. He went to Fatih University, which was one of the most prominent Gulen schools, on a scholarship to study physics; he banked with Bank Asya, which was part of the Gulen network of companies. But none of that, he points out, amounts to a crime. “A one dollar bill, an anonymous tip, a bank account? How is this terrorism?” Mr. Golge asked. “Nobody could explain, but I think this is how laws and courts still work in Turkey.” Mr. Golge has condemned the coup attempt and says he had nothing to do with the Gulen movement. “I am not part of this organization,” he said. “I am very sorry for the people who lost their lives. This is something unacceptable. Violence is never a solution. I have always believed in democracy, and I think currently it is the best solution we have.” But he says Turkey missed an opportunity by not dealing justly with the coup attempt. Instead, zealous prosecutors have pursued people far beyond the actual perpetrators, sweeping up many who have been judged guilty by association. Mr. Golge recalls a fellow inmate, a former judge, telling him the government had no evidence against him. “At least there was some bogus evidence about you,” he told Mr. Golge, “but I don’t know why I was arrested.” He shared time in the exercise yard with a one-star general who told him he had opposed the coup but had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment anyway because his name appeared on a list of appointments made by the coup plotters. “If Turkey only prosecuted the responsible people, instead of prosecuting hundreds of thousands of innocent people, I think that Turkish democracy would come out of this horrible act much stronger,” Mr. Golge said. Gradually, with American officials including President Trump pressing Turkey for his release over the lack of evidence, the charges against Mr. Golge were reduced. He was eventually convicted of aiding a terrorist organization, and the sentence was reduced on appeal. He said he sensed the Turkish judges knew the case against him was “garbage” but were compelled to drag out the process. “I felt they were scared of something,” he added. He was released from prison in May 2019 and in April this year was cleared to leave the country. But then he was hospitalized with stomach ulcers, and the coronavirus pandemic grounded flights. The strain of the past four years on his wife, Kubra, and two boys, ages 4 and 10, erupted at the airport, when Mr. Golge was pulled aside at passport control and held for 40 minutes. “My wife started crying, the kids started crying,” he said. “I tried to stay calm because I knew they had no basis to hold me, but they were shaking so hard. My son was crying a lot, grabbing me, holding on to me, saying ‘No Dad, not again, not again.’” Officials at the U.S. Embassy, who were tracking his progress, ensured he made the flight. Back in Houston, he is rebuilding his life, applying for his old job and looking for a house. “Your life — four years, three years in prison — will not come back,” he said. “But that’s life. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win.’’']","Finally home in Houston, Serkan Golge is still dismayed by the “garbage” evidence linking him to a failed coup and says the country is missing a chance to build its democracy."
"London Police Stop Star Athletes, Setting Off Racial Profiling Debate",2020-07-07,By Marc Santora,"['LONDON — The couple, a top British sprinter and a Portuguese track star, were driving their Mercedes through the elegant Maida Vale neighborhood in West London — their 3-month-old son in the back seat — when a police van appeared in their rearview mirror. The athletes, Bianca Williams, 26, and Ricardo dos Santos, 25, soon found themselves surrounded by officers before being hustled from their vehicle and placed in handcuffs as the police searched the car. Ms. Williams, a European and Commonwealth gold medalist in the 4x100-meter relay, accused the London Metropolitan Police of racial profiling, saying her family was targeted because they are Black and drive an expensive car. The police said in a statement that they had pulled over the car because officers “witnessed a vehicle with blacked-out windows that was driving suspiciously, including driving on the wrong side of the road.” The events, some of which were captured on shaky cellphone video and posted on social media, have renewed debate over police tactics in England at a moment of heightened awareness over institutional racism. In a series of interviews with British news outlets over the past three days, Ms. Williams disputed the police account, noting that she and her partner were driving on a single-lane road and were looking for a safe place to pull over. (It is common practice in Britain for drivers to park on either side of a residential street.) Ms. Williams said that the aggressiveness of the officers so unnerved her that she was scared to get out of the car. “My partner got dragged out of the car, they handcuffed him straight away and pinned him up against the wall,” Ms. Williams told the BBC. “I didn’t want to be separated from my 3-month-old son, and they then put me in handcuffs straight away too.” They were kept cuffed for about 45 minutes as the police searched the car, then were eventually released. “It’s a really sad world that we live in and if it’s not one Black man, it’s another Black man,” Ms. Williams said. “My heart just hurts.” A video of a brief part of the encounter was posted on Twitter by Linford Christie, an Olympic gold medalist who trained both Ms. Williams and Mr. Dos Santos, a Portuguese sprinter. “Racist police aren’t just in America,” he wrote in a post that quickly went viral. In the video, a woman can be heard pleading with officers that her child was in the car and that she did not want to be separated from him. In another video clip of the encounter, a female officer can be heard telling the woman to calm down and that no one wanted to harm her or her child. The police said in a statement that they had reviewed “footage from social media, and the body-worn video of the officers, and are satisfied that there is no concern around the officers’ conduct.” The local police commander in central-west London, Helen Harper, said in a statement that the police wanted to speak to the couple to better understand their concerns. “We want to listen to, and speak with, those who raise concerns, to understand more about the issues raised and what more we can do to explain police actions,” Ms. Harper said. “Where we could have interacted in a better way, we need to consider what we should have done differently and take on that learning for the future.” The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, told LBC radio that it was hard to see what justification there could have been for handcuffing the couple. “I don’t know what led to the stop in the first place,” he said. “But what I do know is that if I was a senior officer looking at that video footage, I would feel uncomfortable about the way that it was dealt with.” The British police have long employed “stop and search” tactics, long the subject of often bitter debate. Stops reached a peak in 2009, when the police searched about 1.5 million people or vehicles based on “reasonable grounds” of suspicion of possession of illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something that could be used to commit a crime. After dropping steadily for years, the stops increased 50 percent in London during the coronavirus lockdown, with 30,608 stops this past April compared to 20,981 over the same period in 2019. In June, as protests over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis spread around the world, many Britons pointed to the disproportionate number of searches in areas with large Black, Asian and minority ethnic populations as evidence of a systemic problem. According to official statistics, Black people are 10 times as likely to be stopped and searched than white people are.']","Bianca Williams, a European gold medalist, accused the officers of targeting her and her partner, a fellow sprinter, because they are Black and drive an expensive car."
Australia Halts Hong Kong Extradition Agreement and Extends Visas,2020-07-09,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — Australia will suspend its extradition agreement with Hong Kong because of the new national security law imposed by China and extend temporary visas for Hong Kongers in the country, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday. The announcement, which came on the heels of Canada’s suspension of its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and Britain’s statement that it was considering a similar move, threatened to deepen the diplomatic tensions between Canberra and Beijing. Mr. Morrison said Australia’s visa extension for people from Hong Kong who are already in the country would allow them to stay for an additional five years and open a path to permanent residency. He also suggested businesses should move from Hong Kong to his country, declaring, “We are a great immigration nation.” Australia also updated its advice to citizens about traveling to Hong Kong, citing questions about the interpretation of the security law and the risk of Australians being sent to mainland China for prosecution. “You may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds,” Australia’s travel advice states. “You could break the law without intending to.” The announcements were the latest in a series of moves by countries in response to a law that has drastically increased the role of Beijing’s security services in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous former British colony that returned to China in 1997. It raised fears that Beijing would curb free speech, the ability to assemble and other rights that have traditionally been better protected in Hong Kong than in mainland China. Mr. Morrison said Australia’s decisions were in response to the potentially sweeping effects of the new security law imposed on Hong Kong. “Our government, together with other governments around the world, have been very consistent in expressing our concerns about the imposition of the national security law on Hong Kong,” Mr. Morrison said. “Today we have agreed to announce that that national security law constitutes a fundamental change of circumstances in respect to our extradition agreement with Hong Kong.” He said that the government was not expecting large numbers of new applications from Hong Kong, and the application and approval processes would remain unchanged. Australia’s move is not as sweeping as Britain’s decision to open a path to citizenship for as many as three million Hong Kongers. But the announcement reflected global concern about China’s new law for the territory. New Zealand’s government also said on Thursday that it would review the country’s relationship with Hong Kong. “China’s decision to pass a new national security law for Hong Kong has fundamentally changed the environment for international engagement there,” said Winston Peters, the country’s deputy prime minister who also handles foreign affairs. Taiwan, where several participants in Hong Kong’s protest movement have fled over the past year, has also established an office to help Hong Kongers. The Chinese Embassy in Canberra denounced Australia’s move over Hong Kong. “We urge the Australian side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs,” it said in a statement, adding, “Otherwise it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet.” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Australia’s announcements “seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.” China “reserves the right to respond further,” he added, without offering specifics. But Hong Kongers in Australia welcomed Mr. Morrison’s move. “Hong Kong is facing something hopeless and dreadful,” said Sunny Cheng, a representative for the Association of Hong Kongers in Western Australia. “We are really grateful that Australia offers a helping hand in this really difficult period of time.” Extending incentives for Hong Kong businesses to establish themselves in Australia would help rebuild Australia’s economy in turn, he added. “We are hardworking. We can help to rebuild,” Mr. Cheng said. Isabella Kwai contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia.

‘Maybe I Shouldn’t Have Come’: U.S. Visa Changes Leave Students in Limbo,2020-07-09,By Megan Specia and Maria Abi-Habib,"['LONDON — Oliver Philcox was nearing the end of his first year of graduate studies in astrophysics at Princeton University when the coronavirus outbreak began. Classes were halted in March, and then moved online. By May, he had decided to travel home to Britain. “In the long run, that was a terrible idea,” said Mr. Philcox, 24. “But I had assumed I would be able to go back in September.” Now, the return to an American institution has been thrown into question for Mr. Philcox and countless other international students after a directive by the Trump administration that students whose classes were moving entirely online for the fall would be stripped of their visas and required to leave the United States. Many universities see the move as a political one — an attempt to pressure them to reopen rather than hosting all classes online during the pandemic. For some international students, the directive poses frustrating questions of logistics and uncertainty. But for others — notably those whose home countries are embroiled in conflict or have communications technologies that are insufficient for online learning — the decision has the potential to disrupt their lives and drastically alter their futures. The Trump administration’s plan to require in-person classes for international students would affect around one million students, according to data from the 2019 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange. China sends the highest number of students — with about 370,000 enrolled in American universities in 2018-2019 — followed by India with just over 200,000 students enrolled that year. As the reality has sunk in, outrage has grown from those around the world who are now met with the possibility that they may not be able to return to, or stay in, the United States for their education. Many are rethinking whether the choice to enroll in an American institution, despite the expertise and prestige, was worth it. Macarena Ramos Gonzalez, a native of Spain who is nearing the end of a Ph.D. program in applied physiology at the University of Delaware, was blunt: “If they really don’t want me here — and the administration has made that very clear in a number of ways — maybe I shouldn’t have come.” The decision highlights a wide disconnect between the diversity that most universities strive for among students and staff members and a government that shuns those principles, she said. Hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters have signed petitions demanding that the government rethink the decision and urging their universities to protect students from abroad. Some universities are reassessing their fall reopening policies in an attempt to enable some in-person classes. Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have sued the Trump administration in federal court to block the directive, arguing that the policy is political and will upend higher education in the United States, and other universities have tried to ease students’ fears. But many remain worried. The directive has also caused confusion, as it is unclear whether some universities will even offer in-person classes or whether the restrictions apply to graduate-level research. For some international students, the United States has been a haven, offering safety from conflict in their home countries and relief from infrastructure that cannot support remote learning. But that sense of security has now been upended. In Ifat Gazia’s hometown in Kashmir, India’s government cut off internet access in August as part of moves to strengthen its grip over the disputed territory. Although the service was restored in January, only 2G is available, making it nearly impossible to make calls over Skype, let alone support the video that would be needed if she were to try to attend lectures via Zoom. Ms. Gazia arrived in the United States last August, just as India was cracking down on her region. She was unable to call her parents to let them know she had arrived safely, as the Indian government had cut landline and mobile phone service in Kashmir. “I considered myself lucky when I landed,” Ms. Gazia said. “But when this order came this week, I felt only despair.” She pointed out that higher education is often a pathway for the United States to draw in highly skilled workers. “That is what makes America great,” she said. “But so many Americans think we are just here to just take from their country. They don’t realize how much we contribute.” For students like Kunal Singh, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in political science at M.I.T., there is no way even to get home. He has been unable to fly to India, as it shut its borders in March to stem the spread of coronavirus. The anti-foreigner sentiment has also stripped away some of the prestige of graduating from a top American university. “If I had known that something like this would happen when I was applying to American schools, I wouldn’t have applied,” Mr. Singh said. “I would have applied to Australia or Britain.” For some, it isn’t worth the money or stress to continue. Andres Jaime, 48, whose 19-year-old son is a student at the Berklee School of Music in Boston, said they had decided that he would postpone his studies and return to Colombia. Mr. Jaime said they had previously asked the university to lower fees for the coming semester “because the online experience wasn’t the same,” but the university refused. The visa decision further strengthened their resolve that he should return home. Other students have begun assessing other options, like Andy Mao, 21, from Shanghai, who is studying biology at New York University. He was preparing for the Graduate Record Exam when he heard the news. This was his final year in an undergraduate program, and he had planned years of study in the United States because of its legacy as a research leader. But now, he said he would add universities in Canada and Singapore to his list. “I still like this country,” he said. “But if Trump gets re-elected, we will face huge uncertainty.” In many cases, graduate and Ph.D. students have spouses and children with them in the United States, which means that the directive will also result in the uprooting of whole families. In some cases, children will be displaced from the country that they were born in and the only country they have ever known. Among those students is Naette Lee, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in communications at the University of Maryland. Ms. Lee, 38, from Trinidad and Tobago, lives with her husband, who is Belgian, and infant son, who was born in the United States and is an American citizen. They would be unable to travel to Europe together because of a ban on nonresident travelers from the United States. And if Ms. Lee has to return home, she will be separated from her family — Trinidad and Tobago have barred foreigners from entering the country during the pandemic, which would extend to her husband and son. “This is not about the campus experience,” she said. “This is about leaving our lives behind.” Many students are even struggling to understand whether they will be affected by the directive, particularly those studying for advanced degrees that are focused on research. They would typically have no in-person classes and instead study independently. Kelsey Bryk, 29, a Canadian, left the University of Delaware in a scramble in March, driving 26 hours to her home in Winnipeg as border closings loomed. Having spent the last four years working toward a Ph.D., she may now not be able to return. “I’ve invested so much time money and effort, and now it’s just being potentially ripped away,” she said. While her university is still trying to figure out a way to ensure that international students can stay, the uncertainty looms. “Right now, I don’t think anyone has any answers,” she said. “And we are just sitting here expecting the worst and hoping for the best.” Megan Specia reported from London, and Maria Abi Habib from Los Angeles. Karan Deep Singh contributed reporting from New Delhi, Cao Li from Hong Kong and Elian Peltier and Iliana Magra from London.']",The return to studying at an American institution has been thrown into question for an estimated one million international students.
‘A Colossal Error’: Mexican Leader Under Fire for Plan to Visit Trump,2020-07-07,By Natalie Kitroeff,"['MEXICO CITY — The risks could be enormous, but they haven’t swayed President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico. Mexican diplomats and opposition figures have warned Mr. López Obrador against traveling to Washington this week to thank President Trump and celebrate the beginning of a new trade deal between the two countries and Canada. The visit, they have said, was an incomprehensible choice in the middle of a pandemic and global economic crisis, coming with the risk of public humiliation at the hands of Mr. Trump, who has called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “animals” and has said that Mexico is “not our friend.” Still, Mr. López Obrador said he would move ahead with plans to fly to Washington and greet Mr. Trump on Wednesday. “President Trump’s discourse regarding Mexico has been more respectful than it was previously, for which we are very grateful,” Mr. López Obrador said in a recent news conference. “I am also going to give thanks for the U.S. government’s respectful treatment of us.” Bernardo Sepúlveda, a former foreign minister, wrote in an open letter to the government that the trip would “negatively affect national interests” in the long term, noting that Mr. Trump has been “stigmatizing, offending and humiliating Mexican immigrants.” The visit could also alienate the Democratic Party in the run up to the November elections. Mr. López Obrador does not plan to meet with Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada declined the invitation to attend the summit, citing scheduling conflicts. Some Mexican politicians and pundits view the trip as a capitulation to a leader who has routinely disparaged the country and undermined its interests. Jorge Castañeda, another former foreign minister, said the visit would not yield many benefits for Mexico and that “Trump is using López Obrador for his own political ends.” And Arturo Sarukhán, former Mexican ambassador to the United States, called the trip “a colossal error, electorally, diplomatically and strategically.” But the roasting has not deterred Mr. López Obrador, long a divisive figure in Mexican politics. He has insisted that there is more to gain from the visit than his critics will admit. “Mexico needs to have a solid relationship with the United States, no matter who is the president,” said Erick Ordoñez, 29, a supporter of Mr. López Obrador who grew up in Chiapas and now lives in Barcelona. Mr. Ordoñez said the visit could help bring more foreign investment into Mexico and lift the economy. “We need to benefit the Mexican people, with plans for trade, for creating jobs, for U.S. investment into Mexico,” he said. Mr. López Obrador has touted the importance of celebrating the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect last week, at a moment when Mexico is in dire need of an economic revival. Mr. Trump has also done Mexico a few favors of late, sending hundreds of ventilators across the border and agreeing to help the country meet an obligation to cut oil production under a recent international agreement. “It’s a big gamble,” said Luis Rubio, the president of the Mexican Council of International Affairs. “If it doesn’t go well, if Trump talks about ‘the wall’ or something in that vein, López Obrador will be embarrassed and will return with his tail between his legs.” The timing of the trip has also been the subject of scrutiny among many in Mexico. The United States is only a few months away from a national election, coronavirus infections are surging on both sides of the border and officials close to both presidents have tested positive for the virus. Adding to the trip’s health risks is Mr. López Obrador’s preferred mode of transportation: In keeping with his image as a frugal public servant, the president plans to fly to Washington on a commercial jet. “You could become infected,” said Valeria Burgos, a small-business owner in Cuernavaca, a city south of Mexico’s capital. “This is not the moment for heads of state to be leaving their countries.” But Ms. Burgos, 27, acknowledged that there might never be an ideal moment for a Mexican president to meet with Mr. Trump. During the U.S. elections in 2016, there was a similar uproar over the former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto’s decision to host Mr. Trump at Los Pinos, the Mexican White House. “That was a total disaster and an insult to Mexicans,” Ms. Burgos said. “And that was in our country. Imagine how it will be when our president goes to Trump’s country.” Mr. López Obrador won the presidency in 2018 with the largest margin of victory in more than a decade, but his popularity has slipped in recent months as concerns over his handling of the pandemic have grown. Still, the Mexican president enjoys the approval of close to 60 percent of the population and a very loyal base. “For Mexico, it’s very politically important that Andrés Manuel is close to the United States,” said José Paniagua, a longtime supporter of Mr. López Obrador who lives in Mexico City. “This is a country that always has and always will be our neighbor,” Mr. Paniagua said. “If the presidents didn’t meet it would hurt us both more, because in the end, Mexico and the United States will always be together.”']","President Andrés Manuel López Obrador will meet in the White House this week with President Trump, and he said he planned to praise the administration for its “respectful treatment” of Mexicans."
South Korean Triathlete’s Suicide Exposes Team’s Culture of Abuse,2020-07-09,By Choe Sang-Hun,"[""SEOUL, South Korea — Just after midnight on June 26, Choi Suk-hyeon, a promising South Korean triathlete, sent two text messages. The first, to a teammate, asked for help looking after her pet dog. The other, to her mother, was more ominous. In that message Ms. Choi, 22, told her mother how much she loved her, before adding: “Mom, please make the world know the crimes they have committed.” To her parents and former teammates, it was clear who she meant by “they.” After Ms. Choi committed suicide, her family released a spiral-bound diary and secret recordings in which the young triathlete documented years of physical and psychological abuse she said she suffered at the hands of her team’s coach, doctor and two senior teammates. In one recording, the team’s doctor, Ahn Ju-hyeon, can be heard repeatedly hitting her. “Lock your jaws! Come here!” Mr. Ahn is heard saying in the March 2019 recording, followed by a series of thudding strikes. The diaries and recordings, which were reviewed by The New York Times, have set off a firestorm of criticism and national soul searching about the corruption and abuse that has long pervaded the country’s sports community. On Monday, the Korea Triathlon Federation banned the coach, Kim Gyu-bong, and \u200bthe team captain, Jang Yun-jeong, from the sport\u200b for life\u200b. Prosecutors were also preparing criminal charges against them, as well as Mr. Ahn. Mr. Ahn, who was referred to as a doctor, but reportedly does not hold a medical degree, did not answer calls or respond to messages seeking comment and has made no public comments about the case. During a parliamentary hearing on Monday, Mr. Kim, Ms. Jang and Kim Do-hwan, another athlete accused of bullying Ms. Choi, all denied the accusations. South Korea has taken pride in its growing prowess as a global sports powerhouse, with its top athletes winning Olympic gold medals and other prizes. But recurring scandals have revealed widespread physical violence, sexual assault and other forms of abuse against athletes, many of whom are young, vulnerable and live away from their families during training. Young athletes live together in dormitories and routinely skip classes to attend practices, leaving them with few career choices outside of sports. Such a system gives coaches exceptional power over athletes, and other victims have said they were afraid to earlier speak up for fear they would be left without careers, and ostracized by their teammates. In a rare example of a Korean athlete speaking out, Shim Suk-hee, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in short-track speedskating, shocked the country last year by accusing her former coach of raping her repeatedly since she was 17. The coach, Cho Jae-beom, was sentenced to 10 months in prison for physically assaulting four athletes, including Ms. Shim, between 2011 and the preparations for the 2018 Winter Olympics held in Pyeongchang, South Korea. He is still fighting the rape charges in court. The Korean cases are part of a larger global trend in which female athletes are speaking out about physical, emotional and sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches and team doctors. In the United States, Larry Nassar, a doctor, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for molesting scores of girls, many of them Olympic gymnasts, under the guise of giving them examinations. While it is hard to fully understand her mind-set, Ms. Choi, 22, had sought help, filing complaints and petitions with the authorities. In the months leading up to her suicide, she had reported her case to the National Human Rights Commission, the Korea Triathlon Federation, the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee, and the police in Gyeongju City, where the team was based. Ms. Choi told the authorities, in complaints reviewed by The Times, that Mr. Ahn had slapped, punched and kicked her more than 20 times on the day she made the recording, and fractured one of her ribs. She said she did not seek medical treatment at the time for fear of retaliation. “She had been stressed out lately because the officials she appealed to acted as if some beating and abuse should be taken for granted in the sport,” said Ms. Choi's father, Choi Young-hee. The authorities, he said, told Ms. Choi “that the accused denied any wrongdoing and that they didn’t have enough evidence to act, even though \u200bwe gave them the audio files.” “Our country may have advanced \u200ba \u200blot in other sectors, but the human rights in our sports remain stuck in the 1970s and ’80s,” \u200bsaid Mr. Choi\u200b, a farmer. “Who is going to bring back my daughter alive?” In a diary she began keeping last year, Ms. Choi extensively described beating, bullying and other abuse. “I wish I were dead,” Ms. Choi wrote last July. “I wish that I were run over by a car while walking on the street or stabbed to death by a robber while asleep.” Ms. Choi wondered whether she was “insane” or “paranoid,” as she said her abusers called her. Ms. Choi later told the authorities that she was beaten by the doctor in March 2019 during a training trip to New Zealand as punishment for eating a peach despite her coach’s order to lose weight. In the audio recording from that day, Ms. Choi sniffled and begged for mercy, repeatedly saying, “I am sorry, sir.” “Mr. Team Doctor is beating you for your own good,” the coach, Kim Gyu-bong, told Ms. Choi. “Stop whining!” he said. “Or I will beat you dead myself!” \u200bMs. Choi, a child swimming prodigy, was selected in 2015 for the junior national triathlon team and earned three gold medals. After graduating from high school in 2017, she joined the elite triathlon team in Gyeongju. The bullying, hazing and gaslighting began when Ms. Choi, then still a high school student, was allowed to train with the adult \u200bteam in \u200bGyeongju\u200b, she said in her complaints. Ms. Choi said that much of the verbal abuse was led by Ms. Jang, the team’s star athlete and a national champion. In her statements to the authorities, Ms. Choi said Ms. Jang “struck my head, pushed and punched me and repeatedly called me names.” She said Ms. Jang humiliated her in front of other teammates by calling her sexually promiscuous. In one instance, Ms. Choi said, the team’s coach forced her to kneel in front of Ms. Jang. She cited Ms. Jang’s bullying as one of the main reasons she left the team for a year to seek medical help. \u200bWhile training in New Zealand in 2016, Ms. Choi later told the authorities, her coach slapped her with a shoe. That same year, the coach and team doctor \u200bforced Ms. Choi and another athlete to eat $168 worth of bread. They were made to eat and vomit and eat again until early in the morning, Ms. Choi said. Ms. Choi was chosen for the national team in 2018, but took the year off to receive medical counseling. “I am back in New Zealand and this is a new start!” she wrote in her diary in January 2019 after rejoining the team for its annual training season there. “I can make a fantastic comeback! I can do it! Let’s go!” But the abuse resumed. “We basically like you. All the coaching staff cheer for you, but you cheated us,” the team doctor, \u200bMr. Ahn, was recorded telling Ms. Choi. He indicated that he was punishing her because she had complained about the beatings to outsiders. In one recording from Ms. Choi’s smartphone, her coach, Mr. Kim, can be heard hitting her once. In another, he calls her “psychotic” and orders her not to eat for three days to avoid gaining weight. This year, Ms. Choi left Gyeongju for another team, and began filing complaints against her former teammates, coach and doctor. Her coach, as well as Ms. Jang and Kim Do-hwan, another athlete accused of bullying Ms. Choi, did not respond to messages seeking comment and the team has not released a statement on their behalf. It was unknown if any of the three had already obtained legal counsel. It was also unknown if Mr. Ahn, the team doctor, was represented by a lawyer.  In addition to looking into the abuse claims, prosecutors have also opened an investigation into money the coaching staff and Ms. Jang \u200bregularly collected from \u200b team members in the name of covering air travel\u200b, “psychological therapy” and other expenses, although the team was financed by Gyeongju City. Ms. Choi’s family alone wired more than $23,000 to them. After Ms. Choi’s suicide, several former teammates came forward to corroborate her allegations and share stories of their own abuse, according to Lee Yong, a former coach of South Korea’s Olympic bobsled and skeleton team, who is now an opposition lawmaker. In a news conference on Monday, two former teammates of Ms. Choi said the team was a “kingdom” ruled by the coach, Mr. Kim, and his star athlete, Ms. Jang. The women said they were beaten 10 days per month and verbal abuse was common. \u200bThe two athletes who spoke at the news conference on Monday said Mr. Ahn had touched \u200btheir breasts and thighs in the name of physical therapy. The news media in South Korea granted the two athletes anonymity ahead of the news conference. “We joined the Gyeongju team fresh out of high school\u200b. Although we dreaded the oppression and violence of the coach and the captain, everyone hushed \u200bthe matter,” one of the women said. “We thought this was the life we had to \u200bendure as athletes.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.""]","After Choi Suk-hyeon’s death, her family released secret audio recordings that depict the physical and psychological abuse she appeared to suffer at the hands of her team’s doctor and coach."
"Over 180 Bodies Found Dumped in Burkina Faso Town, Report Says",2020-07-08,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — The bodies of at least 180 men thought to have been killed by security forces have been found dumped in fields, by roadsides and under bridges in a town in the West African country of Burkina Faso over the past eight months, witnesses told human rights researchers. Residents of the town, Djibo, in the north of the country, said many of the bodies were found shot and blindfolded, their hands bound. Many said they recognized relatives among the dead. The testimony is contained in a new report by the New York-based group Human Rights Watch and matches the accounts of several witnesses interviewed for a recent investigation by The New York Times into extrajudicial killings by Burkina Faso’s security forces. Terrorists, government security forces and bandits have killed thousands of people in the country in the past four years, plunging what was a peaceful nation into conflict and chaos. Nearly a million people have fled. Residents said the men killed were mostly members of the Fulani ethnic group, which has been targeted for recruitment by terrorist organizations, and, therefore, for reprisals by government forces. Djibo is a Fulani-majority town founded in the 16th century, and it has long been home to the country’s biggest cattle market. One young resident of Djibo said in an interview with the Times in March that he often saw corpses on his way to the bus. An animal trader said in another interview that he had stopped buying cows in Djibo because seeing the bodies terrified him. Neither wanted to be named for fear of reprisals. A spokesman for the Defense Ministry declined to comment, and referred to a statement by the defense minister, Chérif Sy, issued to Human Rights Watch. Mr. Sy said in the statement that the allegations would be investigated. He also said that those responsible for the killings might not be soldiers, but terrorists disguised in army uniforms. “They are experts when it comes to sowing confusion, and seeming like members of the armed forces to the population,” he wrote. But Djibo is openly controlled and patrolled by the military, so it is unlikely that terrorist groups would be able to operate there. Several residents told researchers that they saw soldiers arrest men who turned up dead in Djibo a few days later. Human remains were first discovered strewn around Djibo’s suburbs starting in November, residents told Human Rights Watch, which has done extensive research on abuses in Burkina Faso. The bodies were not hidden, and residents were too scared to bury them lest they become associated with someone accused of being a terrorist. So the bodies lay where they were dumped. “The bodies stayed there for anywhere from a few days before they were buried, or months, until they just turned into skeletons and were dispersed by the animals,” said Corinne Dufka, Human Rights Watch’s Sahel director. Ms. Dufka called for an investigation and for those responsible to be prosecuted. In recent months, new reports say, government forces have stepped up attacks on civilians in Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, three countries in the Sahel, a long band of arid land south of the Sahara. In Burkina Faso, members of the traditionally nomadic Fulani ethnic group say they bear the brunt of military attacks. Terrorist groups usually recruit from the Fulani community, analysts say, so soldiers target Fulani villages in revenge for attacks on their comrades or because they suspect them of helping the enemy. The 180 killed in Djibo may fit into this pattern. Since they had no trials, there is no evidence they were connected with the terrorists. Most of the dead in Djibo were buried in mass graves in early March, residents said, after they convinced the authorities that the corpses posed a public health hazard. ']","For months, terrified residents of Djibo, a town in the West African nation, kept discovering corpses of men who had been shot, blindfolded and bound. They blame the military."
Couples Separated by Europe’s Travel Bans Fight to Be Reunited,2020-07-08,By Megan Specia,"[""LONDON — Every morning, Marisa Lobato wakes up and checks the news to see if the travel restrictions have changed. She lives in São Paulo, Brazil, and her fiancé, Horst Schlereth, is in Germany. Before the coronavirus put everything on hold, Ms. Lobato had planned to go to Germany this spring to prepare for their wedding. Now their daily calls are filled with fretting over when they will reunite. “We feel completely stuck in this situation,” she said. “I normally don’t cry in front of him, but I cry alone. It’s really a horrible feeling.” The pair are among a number of separated, unmarried couples who have rallied on social media for changes to the European Union’s travel restrictions, using the hashtag #LoveIsNotTourism and #LoveIsEssential. Unlike most married people, they do not have a right to enter the European Union to be reunited with their partners. Now, the European Commission, the bloc's executive branch, is throwing its weight behind the cause, urging member states to exempt unmarried people with partners in Europe from the travel ban. But only Denmark and Sweden have adopted any of the recommendations and couples say even border guards in member states are confused about the regulations. Late last month, the European Union announced plans to reopen travel on July 1 to visitors from 15 countries, in an attempt to salvage the bloc’s peak tourism season. The United States, Brazil and Russia, among other countries, were notably excluded. Some of the countries that are still banned aren’t close to meeting the E.U. requirements for controlling the coronavirus before they can resume travel, and could need weeks, months or more to reach those standards. Ylva Johansson, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, is an outspoken advocate for the separated couples. Her office said there are no official statistics on the number of people affected, but a Facebook support group for couples separated during the pandemic has around 3,000 members. While the commission has recommended that member nations allow unmarried couples to reunite, Ms. Johansson said, it is up to each country to set its own policy. “For me it’s important that you have as broad as possible of a definition of a couple that are really a true couple,” she said. “But the exact definition of that is for the member states to decide.” Many people who want that definition loosened have pointed to the approach that Denmark adopted this month — which allows visitors who can prove they are in durable relationships and test negative for Covid-19 to enter the country — as an example for other nations in the bloc. Several members of the European Parliament have written letters calling on other European leaders to implement more open policies, and dozens signed an open letter to Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister, urging him to recognize unmarried couples. “The family of the 21st century goes beyond the official marriage,” Moritz Körner, a European Parliament member from Germany, wrote to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, in one of several open letters he has sent to European leaders. Until the virus changed everything, Miriam Paffen, who is German, and her partner, Javier, who is Argentine and a resident of Brazil, made trans-Atlantic journeys to spend time together. Their last visit was in December. “We actually have no idea when we can see each other again,” Ms. Paffen said. Ryann McQuaid, an American living in New York, and her partner Hannah Maes, who is Belgian and lives in Brussels, are in a long-term relationship, but for the past year have been long distance. They typically saw each other every three months before lockdowns derailed their plans. They have been frantically calling officials, searching for answers to when — and whether — they can be together again in Brussels. “Everyone we get in touch with will point us to another official,” Ms. McQuaid said. “We’ve never had to sort of justify our relationship in that sense before. So that’s also just been very frustrating.” Border restrictions in countries outside Europe have also split unmarried couples apart during the pandemic. Couples in the United States and Canada have found themselves separated for months by the closure of their countries’ shared border. A visa delay has prevented Morgan Bretnall, who is based in Britain, from traveling to the United States to be with her fiancée, Stacey, an American currently living in Puerto Rico. While U.S. travelers can technically travel to Britain, they must enter a mandatory two-week quarantine, which Ms. Bretnall said is unfeasible. The couple became engaged in December. “Right now, our life is on hold,” Ms. Bretnall said. In Europe, some married couples have only recently been reunited after months apart. Flavia Negwer, a German, and her American husband, Jeff Wong, spent months wondering how to get Mr. Wong back to Germany despite travel restriction. He had traveled to the New York area to visit family and prepare for an upcoming move to the United States this fall. But his trip of a few weeks turned into months when Europe banned nonessential travelers, leaving Mr. Wong and Ms. Negwer unsure when they might see each other again. Adding to the uncertainty, his German visa expired while he was stranded in the United States. Last week, after the European Union’s new travel guidelines came into effect, they called embassies, European officials and even the German border police to better understand the rules before Mr. Wong attempted to enter the country. They got no clear answers, but he decided to attempt to return to Germany, anyway. “I felt like I had a better understanding of the E.U. guidelines and rules than the officials that we talked to at the border,” Mr. Wong said. He was eventually let in after showing the expired visa that indicated he had lived and worked in Germany for years. The German border police said in a statement that they have clear guidelines and are actually staffing a special center that looks into and decides on unusual cases such as married couples like Mr. Wong and Ms. Negwer. The couple said that in the push for the bloc to reopen, driven largely by an economic agenda, separated couples were forgotten. “The whole E.U. is trying reopen for tourism, for economic reasons, but on the other hand they are also completely disregarding these couples,” Mr. Wong said. Ms. Lobato, who is separated from her German fiancée, said that while she understands the seriousness of the public health concerns, the right of people to see their partners must be taken into account. “We all know this virus is going to stay here for a long time,” she said. “So it’s not possible for us to go for one or one and a half years without each other.” Christopher F. Scheutze contributed reporting from Berlin.""]","As some restrictions are lifted on who can enter, unmarried couples are calling on European countries to make it possible for them to be together again."
Killing of Security Analyst Seen as Message to Iraqi Government,2020-07-07,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['BAGHDAD — The assassination of an outspoken Iraqi researcher who had antagonized the Islamic State as well as Iraq’s Shiite militias was seen Tuesday as a message to the Iraqi government, but it was unclear who killed him. The researcher, Hisham al-Hashimi, 47, was a prominent figure and a favorite of television news channels, which turned to him for his unvarnished takes on Iraq’s lack of security and the government’s difficulties confronting both Sunni Muslim and Shiite Muslim extremists. He was killed in front of his Baghdad home at dusk on Monday by two gunmen on motorcycles, who have not been caught or identified. No group claimed responsibility for his assassination, which shocked Iraqis and dominated the television news in Iraq on Tuesday. Young people who supported his views of the militias took to the streets in grief and anger. Security analysts pointed out that he had enemies both among the Sunni extremists in the Islamic State and in the Shiite militias, some of which are close to Iran. Mr. al-Hashimi also antagonized some politicians and government figures, especially in the previous government, by accusing them of failing to confront the militias that were shooting protesters during antigovernment demonstrations last fall. Analysts both inside and outside Iraq read his killing as a worrying sign for the government and a flagrant challenge to its declared effort to institute the rule of law. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who took office in May, has made it a priority to rein in the Shiite militias, and his government carried out a raid on one of them, Khataib Hezbollah, last month. Khataib Hezbollah is close to Iran and has been accused by the United States of conducting attacks that have killed three Western soldiers and a civilian contractor. Mr. al-Hashimi praised the raid, and has long goaded the government to stand up to the militias. Consequently, there was widespread suspicion that Khataib Hezbollah or an allied militia was responsible for his killing. However, Mr. al-Hashimi also irked the Islamic State, which has referred to him in statements as “the liar of Baghdad.” In recent weeks he told his brother that he had received a serious threat from the Islamic State, and he told friends he had been threatened by militias. Whichever group or figure ordered his killing was sending a message to the government, said security analysts and politicians. “This was all about Kadhimi,” said Michael Knights, a security analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, adding that Mr. al-Hashimi was “close to the Kadhimi circle.” Mr. al-Hashimi’s stinging critiques of the militias were not new, he said. What has changed recently was Mr. al-Kadhimi’s accession to power. Mr. al-Kadhimi said Tuesday that no one was “above the law” and that his government would hunt down the killers. He ordered an investigation headed by the deputy interior minister and said a street would be named after Mr. al-Hashimi. President Barham Salih said in a statement late Monday that “the assassination of the honest, patriotic, decent researcher Hisham al-Hashimi by outlaws is a vile crime that targets an Iraqi and his human right to live a free and decent life.” Mr. al-Hashimi was killed as he parked in front of his house in the middle-class Zaiouna neighborhood of Baghdad. One of the gunmen ran up to his car and, using a silencer, shot him at point-blank range. At least one of the four bullets entered the back of his neck. The two men escaped as neighbors and three of Mr. al-Hashimi’s four children helped pull his body from the car. He was taken to a hospital and died soon after. Mr. al-Hashimi, who was originally from Nasiriya in the south of Iraq, had been part of the opposition against Saddam Hussein and was imprisoned by him. When he was released in 2002, he turned to journalism, and when Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia emerged soon after, he started analyzing security incidents and gathering data. He had his own website and security center and had recently published papers related to the Iraqi militias. Most unnerving for longtime observers of Iraqi politics was the fact that the killing happened in the open and that the killers appeared to have easily escaped. “This is the biggest indication that there’s no state,’” said Izzat al-Shabandar, a longtime Iraqi politician, who is close to the security forces and a longtime opponent of the presence of foreign forces in Iraq. The Iranian-backed militias, the Islamic State and the American forces in Iraq, he said, were “all stronger than the state.” Falih Hassan contributed reporting.']","The analyst, Hisham al-Hashimi, was a proponent of government efforts to rein in the Islamic State and Iraq’s Shiite militias. Suspicion fell on both groups."
Britain Says It Will Resume Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,2020-07-07,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — One day after sanctioning 20 Saudis for human rights violations, Britain on Tuesday sent a very different signal to the government in Riyadh, ending a moratorium on arm sales to Saudi Arabia over its involvement in the bloody conflict in Yemen. A court ruling last year forced the British government to suspend sales of arms and military equipment to Saudi Arabia because of the risk they would be used in violation of international humanitarian law. But after a review, Liz Truss, Britain’s international trade secretary, said on Tuesday that procedures had been revised to comply with the court’s concerns, and that the suspension of licenses for the export of arms to Saudi Arabia was at an end. Her decision prompted anger from opposition politicians and campaigners, protests that were sharpened by the timing of the announcement. On Monday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, imposed sanctions on 47 people, including 25 Russians accused of aiding and abetting in the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died after brutal treatment in detention in 2009. The British list also included two people from Myanmar and 20 Saudis accused in the assassination of the dissident Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, whose death caused outrage around the world. Mr. Raab argued that, as it charts its new course on the international stage outside the European Union — which Britain formally quit  in January — the British government was “absolutely committed to the United Kingdom being an even stronger force for good in the world.” The Saudis named in the British sanctions list included Ahmed al-Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Both men, along with 18 others, are facing trial in absentia in Turkey for directing the 15-man hit squad that flew to Turkey from Saudi Arabia to carry out the killing. While the murder of Mr. Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia’s involvement in Yemen are very different issues, critics said that imposing sanctions while also ending a moratorium on arm sales sent contradictory signals over the balance between human rights and realpolitik in Britain’s evolving foreign policy. Saudi Arabia is a big market for British arms manufacturers. Between April 2015 and March 2018, Britain’s government licensed the sale of at least 4.7 billion pounds (around $5.89 billion) of military equipment to the Saudis, and a further £860 million to its coalition partners. Emily Thornberry, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on international trade, described the resumption of arms licenses to Saudi Arabia as “morally indefensible.” The timing, she added, suggests “at the very least a case of mixed messages, undermining the government’s claim to be human rights defenders.” Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the Campaign Against Arms Trade, described the government’s move as a “disgraceful and morally bankrupt decision,” and said that further legal steps would be explored to challenge it. Under British law, the government should not grant an export license if there is a clear risk that weapons or equipment might be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law. In a written statement to Parliament, Ms. Truss acknowledged that there had been some “credible incidents of concern” related to Saudi forces’ conduct, but said that there was no systematic pattern. “The incidents which have been assessed to be possible violations of International Humanitarian Law occurred at different times, in different circumstances and for different reasons,” she wrote. “The conclusion is that these are isolated incidents.”  The British government said in a statement that all existing and new applications for arms exports to Saudi Arabia “will be assessed against the revised methodology which considers whether there is a clear risk the equipment might be used in the commission of a serious violation of International Humanitarian Law.” “The Government takes its export responsibilities seriously and assesses all export licenses in accordance with strict licensing criteria,” the statement said. “We will not issue any export licenses where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria.”  Britain is not alone in wanting to push ahead with arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Despite opposition in Congress, the U.S. State Department informally notified lawmakers in January that it intended to proceed with the sale of precision-guided missiles worth $478 million to the country.']","Military sales were suspended over concerns about Saudi human rights violations in Yemen.

A Melania Trump Statue Is Set on Fire. Its Patron Gets Inspired.,2020-07-09,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — After a wooden statue of Melania Trump was burned near her birthplace in Slovenia over the weekend, the American artist who commissioned it said that he now wants to interview the arsonist as part of a new project. The life-size, rustic sculpture of Mrs. Trump, which was carved out of a linden tree last year by a local folk artist, showed the first lady waving a hand in the powder blue cashmere dress she wore at her husband’s inauguration in 2017. “There’s a lot of buzz around the destruction of monuments, so it could come from left-leaning people,” Brad Downey, the artist who commissioned the statue, said about the charred work near Sevnica, a rural town of 5,000 people where Mrs. Trump grew up. “Or it could be from right-leaning people, because they don’t like how it looks or think it’s disrespectful, aesthetically.” Mr. Downey had said that the statue was torched on July 4, but a spokesman for the police in Sevnica said that the blaze was started in the early hours of July 5. In an email, the spokesman, Robert Perc, added that investigations were continuing. Standing nine feet tall on the banks of the Sava, a major river in Slovenia, the sculpture drew mixed reactions when it was unveiled: with its rough-hewed features and naïve appearance, locals deemed it grotesque or said it looked like a scarecrow. But Mr. Downey said that people there generally liked the sculpture and had taken care of it — until last weekend. “The face is burned but the features are intact — we can still see the face,” said Mr. Downey, who has stored the sculpture in a temporary studio in Slovenia. He said that he planned to show the charred version at an exhibition in the country in September. “The blue dress is still all blue,” he noted. From the state of the remains, Mr. Downey said that whoever had set the statue afire had most likely put tires around the head and then dumped gasoline on it. A local police officer said the investigation was continuing and refused to comment further. A wooden statue representing President Trump in northeastern Slovenia was burned to the ground in January. The town of Sevnica has built a tourism industry around the Mrs. Trump’s origins ever since her husband entered the presidential race in 2015, with offerings such as Melania salami, Melania slippers and Melania wine. While the rural town has attracted tens of thousands of visitors, the first lady hasn’t visited Slovenia since then. Mr. Downey, a 39-year-old Berlin-based artist who defined his work as “contextual public art,” said that the sculpture was intended to question President Trump’s anti-immigration policy and what he described as a “heavy rhetoric of xenophobia.” He said he had commissioned a local sculptor, Ales Zupevc, known as Max, to create the statue because Mr. Zupevc was born in the same hospital the same month and year as Mrs. Trump: April 1970. Mr. Zupevc said in a 2019 short film made by Mr. Downey that he had never met the first lady — and that he had never before made a full human statue. Mr. Downey said that he did not want to press charges against the culprits, but he expressed a wish to interview them. “Why did you do this? Who are you? I’d love to speak to you,” he said. He added that the charred sculpture, wrapped in plastic, would remain in his temporary studio near the seaside town of Koper, in southwestern Slovenia. “I had also made a silicon mold of it, just out of precaution,” Mr. Downey said. “The statue is still here.”']","The American artist who commissioned the work near the first lady’s Slovenian hometown said he wanted to interview the arsonists. “There’s a lot of buzz around the destruction of monuments,” he noted."
"Erdogan Talks of Making Hagia Sophia a Mosque Again, to International Dismay",2020-07-08,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — Since it was built in the sixth century, changing hands from empire to empire, Hagia Sophia has been a Byzantine cathedral, a mosque under the Ottomans and finally a museum, making it one of the world’s most potent symbols of Christian-Muslim rivalry and of Turkey’s more recent devotion to secularism. Now President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is making moves to declare it a working mosque once more, fulfilling a dream for himself, his supporters and conservative Muslims far beyond Turkey’s shores — but threatening to set off an international furor. The very idea of changing the monument’s status has escalated tensions with Turkey’s longtime rival, Greece; upset Christians around the world; and set off a chorus of dismay from political and religious leaders as diverse as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church. Mr. Erdogan’s opponents say he has raised the issue of restoring Hagia Sophia as a mosque every time he has faced a political crisis, using it to stir supporters in his nationalist and conservative religious base. But given the severity of the challenges Mr. Erdogan faces after 18 years at the helm of Turkish politics, there may be more reason than ever to take the talk seriously. Having lost Istanbul in local elections last year, the president has watched the standing of his party continue to slide in the polls as the Covid-19 pandemic has further undone a vulnerable economy. On July 2, a Turkish administrative court ruled on whether to restore Hagia Sophia, or Ayasofya, its Turkish name, as a mosque, and revoke an 80-year-old decree that declared it a museum under Turkey’s secular state. The ruling will be announced within two weeks, and then Mr. Erdogan is expected to make the final decision. For more than 25 years since he became mayor of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan has been working to leave his stamp on his beloved home city. He cleaned up the Golden Horn, built bridges and tunnels across the famous waters and placed new mosques at the most prominent sites. But it is Hagia Sophia, one of the oldest and architecturally one of the most impressive cathedrals in the world, that commands pride of place on the historical peninsula. Completed in 537 AD, Hagia Sophia stood for nearly a millennium at the heart of the Christian world, crowning the fabled city of Constantinople. It is unsurpassed for its grandeur and immense dome. In 1453, Mehmed II conquered Constantinople, and although his troops plundered what they could carry, the building was saved and turned into a mosque. For 500 years it was the venerated center of the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Turks record with pride that Ottoman rulers doted on the great building, assigning the best architects to embellish it. Minarets were added, and later the great Ottoman architect Sinan built massive buttresses to prevent the walls from buckling under the weight of the dome, which was damaged in earthquakes. With the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the status of Hagia Sophia changed again. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the modern secular republic of Turkey, ended the role of religion in the state and closed religious institutions. Byzantine churches, including Hagia Sophia, were made into museums, ending their religious function and opening them up for tourism, conservation and study. But Mr. Erdogan’s supporters speak of the building as the third holiest site in Islam, after the Grand Mosque of Mecca and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and insist that once a mosque it should never be unconsecrated. Mr. Erdogan, who comes from a conservative Muslim tradition, has overseen a steady chipping away of the secular rules of the Ataturk republic, with a concerted effort to revive the glories of the Ottoman era. At the end of May, he gave his strongest signal yet on Hagia Sophia, as he opened — remotely, because of the coronavirus — a ceremony and sound-and-light show to commemorate the 567th anniversary of the conquest of Constantinople by the Muslim army of Mehmed II the Conqueror. For the first time in more than 80 years, an imam seated on a carpeted dais before a copy of the Quran recited the verse known as the Conquest surah, which celebrates the Treaty of Hudaibiyah between the people of Mecca and Medina. The recitation upset many. The Foreign Ministry of Greece, which sees itself as the heir to the Byzantine Empire — which was Greek-speaking and Christian — denounced it as unacceptable and a breach of Hagia Sophia’s status as a world heritage site under UNESCO. The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew, who is the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church from his seat in Istanbul, said the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque would disappoint millions of Christians around the world and would divide Muslims and Christians when it had been a place of worship for both. “We consider it as detrimental,” he said in a sermon last week, “for Hagia Sophia, which, due to its dedication to the Wisdom of God is a point of encounter and a source of fascination for the faithful of both religions, to become, in the 21st century, a cause of confrontation and conflict.” He urged the Turks to honor what he described as their obligation to the world. “The Turkish people have the great responsibility and the highest honor to give prominence to the universality of this exquisite monument,” he said. Mr. Pompeo urged Turkey before the court hearing to respect the diverse traditions and faiths of Turkey’s history and keep Hagia Sophia as a museum accessible to all. Many in Turkey see the entire debate as a political ploy by Mr. Erdogan to remain ahead of his many rivals, especially as former members of his Justice and Development Party have broken away to form their own political parties and threaten to draw away some of his conservative Muslim base. He has made it a nationalist issue, lashing out at Greece for interfering in his country’s affairs and insisting that Turkey was proceeding according to the law. “Is it you managing Turkey or us?” he said. “Turkey has its own institutions.” His nationalist coalition ally Devlet Bahceli weighed in with a speech on the same day: “Hagia Sophia is the conquest Mosque of the Muslim Turkish nation. This truth will not change.” “This shows that there is something catching fire, something burning in the dynamics of this country,” Mr. Erdogan added. Even a former member of Mr. Erdogan’s cabinet, Ertugrul Gunay, who served as minister of culture for five years, said Mr. Erdogan was making a fanfare over Hagia Sophia only to show he was still master of Istanbul after his electoral loss. “The need to be more visible in Istanbul and to claim ownership of certain rituals about history and religion emerged,” he said in a television interview. “There are multitudes of grand mosques spread throughout Istanbul,” he added in a text message. “This discussion of Hagia Sophia to be converted to a mosque done by the conservatives of Turkey is an old and unnecessary discussion.” Beyond politics, art historians and conservationists worry that they will lose access for study and research if the monument becomes a working mosque, and tourist companies and city authorities fear that visitors will be deterred from coming. The monument is the most visited tourist site in Turkey, with 3.7 million visitors last year. “I am more interested in preserving Hagia Sophia as a cultural treasure,” said Zeynep Ahunbay, a conservation architect who has worked on the scientific committee for Hagia Sophia for 25 years. “The best way to preserve and present it is by the museum function.” The greatest worry is what will happen to the incomparable medieval mosaics, among them depictions of Christ, the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist, alongside rare portraits of imperial figures including Emperor Justinian I and Empress Zoe, one of the few women to rule in her own right. The mosaics were whitewashed for the more than five centuries during Ottoman rule — the depiction of the human form being considered idolatry — and were uncovered and restored only after Hagia Sophia was turned into a museum in the 1930s. “We don’t know what will happen to the mosaics and frescos,” said Faruk Pekin, founder of Fest Travel, which specializes in cultural tours and led 80 nighttime tours of Hagia Sophia last year. One of the delights of touring the building at night, he said, was that the dome seems even larger and the gold mosaics gleam more brilliantly in the dim light. Visitors pay double for the nighttime tour, and most of his customers are Turkish, he said. If the museum becomes a mosque, the mosaics will have to be covered during Muslim prayers somehow, including seraphs high up at the base of the dome. Tourists and non-Muslims may be restricted to certain areas, he said. “I still hope it will not happen.”']","The World Heritage site was once a potent symbol of Christian-Muslim rivalry, and it could become one once more."
Ivory Coast Prime Minister Dies After Cabinet Meeting,2020-07-08,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — The prime minister of Ivory Coast, a candidate for president in a coming election, died suddenly, the country’s president announced on Wednesday. The death of Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, 61, cast uncertainty on the West African country’s presidential election in three months, in which he was to be the ruling party’s candidate. The cause of death was not immediately clear. He died following a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon, soon after having returned from France, where he had spent two months receiving medical treatment for a heart condition. The president, Alassane Ouattara, 78, paid tribute to the colleague he called “my little brother, my son,” in a message praising his devotion and loyalty, posted on Twitter on Wednesday evening. Mr. Coulibaly was the candidate the president had picked after deciding not to run for a third term as president. “He embodied this young generation of Ivorians of great skill and extreme loyalty to the nation,” the president wrote. Mr. Coulibaly was Mr. Ouattara’s right-hand man. He previously served as minister of agriculture under Laurent Gbagbo, the former president who was tried and, last year, acquitted of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Mr. Gbagbo’s refusal to give up power when he lost an election in 2010 to Mr. Ouattara led to a civil war in which thousands died. In part because he belonged to a powerful family from Ivory Coast’s north, Mr. Coulibaly was instrumental in gaining popular support in the region for the party Mr. Ouattara came to lead, the Rally of the Republicans (R.D.R. by its French acronym). “He was the president’s most loyal collaborator,” said Dr. Arthur Banga, a historian at the University of Cocody in Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast.   Eromo Egbejule contributed reporting from Abidjan, Ivory Coast.']","Amadou Gon Coulibaly had just returned to the West African country from France, where he had been receiving treatment for a heart condition."
"A Bird? A Plane? No, It’s a Google Balloon Beaming the Internet",2020-07-07,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — A fleet of high-altitude balloons started delivering internet service to Kenya on Tuesday, extending online access to tens of thousands of people in the first-ever commercial deployment of the technology. The balloons, which hover about 12 miles up in the stratosphere — well above commercial airplanes — will initially provide a 4G LTE network connection to a nearly 31,000-square-mile area across central and western Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi. Loon, a unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, launched 35 balloons in recent months in preparation for Tuesday’s start. It is collaborating with Telkom Kenya, the East African nation’s third-largest carrier. The balloons had previously been used only in emergency situations, such as in Puerto Rico in 2017 after Hurricane Maria wiped out cell towers. Loon bills the service as a cost-effective solution to the difficult challenge of bringing internet access to people in underserved remote areas. The Kenya venture is being closely watched by telecom providers in other countries as a test of whether the technology is reliable and the service can be profitable. Some technology experts have said the balloons would be better deployed elsewhere. Kenya already has far more of its citizens connected to the internet, an estimated 39 million out of 48 million people, than many other countries in the developing world. But Loon’s leaders, who inaugurated the balloon service after two years of testing, said they had chosen Kenya because of its openness to adopting new technologies. “Kenya is an ideal place for us to begin this new era of stratospheric communications,” Alastair Westgarth, Loon’s chief executive, said in an interview conducted by email. “The country has been incredibly innovative about finding new ways to connect unconnected populations. As a new, innovative technology, this is a great fit.” The balloons, made from sheets of polyethylene, are the size of tennis courts. They are powered by solar panels and controlled by software on the ground. While up in the air, they act as “floating cell towers,” transmitting internet signals to ground stations and personal devices. They last for well over 100 days in the stratosphere before being returned to earth. By allowing phone companies to expand their coverage where needed, the balloons are intended to offer countries a cheaper option than laying cables or building cell towers. This could be effective in Africa, where just over 28 percent of the continent’s 1.3 billion people were using the internet in 2019 — the lowest rate in any region worldwide — according to the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency. And even as more users have come online, internet costs remain too high for many Africans. The Kenyan authorities have said the balloons will help the country retain its competitive advantage in technological innovation. In the course of the testing that led up to Tuesday’s launch, over 35,000 users on the Telkom network connected to the internet through a Loon balloon. The users, some in remote towns in Kenya, used the service to stream video, browse websites and make video and voice calls on applications like WhatsApp. Executives with Loon would not reveal the costs of the Telkom contract or any financial arrangements. Loon, which is based in California and started operating in 2011, is one of the so-called moonshots to emerge from Alphabet’s research and development lab, known as X. Loon was spun off into a separate company in 2018 with the mandate to be a viable enterprise of its own. Other companies that have emerged from X include Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car unit. Loon delivered emergency service to over 200,000 people in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, in collaboration with AT&T and T-Mobile. In 2019, after an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 hit Peru, Loon brought LTE service to the affected area in conjunction with the telecommunications company Telefónica. Last November, the company announced that it would bring connectivity to secluded areas of the Amazon rainforest region in Peru. This year, Loon signed a deal with Vodacom to bring internet service to Mozambique. Loon is hoping to succeed in Africa where another American tech giant failed. Facebook backed efforts to beam internet connections into remote parts of the continent using drones, but abandoned the venture after several setbacks. Critics called the efforts a scheme to find new users for a platform whose reach already extends to nearly every corner of the globe. The Loon project in Kenya has also drawn criticism from some quarters. Some say that Loon and Telkom are launching the service in parts of the country where cellular networks have already been expanded, instead of targeting underserved regions like north or northeastern Kenya. Many people in poor or remote areas cannot afford phones that are compatible with the 4G service Loon provides. “I feel this solution is inordinate with the problem being solved,” said Phares Kariuki, the chief executive of Node Africa, a data management company. He noted that most Kenyans already had access to the internet — largely thanks to the proliferation of cellphone towers and fiber optic cables. “Loon is a fringe solution for places where last-mile connectivity will be too expensive because the people are sparsely populated,” Mr. Kariuki said. “It’s not the best solution for this market.” Others in Kenya welcomed the project, saying that the stratospheric balloons complement both ground and satellite technologies to help get more people online. The coronavirus pandemic also proves that connectivity is an essential service that should be strengthened more than ever, said Mark Kaigwa, founder of Nendo, a Nairobi-based technology research firm. “I think our current time of Covid-19 requires us to rethink infrastructure, essential services, movement of people, collection of data and connectivity,” Mr. Kaigwa said by telephone. Any venture that can help remove one more barrier can make a big difference, he said. “The answer to ‘Is Loon realistic?’ Well, it’s what we’ve got,” Mr. Kaigwa said. “Until we can rapidly recreate cell towers and networks,” he said, “we need an alternative like Loon.” Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif.']","A commercial deal in Kenya marks the first application of balloon-powered internet in Africa, the region with the lowest percentage of internet users globally."
Macron’s New Cabinet Stirs Ire of French Feminists,2020-07-08,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — From early on, President Emmanuel Macron pledged to make equality for French women “the cause of my term,” even appointing a junior minister to fight for it, and vowing the “complete elimination of violence against women” in a 2017 speech. So there was surprise this week, and consternation among French feminists, at two of his new cabinet appointments, both of which are regarded as severe betrayals of that early promise. Mr. Macron’s vow to give a fresh wind to his government with the cabinet reshuffle was quickly clouded. Mr. Macron’s new interior minister and head of the national police, Gerald Darmanin, has been accused of rape in an affair that dates to 2009. His choice for justice minister, a celebrity lawyer named Eric Dupond-Moretti, who is ubiquitous on French television, has drawn the ire of feminists in France for hostile and insensitive remarks. Over a thousand people demonstrated outside City Hall in Paris on Friday to protest the appointments. There were also antigovernment demonstrations in Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lyon, Nantes and Grenoble. In Paris, the protesters held hand-painted signs with slogans like  “Ministry of Rape” and “Sexist government reshuffle — Feminist answer.” In Toulouse it was  “Rapists in prison, not in the government.” “The level of anger in feminist movements is huge,” said Caroline De Haas, a leading French feminist and founder of the group Nous Toutes! (All of Us). “At least, before, they pretended,”  Ms. De Haas said. “Now, they are not even pretending. These appointments are acts of anti-feminism.” Mr. Darmanin “is the target of a rape complaint, and he’s the head of the police — how can that be?” asked Ms. De Haas. “It’s difficult enough to bring a rape complaint. So now, the message to women is, it’s not a priority.” For others, too, the appointments signaled the end of the government’s commitment to advancing the rights of women in France, where the “Me Too” movement has raised some awareness of issues like sexism and violence against women, but fallen short of introducing a sea change in what remains a deeply patriarchal society. Beyond feminist circles, the reaction to the appointments was far more muted. The question of Mr. Darmanin hardly came up in Parliament this week. Neither of the country’s two leading newspapers, Le Monde and Le Figaro, editorialized against them. The left-leaning newspaper Libération, reacting to Mr. Macron’s appointments, ran a front-page headline merely noting, “It Begins Badly,” with a play on the French words for “male” and “bad” about Mr. Macron’s new cabinet. “This is France. It doesn’t surprise me,” said Fatima Benomar, founder of the group Les Effronté-es, The Brazen Ones. “To put at the head of the police a man accused of rape and at the head of justice someone who is overtly anti-feminist, it’s their way of saying, ‘the feminist mobilization is over,’ ” she said. “So, we’re expecting nothing from this government.” The government is evidently hoping it will all blow over, and its airy dismissals Wednesday of the outcry suggested as much. Still, it was an unwelcome drag on a president who has insisted he wants to put a new face on a government that has had, since the beginning of Mr. Macron’s mandate in 2017, trouble maintaining the French public’s esteem. M. Macron has two more years to go, but this week’s appointments did little to help his 2022 re-election chances. On Tuesday, some 20 feminists demonstrated in front of the interior ministry as Mr. Darmanin was assuming his new post, chanting “Darmanin resign,” and “Darmanin rapist.” In front of the Madeleine church, demonstrators in black symbolically buried female equality, while a spokeswoman told reporters there that Mr. Darmanin’s appointment had dealt a “fatal blow” to the cause. “Culture of Rape on the Move!” read one of the signs. Demonstrations also took place in Lyon and Lille. Women’s groups are vowing more action. “This was just the first droplet,” Ms. Benomar said. The rape accusation against Mr. Darmanin, first dismissed by French justice in 2018, was reopened this past June when a Paris appeals court decided that the preliminary investigation had not gone far enough. As for the justice minister, Mr. Dupond-Moretti, he is celebrated for his “big mouth” and for winning a legendary string of acquittals as a defense lawyer. But activists are not ready to forgive him for calling the trial of a local official accused of several rapes, whom Mr. Dupond-Moretti defended, “an illustration of the war between the sexes.” The flamboyant lawyer told GQ magazine last year: “In my day, when a girl rejected you, we called that getting blown off. These days, it’s a crime. Look, when it’s no, it’s no, ok. But what are you supposed to do for a French kiss these days? You’re supposed to send a registered letter, and wait for a reply?” It is Mr. Darmanin’s case that could cause the Macron government the most trouble, and it has already leapt to his defense. Mr. Darmanin, a 37-year-old political whiz kid who was previously public accounts minister, is the son of a cleaning lady and a bartender and the grandson of an Algerian volunteer in the French Army, and he illustrates Mr. Macron’s penchant for meritocracy. One of his first acts as interior minister this week was an attempt to soothe police unions angered by his dismissed predecessor’s mild suggestions that racism was a problem in the police. That provoked a furious reaction in police ranks, frightening Mr. Macron’s government; successive French governments have lived in fear of disquiet in the police unions. But Mr. Darmanin comes with heavy baggage. In 2017, shortly after he became a minister for Mr. Macron, a fellow political party member, Sophie Spatz, accused him of having raped her in 2009. Mr. Darmanin was then a functionary at party headquarters in the legal department, and a municipal councilor in the northern city of Tourcoing. He has always maintained the encounter was consensual. Ms. Spatz had gone to the then-26-year-old fledgling politician with a request: help her erase a previous conviction and suspended prison sentence for blackmail and threats, “tied to her former activities as an escort-girl,” according to court papers. Ms. Spatz, by 2009 married and eager to wipe out the stain, had already deluged French justice officials with claims she had been wrongly convicted. Finally she went to see Mr. Darmanin. He invited her to dinner, according to the court papers, and he promised to help by writing a letter. “He took her hand and said, ‘Me too, you’ve got to help me,’ ’’ the document says. “She told Gerald Darmanin that she had to go home because her husband was waiting for her,” it says. She didn’t go home. Dinner was followed by a ‘‘swinger’s nightclub’’ and then a hotel room. Afterward, “she thought that he had forced sex on her and that she had no choice, because this letter was her only hope and he had promised he would make her ‘innocent,’ ’’ according to the court papers. She told her now ex-husband that she had been “obligated to sleep with Gerald Darmanin because he could make her innocent and that otherwise she wouldn’t have done it,” the court papers state. Mr. Darmanin has maintained to investigators that she led him on throughout the evening. He has filed a libel suit against her. The government is counting on the public losing interest. “I’m totally ok with this appointment,” Mr. Macron’s new prime minister, Jean Castex, said on French television Wednesday. Mr. Darmanin “has the right, like everybody, to the presumption of innocence,” Mr. Castex said. On Wednesday Mr. Castex, previously a high-ranking civil servant, had a rocky baptism by fire in front of the National Assembly. The far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said afterward that the parliamentary deputies had been subjected to a “hurricane of banalities” from the mild-mannered new prime minister. On the subject of Mr. Darmanin, Mr. Castex told French television that he wouldn’t have been named to the government “if in my soul and conscience, having looked at this, I had had the slightest doubt.” Ms. Patterson’s lawyer, Élodie Tuaillon-Hibon, is not convinced. “I’m revolted, as her lawyer and as a French citizen,” she said. “I’m dismayed. I had no idea that the presumption of innocence could get you a ministry.” “What this means is that he’s the boss of the investigative police who will have to carry out investigations of him,” she said. Daphné Angles contributed reporting.']","The new interior minister and head of national police has been accused of rape in the past, and the justice minister is a celebrity lawyer known for insensitive remarks."
President Bolsonaro of Brazil Tests Positive for Coronavirus,2020-07-07,"By Ernesto Londoño, Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who has railed against social distancing measures and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus as the epidemic in his country became the second-worst in the world, said Tuesday that he, too, had been infected. Critics at home and abroad have called Mr. Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic cavalier and reckless, allowing the virus to surge across Brazil, Latin America’s largest nation. At one point he dismissed it as “a measly cold,” and when asked in late April about the rising death toll, he replied: “So what? Sorry, but what do you want me to do?” As the caseload has skyrocketed, Mr. Bolsonaro has shunned masks, attended mass rallies of his supporters, insisted that the virus poses no threat to healthy people, championed unproven remedies and shuffled through health ministers who disagreed with him.  Brazil now has more than 1.6 million confirmed cases and more than 65,000 deaths — more than any country except the United States. Mr. Bolsonaro fell ill two days after he and a handful of his ministers attended a Fourth of July luncheon at the residence of Todd Chapman, the American ambassador in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro and other attendees sat shoulder-to-shoulder, embracing with no masks. The ambassador and his wife have since tested negative for the virus, but will remain at home, in quarantine, the embassy said. Speaking to journalists outside the presidential palace in Brasília shortly after noon on Tuesday, Mr. Bolsonaro, said he had taken a test on Monday after experiencing fatigue, muscle pain and a fever. He said he was feeling “very well,” which he credited to having taken hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug he has endorsed but which studies show does not ward off the virus. Covid-19 cases that become serious often take a turn for the worse about a week after symptoms emerge. Mr. Bolsonaro did not express contrition for his handling of the pandemic, and doubled down on his assertion that the virus poses little risk to healthy people.  He characterized the diagnosis as a predictable outcome of a leadership style that requires him to be among the people.  “I am the president, I have to be on the front lines of the fight,” he said, comparing the virus to “rain, which is going to get to you.” After taking questions from journalists, Mr. Bolsonaro stepped back a few feet, removed the mask he had been wearing and smiled.  “Thank you to all those who prayed for me and rooted for me,” he said. “I’m fine, thank God. Those who have criticized me, that’s fine, they can continue to criticize me.” Even as several of Mr. Bolsonaro’s aides have tested positive for the virus in recent months, the president has often eschewed precautions, boasting of how his athletic background would protect him and encouraging his supporters to flout lockdown measures imposed by city and state officials.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain also rebuffed social distancing advice and resisted lockdown measures, though he was never as dismissive as Mr. Bolsonaro. But after he became seriously ill with Covid and spent several days in a hospital, he appeared to take the danger more seriously, and made a point of praising overburdened health care workers. Mr. Bolsonaro’s management of the virus has deeply divided his country, with many opponents expressing their rage at his heedless approach by banging pots and pans at their windows in the evenings. As Brazilians awaited the results of the president’s latest coronavirus test, messages posted on social media illustrated how politically polarized the country had become.  Two trending hashtags on Twitter Tuesday morning were #ForçaBolsonaro and #ForçaCorona — the first sending the president strength and the other effectively expressing hope that the president would fall ill. When she heard the news, Day Medeiros, a 31-year-old community activist in Santa Cruz, a working-class neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, said she was immediately worried about how Bolsonaro supporters there would receive it. Hers is one of the neighborhoods with the highest contingent of Bolsonaro voters in the city. “My concern is that he will use this to say, ‘See, I’m fine, if you catch this you will survive,’” she said. “Everything that happens to him has real repercussions in how people behave here. This is really serious.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s diagnosis is the latest challenge for a government that has been rocked in recent months by abrupt cabinet departures and a series of legislative and criminal investigations targeting the president and his relatives. As the country’s coronavirus caseload ballooned, Mr. Bolsonaro fired his first health minister in April over disagreements about the response to the virus, and drove his second one to quit less than a month into the job. Since mid-May, an active-duty army general with no experience in health care has headed the ministry, which has been faulted for failing to mount a robust testing and contact tracing strategy. As the health crisis worsened, Mr. Bolsonaro sparred with governors and mayors who imposed loosely-enforced lockdowns and quarantines. Claiming that local officials were presenting an unduly grim picture of the pandemic, Mr. Bolsonaro in June called on supporters to break into hospitals and film what they saw. The president’s illness will do little to alter Brazil’s approach unless he experiences serious complications, politicians and public experts predicted. The country is now in the process of reopening, with Brazilians packing bars, beaches and public spaces. A mild case could leave Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters feeling vindicated, and accelerate the reopening of businesses in Brazil that began in recent weeks, when bars and gyms started welcoming patrons again. “I don’t think we’ll see any significant changes,” Senator Alessandro Vieira, an opposition lawmaker. “Their denial is absolute, a bizarre thing.” Supporters of the president praised him for disclosing his condition promptly and predicted he would recover quickly by taking the anti-malaria drug. “I’m praying for his recovery,” Sóstenes Cavalcante, a congressman from Rio de Janeiro wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations to the president for being transparent with the Brazilian people. We are all at risk of contracting the virus and our opinion on SOCIAL DISTANCING will not change at all.” If the president is among the majority of Covid-19 patients who do not become gravely ill, he will be widely seen as living proof of the merits of hydroxychloroquine, said Denise Garrett, a Brazilian-American epidemiologist. Despite the lack of evidence that the drug helps, and its potentially dangerous side effects, many Brazilians believe in the drug, said Dr. Garrett, who formerly worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fernando Haddad, the leftist politician Mr. Bolsonaro defeated in the 2018 presidential race, faulted the president’s handling of the crisis for the disease’s spread in Brazil. “I regret that more than 1.6 million people have been infected and the fact that we’ve had the world’s worst response,” he wrote on Twitter. “I hope they all recover, including Mr. Bolsonaro. To relatives of those who have left us due to the government’s neglect, my sincere condolences.” The president said on Tuesday that his illness did not alter his view that Brazilians needed to continue working. A bigger threat than the virus, he said, was failure to get workers back on the job in an economy that is expected to contract by up to 10 percent this year. “There is no need to panic,” he said. “Life goes on.”']","After months of denying the seriousness of the pandemic and brushing aside protective measures, Mr. Bolsonaro felt symptoms of Covid-19.

Bolsonaro Hails Anti-Malaria Pill Even as He Fights Coronavirus,2020-07-08,By Ernesto Londoño,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil has been presenting an image of resilience and vigor as he fights the coronavirus, flashing smiles and thumbs-up, posting on social media — and enthusiastically promoting the drug hydroxychloroquine. His attitude during convalescence is consistent with his widely-discredited contention that the virus poses little threat to people who are healthy, and his endorsement of the drug, though studies have found no evidence that it works on Covid-19 patients, but have shown possible danger in taking it. “I’m doing much better than I was,” Mr. Bolsonaro, 65, said in a video posted Tuesday night as he washed down a dose of hydroxychloroquine with water. “It’s working.” Mr. Bolsonaro acknowledged that there are no drugs scientifically proven to treat Covid-19, but he said: “I’m one more person it’s working on. I trust hydroxychloroquine.” In the United States, the National Institutes of Health in June stopped a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine, saying the drug did not work, and the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in May, explaining that the medication can cause dangerous abnormalities in the heart rhythm of coronavirus patients. The president’s illness, which he disclosed on Tuesday, has reignited debate over the government’s handling of the pandemic: Mr. Bolsonaro has downplayed the danger posed by the virus, encouraged Brazilians to brush aside quarantine measures adopted by states, and urged Brazilians to continue working. The virus has infected more than 1.7 million people and killed about 68,000 patients in Brazil, and it is not slowing down. On Tuesday, the country reported 45,305 new infections and 1,254 deaths. The president’s critics, including health experts, fear that his insistent endorsements of hydroxychloroquine will encourage many more people to take it, while not taking precautions to avoid infection. And if Mr. Bolsonaro recovers quickly without serious complications, they say, it would add to that false sense of invulnerability. In an editorial, the newspaper O Globo called Mr. Bolsonaro’s latest statement “irresponsible marketing” for a drug that can have dangerous side effects in patients with heart conditions. His stance is a lonely one among major world leaders. Even President Trump, who for months enthusiastically promoted hydroxychloroquine, took it for only two weeks and mentioned it less often after studies cast doubt on it. With symptoms that appear mild so far, Mr. Bolsonaro showed no sign that testing positive for the virus had made him any less dismissive of the merits of social distancing, mask wearing and other measures that have enabled other countries to rein in transmission and save lives. Despite his apparent confidence, Mr. Bolsonaro is not out of danger. It often takes about a week after symptoms emerge for Covid-19 cases that become serious to shift for the worse. Nelson Teich, a doctor who stepped down as health minister in mid-May, less than a month into the job, warned in a column published Wednesday that the country is in dire need of a data-driven strategy to reopen the economy while mitigating risks. “We’re in a race against time,” he wrote in an article published in O Globo under the headline “It’s Almost like Waiting for a Miracle.” “The longer the quarantine lasts,” he added, “the harder it will be to manage the consequences of the impact of Covid-19 in the health sector, the economy and people’s behavior.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s leadership during the pandemic has been criticized at home and abroad as among the most disastrous in the world. The country’s infection and death totals are second only to those of the United States. Brazil’s contagion rate remains high, and may spike higher as restaurants, bars and gyms are reopening. Since mid-May, the health ministry has been run by an active-duty army general with no public health background, who acquiesced to Mr. Bolsonaro’s demand that hydroxychloroquine be included in the protocol to treat Covid-19 patients in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro’s two former health ministers resisted that move, regarding it as irresponsible. Yet the president on Wednesday held out Brazil’s response as exemplary. “No country in the world has done what Brazil has,” he wrote in a message on Twitter. “We saved lives and jobs without creating panic, which also leads to depression and death. I always maintained that the fight against the virus could not have a collateral effect worse than the virus itself.”']","He is infected and has Covid-19 symptoms, but Brazil’s president still endorses hydroxychloroquine, an unproven treatment. He projects optimism amid a pandemic that kills over 1,000 Brazilians a day."
"Years After 43 Mexican Students Vanished, a Victim’s Remains Are Found",2020-07-07,"By Kirk Semple, Paulina Villegas and Natalie Kitroeff","['MEXICO CITY — Nearly six years after 43 college students disappeared in rural Mexico, the government announced the first major breakthrough in its investigation on Tuesday: Forensic scientists have identified the remains of one of the students. Bone fragments found near where the students disappeared have been tested by Institute of Genetics at the University of Innsbruck, in Austria, and identified as the remains of Christian Alfonso Rodríguez Telumbre, one of the students, said Omar Gómez Trejo, the special prosecutor assigned to the case. He added that forensic experts from Argentina had confirmed the findings. The discovery marked a fresh sign of progress toward solving a case that traumatized Mexico and became a symbol of rampant corruption in the country’s justice system. It has long been assumed that the missing students were killed, and various people in authority have been implicated, but no one has been put on trial and the motive remains a mystery. “We have broken the pact of impunity and silence that surrounded” the case, Mr. Trejo said at a news conference. He added, “today we tell the families and society that the right to the truth will prevail.” The discovery was a victory for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who had promised to prioritize the investigations — and who desperately needs a political boost amid a plummeting economy, soaring crime and a coronavirus pandemic that continues to worsen in Mexico. The announcement came on the eve of Mr. López Obrador’s visit with President Trump in Washington — a trip for which the Mexican president was roundly criticized at home, because of the American president’s harsh language about Mexico and Mexicans. For the missing students’ relatives, who for years have demanded a more robust government investigation into their loved ones’ whereabouts, the identification represented a long-awaited step toward closure. Mr. Telumbre is only the second to be found, and the first since December, 2014, when a bone fragment was identified as belonging to another missing student, Alexander Mora. “For Christian’s family this is devastating news, and for the rest of the families it is the materialization of their worst fears that this might have been all of the students’ destiny,” said Santiago Aguirre, director of Centro Prodh, a human rights organization that represents the families. They expect it to be “the beginning of a new and serious investigation that once and for all clarifies what happened to every single one of the students,” he said. The students were undergraduates at a teachers’ college in the town of Ayotzinapa in the southern state of Guerrero. The night they disappeared — Sept. 26, 2014 — they were in the process of commandeering buses to carry their peers to a demonstration in Mexico City, a time-honored tradition among students at their college and one that was mostly tolerated by the bus companies. But their escapade quickly devolved into a long, harrowing and chaotic night of terror and violence that involved law-enforcement and other gunmen, according to two reports released by an international panel of investigators several years ago. By daybreak, six people were dead in the city of Iguala, dozens were wounded and the 43 students had vanished. Even in a country often wracked by violence, the incident horrified people and spurred huge, nationwide protests demanding that the government solve the mystery and end corruption and impunity. In 2015, after months of investigation, the administration of then-President Enrique Peña Nieto concluded that the students had been kidnapped by police officers working on behalf of a criminal group, which in turn killed them, burned their bodies in a trash dump and disposed of their ashes in a river. But the panel of international investigators, experts in forensics and human rights who examined the case for a year at the invitation of the Mexican government, thoroughly discredited the government’s findings. The panel said the authorities had tried to thwart its work, questioning the integrity of the Mexican criminal justice system and the government’s commitment to finding the truth. They determined that suspects had given testimony under torture or under otherwise “cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.” The experts also questioned the Mexican authorities’ handling of evidence and their failure to pursue certain promising lines of inquiry. It later emerged that the experts, in addition to suffering a campaign of harassment and interference, had been targeted by spyware purchased by the Mexican government. Mr. Aguirre, the lawyer representing the families, said on Tuesday that an anonymous call led investigators to a specific spot in Cocula, a town near Iguala, where the remains were found — about half a mile from the garbage dump. More remains are likely to be found in that location, he said. The new discovery “breaks away from the narrative of a lie” by the former government that was meant to foreclose further investigation, said Mr. Trejo, the special prosecutor. After taking office in July 2018, Mr. López Obrador quickly began to make good on his campaign promise to redress his predecessor’s mishandling of the case. His first official decree, signed two days after his inauguration, established a special presidential commission to support the families of the victims and get to the bottom of the case. He has since invited the international panel of experts to return to assist with the investigation, and the country’s independent attorney general has created a special investigative unit dedicated to solving the case. In the past year, investigators have combed numerous sites looking for evidence, and have sought the arrests of more than 50 people in connection with the case. Many are former government officials who were involved in the investigation during Mr. Peña Nieto’s term; some have been accused of torture, forced disappearance and obstruction of justice. Among the suspects is Tomás Zerón, who had been the chief of criminal investigations in the attorney general’s office during Mr. Peña Nieto’s term and was investigated for his handling of witnesses and evidence. Officials say Mr. Zerón fled the country months ago prompting an Interpol notice for his arrest.']",The identification of one victim’s remains is the first sign of progress in years in a case that traumatized Mexico and became a symbol of corruption and injustice.
Bolsonaro Takes New Coronavirus Test After Attending Lunch Without Mask,2020-07-07,"By Ernesto Londoño, Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said Monday night that he went to the hospital for a lung scan and would take a new test for the novel coronavirus. He took those steps after developing symptoms of the virus, including a fever, according to a report in Portuguese from CNN Brasil. Even as several of Mr. Bolsonaro’s aides have tested positive for the virus in recent months, the president has often eschewed precautions such as mask wearing and social distancing. Most recently, he attended a luncheon on Saturday hosted by the American ambassador in Brazil to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday. A photo taken during the lunch and posted on Twitter by Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo shows the president sitting next to the United States Ambassador to Brazil, Todd Chapman, giving a thumbs-up sign at a table decorated for the holiday. Neither was wearing a mask. Late Monday, the president’s office said Mr. Bolsonaro’s test results were expected on Tuesday. “The president, at this time, is in good health and remains at his residence,” the statement said. Also on Monday night, the U.S. embassy signaled concern that the ambassador might have been exposed to the virus, saying that Mr. Chapman does not have any symptoms but intends to get tested and “is taking the proper precautions,” including following contact tracing protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control. “Our two governments have continuous communication, including on this matter,” the embassy statement said. “We wish President Bolsonaro a prompt recovery.” While he awaits the test results, Mr. Bolsonaro cleared his schedule on Tuesday, according to several Brazilian press reports. When he returned to the presidential palace on Monday evening, Mr. Bolsonaro told a group of supporters that his lung scan looked “clean” and that “everything was OK.” CNN reported that Mr. Bolsonaro, 65, had a fever above 100 degrees and had begun taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria pill he has promoted as effective to treat the virus. The report attributed that information to the president himself. Mr. Bolsonaro has come under criticism for his cavalier handling of the pandemic, even as Brazil’s caseload and death toll ballooned in recent months. Brazil’s more than 1.6 million cases and more than 65,000 deaths make it the second hardest-hit country by the pandemic, trailing only the United States. Even so, Mr. Bolsonaro has called the quarantines imposed by Brazilian states unjustifiably damaging to the economy. And he has often ventured out in public without wearing a mask, in violation of a mandatory rule in the capital. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: A federal judge last month issued an order calling on the president to wear a mask in public. Since then, the president has more consistently worn a mask when he is outdoors. Several cabinet members joined Mr. Bolsonaro at the Fourth of July celebration at the American ambassador’s residence. Traditionally, the embassy has thrown a large party to mark the American holiday. Instead, this year, Mr. Chapman hosted the president and a small delegation. The embassy did not immediately respond to questions about what precautions, if any, were taken to protect attendees at the luncheon. Several senior officials in the Bolsonaro administration tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from a trip to Florida in early March, where Mr. Bolsonaro dined with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Since then, Mr. Bolsonaro has taken several coronavirus tests, and asserted that all came back negative. Still, he has suggested that contracting the virus would not pose a serious threat because he has “an athlete’s background.”']",President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said he would take another test for the coronavirus after a news report indicated he had developed symptoms of Covid-19.
Accusations of Serial Rape Push Egypt Toward a Reckoning,2020-07-08,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — Obscene messages. Blackmail threats. Rape. A flood of accusations against a 21-year-old Egyptian university student who attended some of the country’s most exclusive schools poured out on social media in the past week after dozens of women posted detailed allegations of sexual harassment and assault. Within days, an Instagram page set up to expose him identified 93 credible accusers, some as young as 13, the campaign organizers said. Several of the accusers were fellow students at the American University in Cairo, a prestigious institution favored by children from some of Egypt’s wealthiest and most powerful families. On Saturday, three days after the Instagram page went up, the Cairo police arrested the student, Ahmed Bassam Zaki, at his home in an upmarket suburb. The swift and public action was a remarkable turn for Egypt, where sexual harassment and assault are woefully common and victims are afraid to speak out for fear they themselves could be blamed. With its mix of wealthy families, expensive schools and shocking accusations, the case has made headline news in Egypt and become the hot topic of talk shows and social media. And its brand of social media activism has generated the seeds of a national reckoning, another Egyptian #MeToo moment. By Tuesday, the state-run National Council for Women said it had received over 400 complaints involving various forms of violence against women since the furor erupted. The news media, which is heavily influenced by the government, has been largely supportive of Mr. Zaki’s accusers. Scholars at Al Azhar, the ancient center of Sunni Islamic scholarship, took their side too, issuing a statement encouraging women to testify about sexual assault and rejecting any suggestion that their dress or behavior was to blame. “It’s a message to the community that we need to change our culture,” said Ahmed Barakat, a spokesman for Al Azhar. “In Eastern culture, some victims are afraid to speak out because they feel shame. We need to push them forward.” Egypt gained notoriety for sexual violence after high-profile attacks in 2011, when post-Arab Spring protests were marred by assaults on women in Tahrir Square, and 2014, when a woman was gang-raped in public after celebrations for the inauguration of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as president. In January, outrage erupted over a viral video that showed a mob swarming a screaming woman in Mansura, north of Cairo. Sexual harassment is so widespread that a 2013 United Nations study found that nearly all Egyptian women — 99 percent of those surveyed — had been victims of it. The action against Mr. Zaki was all the more startling because it was led by a government better known for jailing women it accuses of immoral or insolent behavior, an indication of how far Egypt still has to go. “This is another step in a movement that has been building for years,” said Mozn Hassan, one of Egypt’s most outspoken feminists. “I’m so proud of it.” But she acknowledged that Egypt lags behind many countries in protecting the rights of women. Although sexual harassment was criminalized in 2014, rape convictions are still notoriously difficult to obtain, she said. The government has recently jailed women on what rights groups call spurious charges, including the editor of an independent news website, a famous belly dancer, a translator at the renowned Bibliotheca Alexandrina and a woman from a prominent family of activists. Since April, seven young Egyptian women have been imprisoned for posting innocuous dance videos to the social media platform TikTok that prosecutors say offend public morals. The criminal case against Mr. Zaki centers on accusations of rape, blackmail and indecent assault by six women, according to the prosecutor general. Mr. Zaki also faces potential prosecution in Spain, where a business school in Barcelona that he enrolled in last year announced that it had expelled him and, on Monday, filed a criminal complaint with the Spanish police. Mr. Zaki has not publicly addressed the accusations but the prosecutor-general said Monday that he had denied most of them. A prominent television host who said he had spoken with Mr. Zaki’s father, a telecommunications executive, also said that Mr. Zaki rejected the allegations. The wave of outrage against Mr. Zaki was invigorated by his status as a member of Egypt’s elite. After graduating from the American International School, one of the most expensive high schools in Cairo, he attended the American University in Cairo starting in 2016, where fellow students say that he quickly gained a reputation for bad behavior toward women. As a freshman, he was pushed out of the college salsa club after numerous women complained of harassment, said Kareem Elhosseni, who was then vice president of the club. According to several accounts posted in the past week, Mr. Zaki used numerous ruses to gain women’s phone numbers, sometimes claiming to belong to social clubs that did not exist. He pressured women to provide intimate photos that he later used to coerce them into sex, threatening to send the images to their parents if the women refused. Or he “attracted their sympathy by claiming he was going through a crisis,” the prosecutor said, then lured them to his home in a gated community where he sexually assaulted them. One accuser, an 18-year-old woman he met on Tinder, said he seemed like “a decent guy.” But the conversation quickly turned to demands that she come to his house to perform sex acts. When she refused, he showered her with insults and threatened to go to her parents. “When you take it out of context, he sounds delusional,” she said. “But in the moment you believe it. That’s what’s scary.” “None of these women knew each other, but their stories had a lot of similarities,” said Sabah Khodir, an Egyptian writer based in the United States who has written about sexual abuse and who received testimony from several women about Mr. Zaki. But the extent of the accusations only became evident after the Instagram page, @assaultpolice, went public on July 1, eliciting dozens of new accounts, many of them backed by copies of voice and text messages sent by Mr. Zaki. Four of the accusers were European students and one was an American. The page’s administrator, who comes from the same social circle as Mr. Zaki and is roughly his age, said she had confidence in the accounts she posted because she knows the families of many of those making the accusations. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared legal action by Mr. Zaki’s family. The New York Times was unable to independently verify any of the accusations. Mr. Zaki dropped out of the American university, enrolling in an online program at the EU Business School in Barcelona last year. He moved there in February to take a semester on campus. On Friday, the school expelled him, said Claire Basterfield, a spokeswoman for the business school. On Monday, its lawyers filed a 54-page criminal complaint with the Spanish police based on accusations from some of Mr. Zaki’s fellow students in Spain. “It’s important to protect our students,” Ms. Basterfield said. “We need the police to investigate.” The quick action by the Spanish school has drawn scrutiny of the response of the American University to similar complaints about Mr. Zaki. Ms. Khodir, the Egyptian writer, said that there had been numerous accusations about Mr. Zaki from fellow students during his time at the university, culminating in a formal sexual harassment complaint in 2018. A spokeswoman for the American University, Rehab Saad, declined to discuss the complaint against Mr. Zaki, citing confidentiality concerns, saying only that he left the university in 2018 without completing his degree. Ms. Saad added that the university has “a zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment” and that it “strictly complies with Egyptian law on gender harassment, as in all matters.” In an email to staff on Tuesday, the university’s president, Francis J. Ricciardone, pledged to “redouble our training and communications programs” on anti-harassment measures. Egypt has had other “Me Too” moments, though their effects have been ephemeral. In June 2019, several women accused Amr Warda, a national soccer player, of sexual harassment, leading to his suspension from the squad. But he was reinstated after two days, reportedly after pressure from other players. The furor intensified when Mohammed Salah, Egypt’s revered soccer star, said Mr. Warda should be given a second chance and not “sent to the guillotine.” Last November, prosecutors dropped all charges against a 15-year-old girl, Amira Ahmed, who had confessed to killing a bus driver as he attempted to rape her at knife-point. The case was considered a victory for a woman’s right to self-defense, and helped change the public perception of violence against women. Still, the intense focus on Mr. Zaki, who has been remanded in custody until July 21, has opened a new front in the fight for women’s rights, albeit one that is overlaid with complex social divisions. Some Egyptian commentators have contrasted the lionization of Mr. Zaki’s accusers with the treatment of the seven women jailed for posting TikTok videos. While those accusing Mr. Zaki come from wealthy and often influential families, the TikTok women are largely from working or middle-class backgrounds where conservative gender codes are strictly enforced. “It’s about framing,” said Ms. Hassan, the activist. “The authorities want to send a signal that there are good women and bad women. They support the good ones if they are victims. But these TikTok women — they are bad.” Nada Rashwan contributed reporting.']","In a country where women are often blamed when they are sexually assaulted, the arrest of an Egyptian student has raised hopes for changing attitudes."
Seoul Mayor Is Found Dead After Harassment Complaint Is Filed,2020-07-09,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The mayor of Seoul, the country’s second-most powerful official and a potential presidential candidate, was found dead just days after a secretary in his office told the police that he had sexually harassed her since 2017, the authorities said on Friday. A Seoul police officer confirmed early Friday that the body of the mayor, Park Won-soon, had been discovered on a hill in northern Seoul, several hours after his daughter had reported him missing.  Word of the mayor’s death and its possible links to sexual misconduct sent shock waves across the country, not only because Mr. Park was a political star but also because he had long been seen as a champion of women’s rights. His positions stood out in a country where men dominate society’s upper echelons, enforcing a strictly hierarchical code that analysts say makes women vulnerable to abuse and forces its victims to stay silent. Mr. Park, 64, had canceled his official schedule and called in sick to City Hall on Thursday, the day after the secretary had filed her complaint. His daughter told the police that he had left home after leaving a cryptic, “will-like message,” according to Yonhap, the national news agency, which cited an anonymous police source. That detail immediately fueled speculation that Mr. Park could have taken his own life. The discovery of Mr. Park’s body came after nearly 600 police officers and emergency medical workers, aided by police dogs, searched the hills in northern Seoul, where his cellphone signal had last been detected. Mr. Park left his home in a taxi on Thursday morning and got out at a park several minutes later, said Choi Ik-su, a senior detective at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, citing closed-circuit footage. Mr. Park’s body was found in a wooded hill behind the park with the help of a police dog, Mr. Choi said. The police found no suicide note at the scene, he said, but there was also no sign that Mr. Park had been killed by someone else. Hundreds of Mr. Park’s supporters  — some tearfully shouting “We love you, Park Won-soon!” — gathered on Friday in front of Seoul National University Hospital, where his body had been taken for an autopsy. Mr. Park, who was serving his third term as mayor of Seoul, a city of 10 million, had often been cited as a possible successor to President Moon Jae-in, whose single five-year term is set to expire in 2022. Mr. Park’s mayoral term had been scheduled to end in 2022. Before becoming mayor, Mr. Park was a prominent human rights attorney who founded the country’s most influential civil rights group. As a lawyer, he won several major cases, including South Korea’s first sexual harassment case. He also campaigned for the rights of so-called comfort women, Korean sex slaves who were lured or forced to work in brothels for the Japanese Army during World War II. During the military dictatorship of the 1980s, Mr. Park helped win the conviction of a police officer who molested a female student activist during an interrogation. In the 1990s, he helped win damages for a teaching assistant at Seoul National University who accused her professor of refusing to rehire her after she protested unwanted sexual advances. It was the first sexual harassment case in South Korean history. In recent years, the #MeToo movement has rippled across South Korea, leading to a series of high-profile cases. Women have come forward with accusations of sexual abuse against an array of prominent men, including theater directors, politicians, professors, religious leaders and a former coach for the national speedskating team. Many of the accused have apologized and resigned from their positions. Several have faced criminal charges. In April, Oh Keo-don, mayor of Busan, South Korea’s second-largest city, admitted to sexual misconduct and resigned after a public servant accused him of sexually assaulting her in his office. In 2018, Ahn Hee-jung, a rising star in President Moon’s governing Democratic Party and a presidential hopeful, stepped down as governor of South Chungcheong Province after his secretary went on television to accuse him of repeatedly sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on rape charges. President Moon has supported the #MeToo movement, but accusations against prominent allies have been particularly disturbing for his governing liberal camp. Mr. Park, Mr. Ahn and Mr. Oh were all considered prominent members of the president’s Democratic Party. Mr. Park and Mr. Ahn had built successful careers as activists who fought for democracy and human rights under the country’s past military dictatorship. Politicians with backgrounds like theirs have long been treated by South Koreans as holding a higher moral ground than their conservative counterparts, many of whom were connected to the dictatorship. Mr. Park helped found the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, one of South Korea’s most powerful civic groups, which campaigned against corrupt ties between politics and big businesses in a country that has been plagued by scandal. He had a reputation for being a tireless critic of inequality and a vocal antagonist of former President Park Geun-hye, supporting huge rallies against her in central Seoul that ultimately led to her impeachment and ouster on corruption charges in 2017. He had also been one of the most aggressive leaders in South Korea in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, taking a series of steps aimed at containing its spread, like shutting down nightclubs. Seoul has reported only 1,390 cases. South Korea has the highest suicide rate among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It has been rare for politicians in South Korea to take their own lives out of public shame. But former President Roh Moo-hyun killed himself amid allegations of corruption against his family in 2009. Another popular liberal politician, Roh Hoe-chan, also killed himself in 2018 when he faced allegations of corruption.']","Mayor Park Won-soon, who vanished after leaving a cryptic message for his daughter, had faced a newly filed complaint from his secretary."
"Japan Flooding Deaths Rise to 58, With More Rain on Horizon",2020-07-08,By The New York Times,"['For more than a week, Japan has been battered by floods driven by torrential rains, spurring widespread evacuations and the deaths of at least 58 people by Wednesday. Many people remained missing. Tens of thousands of troops, police officers and other rescue workers have been mobilized to work their way through mud and debris in the hardest-hit towns along the Kuma River — known as the “raging river” because it is joined by another river just upstream and often floods — in Japan’s southernmost main island, Kyushu. More flooding and landslides were expected on Wednesday as the rains, some of the heaviest the country has experienced in decades, moved into central Japan. There were reports of swollen rivers, mudslides and damaged homes and roads in two mountainous central prefectures as the authorities issued emergency warnings. NHK television footage showed swollen water in the Hida River tearing into the embankment and destroying a national highway. In southern Japan, the death toll continued to rise as rescue workers performed more search-and-rescue operations. The authorities lowered rainfall warnings for the region but said the threat of further flooding and mudslides remained. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said that 49 victims had come from riverside towns in Kumamoto Prefecture. Another victim, a woman in her 80s, was found inside her flooded home in a different prefecture. An older woman told the public broadcaster, NHK, that she had started walking down the road to evacuate, but that floodwaters had risen quickly to her neck. Another woman said, “I was almost washed away and had to grab an electrical pole.” Soldiers have used boats to rescue residents as floodwaters flowed down streets. Footage from Fukuoka Prefecture showed troops wading through knee-high water pulling a boat carrying a mother, her 2-month-old baby and two other residents. “Good job!” one soldier could be heard saying, according to The Associated Press, as he held the baby against his chest while the mother got off the boat. Several children wearing orange life vests over their wet T-shirts arrived on another boat. In Kuma village in Kumamoto Prefecture, dozens of residents took shelter under a roofed structure in a park with no walls or floor. The village office’s electricity and communications were cut. Among the fatalities were 14 residents of a nursing home next to the Kuma River. When its embankment collapsed, water gushed into the nursing home. More than three million residents were advised to evacuate across Kyushu, Japan’s third-largest island, but it was unclear how many did. In Gero, a man washed down mud at the entrance of his riverside house despite the evacuation advisory. “I was told to run away and my neighbors all went, but I stayed,” he said, according to The A.P. “I didn’t want my house to be washed away in my absence.” The Land Ministry recorded at least 71 landslides across 12 prefectures, according to Kyodo News. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would double rescue and relief personnel to 80,000. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga urged residents to use caution: “Disasters may happen even with little rain where grounds have loosened from previous rainfalls.” Some companies in the region have temporarily halted operations, with the automakers Toyota and Mazda and the electronics conglomerate Panasonic pausing operations at certain plants on Monday because of heavy rain, according to Reuters. Disasters are common during Japan’s rainy season. In July 2018, more than 200 people, about half of them in the Hiroshima area, died from heavy rain and flooding in southwestern Japan. The country is also prone to being hit by typhoons: About 100 people died last October when Typhoon Hagibis, the largest storm to reach Japan in decades, struck the country’s northeast. Climatologists say the problem of heavy storms has been exacerbated by global warming.']","Tens of thousands of troops, police officers and other rescue workers have worked their way through mud and debris in the hardest-hit riverside towns to evacuate residents."
Philippine Congress Officially Shuts Down Leading Broadcaster,2020-07-10,By Jason Gutierrez,"['MANILA — Philippine lawmakers on Friday formally shut down the country’s largest broadcast network, the latest major blow against the news media as President Rodrigo Duterte cracks down on outlets that have been critical of his leadership. After 13 hearings, a committee of the House of Representatives — most of whose members are allied with Mr. Duterte — voted by an overwhelming majority to deny ABS-CBN’s application for renewal of its broadcast franchise. The network had been forced off the air in May, after the franchise expired. “We remain committed to public service, and we hope to find other ways to achieve our mission,” said Carlo Katigbak, ABS-CBN’s president and chief executive, in a statement on Friday. He said the network was “deeply hurt.”  The president’s spokesman, Harry Roque, sought to distance Mr. Duterte from the decision. “The palace has maintained a neutral stance on the issue as it respects the separation of powers between the two coequal branches of government,” he said. “Much as we want to work with the aforesaid media network, we have to abide by the resolution of the House committee.” Mr. Duterte has accused ABS-CBN of bias, including favoring a political opponent in the 2016 election, and had earlier warned that he would not allow the renewal of its franchise.  The president’s critics say he has gone after media outlets that closely documented his drug war, which has left thousands of people dead since he took office in 2016. ABS-CBN ceased operations of its free TV and radio channels by government order after its 25-year franchise expired in May. ABS-CBN still operates a cable channel and internet sites, but the company has told its 11,000 employees that they could be let go by August if its broadcast franchise was not renewed.  After the network went off the air, there was a backlash from millions of Filipinos who rely on it for news, forcing the lower house of Congress to rush hearings on the franchise renewal. The government has accused ABS-CBN of illegally operating a cable channel, as well as hiding behind what it called a “corporate veil” that allowed foreign investors to own part of the firm. ABS-CBN has denied the allegations. Fourteen lawmakers who sponsored bills backing the network argued that the hearings had not proven that ABS-CBN broke any regulations that warranted its closure. “Seventy million Filipinos tune to its programs weekly,” they said in a joint statement. “Now more than ever, in the time of a pandemic, we need a vibrant and independent source of information and news to tell the people what is going on.” Nonoy Espina, who heads the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, said that lawmakers who were seeking to block the franchise renewal had “gripes” to settle. By voting to shut down ABS-CBN, Mr. Espina said, the House “has lost all claim to represent the people and our interests.”  The congressional hearings did shine a light on some shortcomings of big media networks, including unfair labor practices and a lack of self-regulation, analysts said. “But legislators have no business to say how media should operate,” said Danilo Arao, a journalism professor at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. ABS-CBN, he said, “is being singled out.” Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, called the decision a “grievous assault on press freedom,” adding, “This move solidifies the tyranny of President Rodrigo Duterte.” The Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines said it was a “profoundly dark day for journalists.” As the leading broadcaster in the country, ABS-CBN was known for its prime time flagship news program, “TV Patrol,” as well as soap operas and afternoon variety TV shows. Along with the online news site Rappler, ABS-CBN has been at the forefront of coverage of Mr. Duterte’s violent drug war. Recently, a Manila court convicted Rappler’s chief executive, Maria Ressa, and a former staff writer of cyberlibel. Ms. Ressa, an award-winning former CNN journalist, is out on bail while the case is on appeal, but she could face up to six years in prison. Mr. Duterte has often gone after members of the press that he dislikes. He has called journalists “sons of bitches” and warned that they were not exempt from the possibility of physical attacks.  He has accused Rappler of being funded by the Central Intelligence Agency, though he has never offered evidence for that. This week, he accused Ms. Ressa of being a “fraud” and said a new case could be filed against her. He did not elaborate.']","By voting not to renew the franchise of ABS-CBN, lawmakers silenced a major network that had come under fire from President Rodrigo Duterte."
"In a Death, Details of More Russian Murder-for-Hire Plots",2020-07-09,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — Earlier this year, a heavyset man living in Vienna and known as Martin Beck said during a TV interview that he was assisting an investigation of a complicated murder-for-hire plot, in which three people were to be killed in exchange for $2 million. He described a blood-splattered world of contract killings for revenge and politics, of a type that seems to exist only in moviemakers’ fantasies — and in Russia. Now, associates of Mr. Beck say his murder over the weekend, which he claimed to know was coming and carried a $5 million reward, lends credence to his account of operating as an informant on a group of assassins from the Russian region of Chechnya. Ihor Mosiychuk, a former member of Ukraine’s Parliament and one of the three targets of the plot Mr. Beck described, said in an interview that he had met with Mr. Beck and found him credible. “The materials that he gave to me and the police fully conformed with the events that occurred,” he said. In the fateful interview, Mr. Beck said he had for years been cooperating with the Ukrainian and Austrian secret services to inform on officials in the Chechen regional government who he said ordered contract murders in Europe and Ukraine. The interview was posted online in February by the Ukrainian television station Svobodny. Born Mamikhan Umarov in Chechnya and known by a variety of aliases, Mr. Beck told the station that he had fought against Russia in the post-Soviet wars in Chechnya and received a new identity as an asylum seeker in Austria more than a decade ago. Ukraine’s national police and the country’s domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., declined to comment on the killing of Mr. Beck, as did the authorities in Austria, who have said they arrested two ethnic Chechens in connection with the shooting on July 4 outside Vienna. In a statement posted online Thursday, the iron-fisted and Kremlin-allied Chechen leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, denied any role in the killing and blamed unspecified Western security services. “The sellout mouthpieces receive money for their work and are then killed as supposedly innocent victims,” he wrote. Organized-crime style contract murders were rampant in Russia’s business circles in the early post-Soviet period. In recent years, however, the rising incidence of contract killings by Russians outside the country is raising alarms. American intelligence agencies are investigating whether Russia has paid bounties to the Taliban or criminal groups for attacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan. Speaking anonymously, intelligence officials have said $500,000 in cash was found at the house in Kabul of a possible intermediary, who was thought to have fled to Russia to avoid arrest. In 2006, Russia legalized the targeted killing of “terrorist” suspects abroad under authorizations that Russian officials like to compare to the legal justifications for American drone strikes. Russia has never publicly acknowledged using the authority granted under the law. While Ukrainian officials have for years accused Russia of conducting strikes against military officers and members of paramilitary groups active in the war in eastern Ukraine, there is no direct evidence tying the Kremlin to these schemes. In his February interview, Mr. Beck identified the three targets of the plot as a commander, a deputy commander and a sniper in Ukrainian paramilitary groups fighting Russian-backed rebels. Two of them were Chechens, and therefore considered turncoats, and the third, Mr. Mosiychuk, had insulted the Chechen leader, Mr. Kadyrov, in a video posted online. Mr. Beck said he learned of the affair because an official of the Chechen regional government, unaware that Mr. Beck was an informant, had asked him to act as a middleman in arranging the killings, and that he had recorded the conversations. Svobodny published several of the recordings, in which there is some haggling over the price. At one point, a man speaking in Chechen with Mr. Beck says of the three targets in Ukraine, “If they get worked over, it would be very good.” Elements of the story are unclear, including why the intended victims were not warned in advance. But one thing is certain: All three people were targeted. Under the guise of a foreign correspondent for the French newspaper Le Monde, one assassin, identified as Artur Denisultanov-Kurmakayev, arranged to interview two of them: the commander of the Dzhokhar Dudayev paramilitary group, Adam Osmayev, and his wife, Amina Okuyeva, who was a sniper. In that attempt in Kyiv in June 2017, Mr. Osmayev was wounded before Ms. Okuyeva shot and wounded the fake journalist. Mr. Denisultanov-Kurmakayev was detained but traded to Russia last year by President Volodymyr Zelensky for captured Ukrainian spies. Mr. Denisultanov-Kurmakayev had also asked for an interview with Mr. Mosiychuk, who was deputy commander of the nationalist Azov paramilitary group as well as a Member of Parliament. But he had brushed off the request by suggesting the reporter speak to his press secretary instead. That October, the attacks resumed. An assailant with a machine gun hiding in the bushes near a railway crossing outside of Kyiv sprayed the car of Mr. Osmayev and Ms. Okuyeva, killing Ms. Okuyeva. Also that month, a remote-controlled bomb attached to a parked motorcycle on a Kyiv street exploded near Mr. Mosiychuk, wounding him and killing a bodyguard and a bystander. In the TV interview, Mr. Beck said he had helped the Ukrainian authorities identify a courier delivering payments from Chechnya to Europe for contract murders, a lead that could shed light on a string of murders in the Chechen diaspora in Europe. Last August, an assassin riding a bicycle and armed with a silenced pistol shot and killed a former rebel commander, Zelimkhan Khangushvili, in the Kleiner Tiergarten park in Berlin. Police arrested the killer after he threw his gun and a wig in a river. German officials said they suspected Russia was behind the killing, which Moscow denied, and expelled two Russian diplomats in retaliation. In January, a Chechen exile and critic of Mr. Kadyrov, Imran Aliyev, was stabbed 130 times and died in his hotel room in Lille, France. Prosecutors say a suspect escaped to Russia. A few weeks later, a Chechen blogger, Tumso Abdurakhmanov, who is critical of Mr. Kadyrov, said he had fought off and subdued an assailant with a hammer who had sneaked into his home in Gavle, Sweden. Mr. Abdurakhmanov made and posted a video showing him questioning the man immediately after the fight, demanding to know who had sent him. The man and a woman, both Russian, were arrested in connection with the attack. Why Mr. Beck decided to go public with his tale, when the consequences seemed so lethal, is not entirely clear. Mr. Mosiychuk said Mr. Beck was motivated by a blood feud with the Chechen leader, Mr. Kadyrov, whom he blamed for the death of his brother. “All Chechens who went through the war live in a terrifying world,” he said. “It’s a complicated situation.” Mr. Beck said in the interview that his relations with Ukraine’s police were fraying, suggesting he could no longer count on their support. It is also conceivable that, if Mr. Beck knew he was being stalked, as he claimed, he might have thought that the glare of publicity was his best defense. Asked if the price on his own life seemed high or reasonable, Mr. Mosiychuk said it seemed high but, “How should I know? I don’t order killings.” Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.']",A Chechen man shot near Vienna last weekend had spoken publicly of giving Austrian and Ukrainian authorities information about contract killings. He also said there was a price on his head.
"Thailand Moves to Legalize Same-Sex Unions, a Rare Step in Asia",2020-07-09,By Hannah Beech,"['BANGKOK — In a country that has long been a rare bastion in Asia for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, Thailand said on Wednesday that it had approved a draft bill that would give same-sex unions many of the same benefits as those of heterosexual marriages. The bill, approved by the cabinet, avoids the term “marriage” but allows for the legal registration of same-sex partnerships. Accompanying amendments to the civil code would give couples the right to jointly own property, adopt children and pass on inheritances. Civil partnerships must occur between individuals who are at least 17 years old. At least one of the pair must be a Thai citizen. “The Civil Partnership Bill is a milestone for Thai society in promoting equality among people of all genders,” said Ratchada Dhnadirek, a deputy government spokeswoman. “This strengthens the families of people with sexual diversity and is appropriate for the present social circumstances.” While the bill still needs to be passed by Parliament to become law, social activists say that the biggest hurdle was approval by Thailand’s cabinet, which is a stronghold of retired military generals and tradition-bound political elders. Although some elements of the Buddhist-dominated culture in Thailand are socially conservative, the country is also one of the most open places in the world for L.G.B.T.Q. people. Thai surgeons have been pioneers in gender-reassignment surgery, and schools in rural Thailand have provided separate bathrooms for transgender students. Hit soap operas chronicle gay relationships. And four transgender people were elected to Parliament last year. Yet discrimination persists, with gay and transgender individuals often encouraged to enter certain fields like entertainment or fashion. Rights activists say that the welcoming attitude toward gay tourists may not be as pervasive toward Thais themselves. If the civil partnership bill is approved by Parliament, Thailand will join Taiwan as the only places in Asia that provide elements of legal equality for same-sex couples. Taiwan’s legislature passed a same-sex marriage law last year. The Thai bill is not as expansive as that of Taiwan. Same-sex couples in Thailand will not be able to enjoy certain tax breaks. And critics of the bill say that calling such unions civil partnerships, rather than marriage, is a cop out. “The foundation of the same-sex union law draft isn’t based on equality,” said Pauline Ngarmpring, who is transgender and who ran for prime minister last year. “But it’s better than nothing,” she added. “This is not a fight that can be finished in our generation.” Ms. Pauline, a former sports promoter, noted that she was still identified as male on her Thai identity card and must use male facilities at public hospitals. In Malaysia, Singapore and other Asian nations, gay sex is a criminal offense. Brunei last year enacted laws calling for death by stoning for gay sex and adultery, but after an international outcry, the nation’s sultan said that capital punishment had not been carried out for decades and that the moratorium on the death penalty would continue. This year, a judge in Singapore rejected efforts to overturn rarely enforced colonial-era legislation that could lead to up to two years’ imprisonment for consensual sexual relations between two men. India repealed a similar section of its penal code in 2018.

Used Clothes Ban May Crimp Kenyan Style. It May Also Lift Local Design.,2020-07-09,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Catherine Muringo’s wardrobe consists of secondhand outfits shipped from all over the world: colorful blouses and jeans from Canada, floral dresses from the United States, trench coats from Australia and leather handbags from the United Kingdom. For years, Ms. Muringo bought the used clothes and accessories at cheap prices in open-air markets in Nairobi and used them to fashion her own idiosyncratic style. Seven years ago, she also started a business buying and selling such items, distributing castoff fur coats, hoodies and shoes to customers in Kenya and in foreign markets like Botswana, Uganda and Tanzania. But in late March, the Kenyan government banned the importation of used garments in what it said was a precautionary measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Even though used clothes are fumigated before being shipped, Kenyan authorities said they were taking precautions because of the spike in infections in countries like the United States. Now, businesses like hers are threatened, as well as the sartorial choices of millions of Kenyans who depend on low-cost imports to stay stylish. “Kenyans love to go to the secondhand markets and spend hours looking and searching,” Ms. Muringo said. “Kenyans love the diversity of secondhand.” Officials also said the banning of imported clothing — known as mitumba, the Swahili word for “bundles” — could have an unexpected benefit. It could help Kenya revive its own textile industry, which was wiped out in the late 1980s as the country started opening its markets to foreign competition. “I think corona has shown not just for Kenya but for many countries to look inward a lot and try and fill some of the market gaps,” said Phyllis Wakiaga, the chief executive of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. “The reality is that there’s a big opportunity for us to produce local clothes for the citizens.” For years, Kenya, along with other countries in East Africa, had tried to phase out used clothing to boost local manufacturing. But the countries faced the threat of being removed from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which promotes trade by providing reduced or duty-free access to the American market. Many countries backed off from instituting a ban on imported clothing, with the exception of Rwanda. The coronavirus gave Kenya a chance to promote its own clothing manufacturing, but thwarted a lively trade. In Nairobi, the combination of the import ban, plus lockdown measures and an overnight curfew introduced to stamp out the virus, have drastically lessened the hive of activity at the popular Gikomba and Toi thrift markets, mazes of narrow pathways packed with bellowing vendors and piles of clothes, shoes and household goods. As the largest importer of used clothing in East Africa, Kenya, with its new ban, is expected to upend not just supply chains but also lead to a hemorrhage in jobs connected to the trade and the loss of millions of dollars from government coffers as tax revenue and import duties fall. But where some see problems, others see opportunity. Wagura Kamwana, the proprietor of a fabric shop, the Textile Loft, is seeking to capitalize on this moment. Ms. Kamwana, 40, grew up wearing hand-stitched clothes from her mother, and later on, sought trendy outfits at secondhand markets. Kenyans like used clothes, she said, both for their affordability and because of the their high-quality fabrics. In 2016, she opened her store, offering premium quality fabrics, sourced from Europe, to Kenyans who wanted to create high-end fashion locally. In 2018, she started also offering production services to designers looking to develop smaller lines who were being turned away by factories only interested in bulk orders. Ms. Kamwana has already worked with prominent local designers like Katungulu Mwendwa. The pandemic has also offered the chance to start her own clothing line. Her new label is set to produce everyday clothing for women including dresses, scarves and trousers ranging from $25 to $150. Ms. Kamwana said designers and manufacturers should collaborate and take baby steps to push the industry toward maturity. “This whole value chain will take quite a few years to be feasible or to be seen,” she said, adding, “what we can do immediately is perfect our art of making.” Other Kenyan companies are also responding to the challenges posed by the pandemic by focusing locally. Frederick Bittiner Wear, which does fabric selection, design and tailoring for retailers in East Africa, Europe and the United States, has seen a reduction in orders because of the pandemic, so it has turned to producing leggings, T-shirts and vests for the local market, said Dominic Agesa, the managing director. After approaching distributors with samples, Mr. Agesa said he got 50 orders in a week. For too long, “Kenya has been reluctant” to incentivize local manufacturers, he said, but the import ban was one step toward making conditions more favorable for a local scene to eventually flourish. “Are we able to satisfy the Kenyan market and beyond? Mr. Agesa said. “Gradually, the answer is yes.” Suave Kenya is a brand that transforms secondhand clothes ranging from silk shirts to leather jackets into stylish and colorful tote bags, backpacks and wallets. With the import ban, its founder, Mohamed Awale, is looking into sourcing from local tanneries and textile factories. “If the pandemic persists, we will have to adapt while still producing the type of bright bags that make us unique,” said Mr. Awale, 32. “When we source locally, we create jobs and make our industries grow.” Nowhere is the shift to adapt to the changes brought on by the pandemic more visible than in the special export zones on Nairobi’s outskirts. Established in 1990, these zones offer companies less regulations plus tax incentives to promote export-oriented businesses. But with borders closed and exports plunging, some of the clothing factories have begun servicing the Kenyan market, with the country temporarily allowing manufacturers to exceed the usual limit of supplying no more than 20 percent of their annual production to local markets. Shona EPZ has 500 employees and makes reflective work clothes for companies like 3M and apparel for department stores like T.J. Maxx. But since the pandemic began, the firm has pivoted toward making personal protective equipment for Kenya, producing tens of thousands of masks and surgical gowns per day, said its director, Isaac Maluki. Mr. Maluki said he has also partnered with secondhand importers and small-scale manufacturers, that, with the ban on used clothing, are increasingly considering collaborating with larger companies like his to make clothes for local consumption. “We want to really encourage them to see the kind of quality that comes out of here that can be shared into the local market,” he said. “The local market is huge.” But before a robust clothing sector takes hold, experts say local manufacturers will have to overcome a host of challenges, including inadequate access to finance, the high cost of electricity, and the lack of raw materials, including cotton. The fact that powerful lobby groups for the secondhand clothing industry in the United States have already criticized Kenya’s move doesn’t bode well either, said Emily Anne Wolff, a researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands who has studied plans to phase out used clothing in East Africa. Kenya is aiming to be the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States, which could undermine Kenya’s will to retain the clothing ban. Used clothes traders have appealed to the government in recent days to lift the ban, saying there is no public health risk associated with the trade. But officials have so far ruled that option out. For now, Kenyan designers and manufacturers say the ban gives them a window of opportunity to start shaping the future of fashion in Kenya. “Now is a good time to make choices and changes,” said Ms. Kamwana, the owner of Textile Loft. “You will be surprised by what comes out of this country.”']","Kenya has halted imports of secondhand clothes to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

"The Killing of Qassim Suleimani Was Unlawful, Says U.N. Expert",2020-07-09,By Nick Cumming-Bruce,"['GENEVA — A United Nations expert investigating summary executions said on Thursday that the United States’ targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran was unlawful and risked eroding international laws that govern the conduct of hostilities. Agnes Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur investigating extrajudicial and summary executions, said that the American drone strike that killed General Suleimani as he arrived in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in January could only be justified in international law as a response to an imminent threat. The United States had provided no evidence to support that position, she said. “Absent an actual imminent threat to life, the course of action taken by the U.S. was unlawful,” Ms. Callamard wrote in a report that she presented on Thursday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. The retaliatory missile attacks Iran launched against American bases in Iraq five days later were also “completely outside the scope of what is permissible” in international law, Ms. Callamard said. Ms. Callamard’s report as a United Nations independent expert is intended as an international wake-up call that will help to generate critical scrutiny and action on issues hitherto debated mainly by academics, lawyers and security experts. There is an urgent need for international action to monitor and regulate the use of drones and the threat they pose to international law, Ms. Callamard said. In the absence of a clear legal framework for holding states accountable for drone strikes, she called for the U.N. Security Council to review all targeted killings and for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit annual reports on drone strike casualties. In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned Ms. Callamard’s report as “spurious” and said that it “gives more cause to distrust U.N. human rights mechanisms.”  General Suleimani commanded Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the military that ran clandestine operations across the Middle East and was designated by President Trump as a foreign terrorist organization in April 2019. President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said they ordered the strike in response to an imminent threat of attack but provided no evidence in official explanations to Congress and the United Nations. In a memo to Congress, the administration said only that it carried out the strike as a response to previous Iranian attacks and “to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces and interests.” The information that Trump administration officials provided was “remarkably vague and inconsequential as far as a possible imminent threat is concerned,” Ms. Callamard wrote in the report. “Even at the most basic level, the U.S. did not demonstrate that striking Suleimani was ‘necessary.’” Instead, she said, the United States strike on General Suleimani set an alarming precedent for the use of drones in targeted killings. Until January, such strikes had been limited to individuals in nonstate groups. Ms. Callamard said that the United States attack on General Suleimani was the first targeted drone killing of a senior foreign government official on the territory of a third country. “It is hard to imagine that a similar strike against a Western military leader would not be considered as an act of war,” she wrote. As a result of the killing, the international community faced “the very real prospect that states may opt to ‘strategically’ eliminate high ranking military officials outside the context of a ‘known’ war, and seek to justify the killing on the grounds of the target’s classification as a ‘terrorist’ who posed a potential future threat,” Ms. Callamard said in her report. “If you have a few more countries moving in that direction, the real risks of global conflagration are becoming very high,” she told reporters in Geneva. “There are no red lines.” Ms. Callamard presented her findings on the killing of General Suleimani as a case study illustrating the wider dangers posed by what she called the “extremely scary” unregulated growth in the use of armed drones and the dramatic escalation of their capabilities. The armed forces of at least 102 countries now operated drones, she said, along with at least 20 nonstate actors, including the Islamic State and the Libyan militia led by General Khalifa Hifter. Around 40 states possessed or were procuring armed drones, and at least 11 countries had used drones for military strikes, including targeted killings. Ms. Callamard also attacked the notion that armed drones enabled precise, surgical strikes as “a myth,” citing the heavy civilian casualties inflicted in the course of drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen, often as a result of faulty intelligence. Ms. Callamard said that analysis of classified data on American drone strikes in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011 found they were ten times more likely to cause civilian casualties than conventional air attacks. Data from Pakistan in 2015 indicated that missed strikes on 24 individuals had killed more than 870 other people.

The Man Striving to Be the ‘Canadian Obama’,2020-07-10,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — For Balarama Holness, the defining moment of his life happened four years before he was born. It was at a Bob Marley concert in Montreal, when the eyes of his Québécois mother and his Jamaican father interlocked as the singer wailed, “Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights!” It was the final year of the freewheeling 1970s, and his adventurous Francophone mother and ascetic Anglophone father were strangers in a sprawling hockey arena. But Mr. Holness said barriers of language and race momentarily collapsed as the Marley anthem washed over the crowd — a rare alchemy that he said he had spent his whole life chasing. “The music dissolved fictitious divisions in society,” Mr. Holness said, “and somewhere between the dreadlocks, the Jamaican patois and Québécois French, the seeds of my existence were sowed, along with my future as a rebel.” Educator, broadcaster, law student and former championship-winning professional Canadian football player, Mr. Holness, 36, aspires to be a “Canadian Obama” — another “biracial lawyer,” he observes, who cut his teeth as a community organizer. His other role model is Colin Kaepernick, the Black quarterback whose kneeling during the American national anthem before N.F.L. games became a potent symbol against racial and social injustice. Mr. Holness’s outsized swagger and ambition are perhaps inevitable — he noted that because of his parents’ respect for Hindu tradition, they named him Balarama, considered by some a god with extraordinary strength. A first cousin, Andrew Holness, is Jamaica’s prime minister. In Balarama Holness’s case, he has grabbed Canadian headlines after mobilizing a grass-roots movement over the past two years that pushed Montreal’s City Hall to hold hearings on systemic racism. That is no small accomplishment in Quebec, a French-majority province where the government has repeatedly denied the existence of systemic racism. Over 12 months, 7,000 people testified or made submissions for the inquiry, which published a damning report last month concluding that City Hall was turning a blind eye to racial profiling by the police. It also took City Hall to task for the fact that nonwhite people accounted for only 6 percent of the city’s 103 elected officials. After the report, Quebec’s premier, François Legault, appointed two Black ministers to lead an anti-racism task force, while Mr. Holness has become a go-to advocate at Canadian universities, civic events and government ministries. David Lametti, Canada’s minister of justice and attorney general, who has sought out Mr. Holness for advice, recalled that Mr. Holness had grilled him amiably on his radio show. During the interview, he implored the minister to consider when making policy that Black people were disproportionately imprisoned by the criminal justice system. “He wasn’t easy on me — he is smart without being overbearing,” Mr. Lametti said. “I see him as a national leader. We need his voice.” Greg Fergus, the chair of the Black caucus in Canada’s Parliament, credited Mr. Holness with helping engender a “national reckoning” on race. Mr. Holness observed that while Canada has sought to portray itself as a progressive, liberal bastion, the reality is far more sinister, with Indigenous people subjugated, Black residents in Toronto 20 times as likely to be killed by the police than white residents, and historical amnesia. He met his partner, Darnella Torelli, an international development student, after spotting her while collecting signatures on a Montreal street. They gave their 11-month-old daughter the middle name Angélique, after Marie Joseph Angélique, a 29-year-old enslaved woman who fought for liberty and was tortured and hanged after being accused in 1734 of burning down a Montreal neighborhood. When he began his quest to fight systemic racism, Mr. Holness recalled, some Quebecers vilified him and accused him of “playing the victim,” while some veteran activists dismissed him as a cocky upstart. But he said the global uprising for Black rights spurred by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis had elevated his own voice and ambitions. “The abuse of power has plagued brown and Black people, and we have had enough,” Mr. Holness said. His own egalitarian spirit took hold early, after his parents separated and his mother took him and his baby twin brother to live in a Hindu ashram in West Virginia. He ate communal meals, meditated daily and said he had little consciousness of his ethnicity or skin color. He said his tenacity was honed at age 9, when he entered the ashram’s dome-like sweat lodge, where members went to pray, and suddenly found himself in total darkness, frightened, panicked and unable to breathe. “I realized for the first time I could harness my mind to master my fear,” he said. But his idyllic world was turned upside down at age 10, when his mother moved them from the ashram to a predominantly white suburban neighborhood of Montreal. His mother opened a dance studio, but the family struggled financially. He was reunited with his bookish father, who had renounced material goods and devoted himself full time to a Hindu temple. Mr. Holness recalled that he was eager to fit in. But at his underfunded Francophone public high school, his skin color derailed that plan. “One boy asked me, ‘Why do you have mud on your face?’ Another called me the N-word,’” he said. “For the first time I realized I was different — a brown kid with curly hair, a vegetarian with a funny name.” He added: “One of my teachers even gave me a new name to try and assimilate me: ‘Steven.’ I was too white to be accepted by the Black students and too Black to be accepted by the white students.” Soon, he recalled, he was getting into fist fights, smoking pot and going on alcohol binges. He was randomly carded by the police repeatedly and, on one occasion, shoved into the back of a police car after being accused of loitering. Although he was a talented street basketball player by his late teens, he had never played organized football. Nevertheless, while watching an N.F.L. game on television at 18, he decided to become a professional football player after seeing a defensive back who was 5-foot-11 and 180 pounds, just as he was. He went on to play for the University of Ottawa. He clashed with the team captain and, on one occasion around that time, broke his hand in a fight. But his speed — he could run 40 yards in 4.4 seconds — captured the attention of Canadian Football League scouts. He went on to sign as an undrafted free agent with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and, after that contract expired, signed on with his hometown Montreal Alouettes. Thanks to the discipline of professional football, Mr. Holness said, “the drugs and negative influences shed like dead skin.” In 2010, two months before training camp for the Grey Cup championship, Canada’s equivalent of the Super Bowl, Mr. Holness broke his foot, and doctors told him that his season was over. Fearful that he would lose his place on the team, he kept it to himself and trained despite the pain. He went on to help the Alouettes win the Grey Cup, and still proudly wears his championship ring. “It represented all I had overcome,” he said. But after a series of injuries, he decided to leave professional sports and become a teacher. Devastated after his mother died in 2013 from a viral illness at age 57, he went on the road for two years, living for a time in China. After a stint as a teacher, he applied for law school at McGill, Canada’s most prestigious university, and during his first year as a student there, he ran for mayor of Montreal North, one of the country’s poorest neighborhoods. After losing the election, he accused his left-leaning political party of using nonwhite candidates for public relations but not giving them adequate support to win elections. Some critics called him a sore loser.

Serbia Protests Meet Violent Response in Europe’s 1st Major Virus Unrest,2020-07-09,By Patrick Kingsley,"['Thousands of Serbs demonstrated for a second consecutive night on Wednesday in response to President Aleksandar Vucic’s management of the coronavirus crisis and wider concerns over the state of democracy in Serbia. The protests were the first major pandemic-related unrest in Europe since the start of the crisis, and were met by a violent police response that some analysts said they had not witnessed in Serbia since the rule of Slobodan Milosevic, who governed Serbia during the 1990s. Serbs first took to the streets on Tuesday, soon after Mr. Vucic announced that Belgrade would be placed under a new three-day lockdown following a second wave of confirmed coronavirus infections. But the demonstrations quickly morphed into a wider expression of frustration at Mr. Vucic’s increasing control over policymaking and perceived mismanagement of Serbia’s pandemic response. The protests continued on Wednesday, even after Mr. Vucic suspended his decision to enforce a second shutdown. Protesters said they were less angry about the re-implementation of the lockdown than the governmental missteps that had created the need for renewed restrictions in the first place. These included decisions to proceed with a general election last week and to restart large public sports events. “We don’t mind staying home for another three days — that wasn’t the problem,” said Dragana Grncarski, 45, a fashion events manager who protested on both days. “However, they’re playing with our minds and with the truth,” Ms. Grncarski added. “When it suits them to do elections, there is no corona. They organized football matches and tennis matches, and because of that we have a situation where the hospitals are full.” After initially enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns in March, Mr. Vucic lifted social restrictions in early May, claiming his government had defeated the coronavirus. But while other European countries eased their lockdowns gradually, Mr. Vucic opted for a faster process, soon allowing Serbs to gather by the tens of thousands without social distancing at sports matches and to crowd into reopened nightclubs. “We went from one extreme to another,” said Jelena Vasiljevic, an expert on Balkan protest movements at the University of Belgrade. Mr. Vucic initially refused to change course on the re-openings, even as the daily number of new cases rose from below 20 to above 300 and investigative news reports suggested that the toll could be even higher. He pressed ahead with a controversial general election on June 21 that most opposition parties had long planned to boycott, saying they did not want to legitimize a process that they feel is gamed in Mr. Vucic’s favor. And to Mr. Vucic’s critics, his decision first to ease restrictions ahead of a vote that was certain to increase his power — and then reinstate them soon after — felt like he was playing politics with public health. “Citizens have been constantly deceived and lied to for political ends,” said Tena Prelec, an expert on politics in southeast Europe at the University of Oxford. Analysts said the spontaneous nature of the protests reflected the lack of institutional means to express dissent. Under Mr. Vucic, the quality of Serbian democracy has fallen from “free” to only “partly free,” according to Freedom House, an independent Washington-based watchdog that makes an annual assessment of each country’s political freedoms. “The media and state institutions are completely consumed by one party,” said Dr. Vasiljevic. On Tuesday night, some protesters briefly entered the Parliament building before being forced out by police. Law enforcement officials were later filmed beating unarmed protesters with batons, in scenes that some analysts said mirrored police behavior during the rule of Mr. Milosevic, who led Serbia through the Balkan Wars and was later tried for war crimes in The Hague. “The excessive use of force — we haven’t seen that since Milosevic in 1996 or 1997,” Dr. Vasiljevic said. Mr. Vucic said police were right to respond with force. “There were indications of foreign involvement, and some criminal faces were there, too,” Mr. Vucic said, speaking on Wednesday afternoon, before the second night of protests. “The aim was to damage Serbia’s international image,” he added. The protests could soon fizzle because of their leaderless nature, the lack of a clear goal and the strength of Mr. Vucic’s grip on Serbia, Dr. Vasiljevic said. Similar mass demonstrations dissipated last year without forcing concessions from Mr. Vucic. “This situation is a bit different,” said Dr. Vasiljevic. “But we still need to have some clear political articulations, and a clear political narrative.”']","To counter a second coronavirus wave, President Aleksandar Vucic announced a new lockdown.

Macron Drops Idea of a Modern Spire for Notre-Dame,2020-07-09,By Aurelien Breeden,"['President Emmanuel Macron of France on Thursday dropped the unpopular idea of building a modern spire atop a restored Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, a possibility he had floated after a devastating fire sent the previous spire crashing through the roof. Just days after a blaze tore through the beloved cathedral in April last year, Mr. Macron, surprising many, suggested replacing the lost spire with a “contemporary architectural gesture.” French authorities proposed a prestigious international architectural competition to replace the spire, leading to a flurry of preliminary proposals that ranged from the modern to the madcap, including a beam of light, glass-covered gardens and a 300-foot, carbon-fiber flame. But the idea of a modern spire never caught on with critics or with public opinion, and Mr. Macron never committed to it. Polls showed a majority in favor of restoring the 19th-century spire designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, a French architect who headed a major restoration of the cathedral. The original spire, which stood for five and a half centuries, deteriorated badly and was removed in the 18th century. Mr. Macron’s office said in a statement on Thursday that he had “become convinced” that Notre-Dame had to be restored in a way that was “as true as possible” to its “complete, coherent and last known state.” The presidency also acknowledged that Mr. Macron, who has set a tight, five-year deadline to reopen the cathedral for worship and tourism by 2024, did not want to “delay” or “complicate” the reconstruction with an architectural competition. Instead, the area surrounding the cathedral could be modernized with a “contemporary gesture,” in “close collaboration” with Paris City Hall, Mr. Macron’s office said, without providing details. Jean-Michel Léniaud, a historian and Viollet-le-Duc expert who sits on a council advising the task force in charge of restoring Notre-Dame, expressed satisfaction with the decision. “Notre-Dame is a national and international symbol” that unites people, he said, and departing from its world-famous architecture would have had a “divisive effect.” “Would we paint the White House red, for modernity’s sake?” Mr. Léniaud said. Mr. Macron’s decision came right after the National Heritage and Architecture Commission, an advisory body that handles important restoration projects, unanimously approved recommendations by architects that Notre-Dame be restored to its prior state. That includes rebuilding the spire as designed by Viollet-le-Duc and using original materials like wood for the roofing, in order to “guarantee the authenticity, the harmony and the coherence of this masterpiece of Gothic architecture,” the restoration task force said in a statement on Thursday. The president’s office said that Mr. Macron trusted the commission’s “expertise.” “I am happy that the French, pilgrims and visitors from around the world will once again meet with the cathedral that they love,” Gen. Jean-Louis Georgelin, a former army chief of staff named by Mr. Macron to head the task force, said in the statement. The fire last year destroyed the latticework of huge, ancient timbers that made up Notre-Dame’s attic, melted the roof’s lead sheath and endangered the overall stability of the iconic stone structure that had stood for eight centuries. Molten metal, flaming beams and the spire fell into the cathedral’s interior, doing further damage. Progress toward restoring Notre-Dame has been halting. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, workers had to shore up the building to prevent it from collapsing, but bad weather, worries over lead contamination and the coronavirus pandemic — which led to a temporary shutdown of the site — prevented them from doing much more. Most recently, workers hanging from ropes have started using hand saws to delicately remove about 40,000 pieces of charred, twisted scaffolding — remnants of prior renovations that were melted in the fire. The old scaffolding, which weighs about 200 tons, has to be taken down before the architects can fully assess the state of the building and plan its reconstruction.']",The French president had floated the idea of replacing the fire-ravaged cathedral’s 19th-century spire with a “contemporary architectural gesture.” Few were in favor.
"To ‘Protect Young Minds,’ Hong Kong Moves to Overhaul Schools",2020-07-11,By Amy Qin and Tiffany May,"['Starting this fall, schools in Hong Kong will display colorful new government-issued posters declaring that “freedom comes with responsibilities.” Administrators may now call the police if anyone insults the Chinese national anthem on campus.  Students as young as kindergartners will be taught about a new national security law that gives the authorities the power to squelch opposition to Beijing with heavy prison sentences. After months of antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, China’s ruling Communist Party is reaching into the semiautonomous territory to overhaul an education system that it sees as having given rise to a generation of rebellious youth. The sweeping law Beijing imposed earlier this month also targets Hong Kong’s students, who have been a galvanizing force behind the protests. Carrie Lam, the city’s Beijing-backed leader, said at a forum on Saturday that the arrests of more than 3,000 children and teenagers at protests had exposed how the city’s campuses had been penetrated by forces hostile to the local and central governments. “Faced with such a severe situation with our young people, we can’t help but ask, what is wrong with education in Hong Kong?” she said. Mrs. Lam said the schools’ textbooks, classroom teaching and students’ extracurricular activities reflected negative news media reporting about China and the “wanton discrediting of the government and police.” Educating students about the new law, she said, would help them become more law-abiding.  The party’s goal for the territory is clear: to foster a new generation of loyal and patriotic Hong Kong youth. It is a strategy of ideological control that it has wielded to great effect in the mainland, but could rapidly erode Hong Kong’s reputation for academic freedom. “Young kids will be brought up to understand and believe that without the Chinese Communist Party they have no future, that anything they have is because of the party,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Over the last year, images of students in neatly pressed school uniforms joining hands to form human chains have become among the most evocative symbols of the protest movement. But campuses have also been the site of some of the movement’s most violent scenes, such as at Polytechnic University, where protesters and police officers faced off in a prolonged fight with rubber bullets, firebombs and bows and arrows in November. Now, in forcing through the security law, Beijing has signaled that it has seen enough. On Wednesday, Kevin Yeung, Hong Kong’s education secretary, barred students from singing “Glory to Hong Kong,” a popular protest song, displaying political slogans or forming human chains on campus. Defenders of the law have argued that the city’s academic freedom would remain untouched. But, they say, students and teachers should know that freedom of speech comes with limitations. “You can’t just allow teachers to talk, and impose their views, free for all,” said Regina Ip, a cabinet member who leads a pro-Beijing party in the legislature. “Critical thinking does not mean training people to criticize or attack.” Even before the law was enacted, the transformation of Hong Kong’s education system was already underway. The new school year had just started in September when Law Pei-lee, a teacher at a girls’ school, learned that a parent had filed a complaint about her conduct. She was accused of discussing the case of Lam Wing-kee, a local bookstore owner who was kidnapped by Chinese security officials in 2015. Ms. Law, a veteran teacher, said she had mentioned the incident in passing. But she said the education bureau repeatedly demanded an explanation. Though she was never officially punished, she said the monthslong investigation felt like “psychological torture.” Worse, Ms. Law said, she feared the law would stifle young minds. “Will our kids be able to think critically when they grow up?” Both the education bureau and an employee at Ms. Law’s school, Sacred Heart Canossian School Private Section, said they could not comment on individual cases. Some teachers and students say the investigations have created a climate of fear on campuses. A recent survey of more than 1,100 teachers found that around a third had been told by a supervisor to avoid discussing politics.  Some parents say they are only trying to keep their children out of harm’s way. “What are the teachers afraid of?” said Ho Chiu Fai, a father of a fifth-grader and founder of Help Our Next Generation, a group of volunteers who investigate complaints against teachers. “We are all very worried that our kids will do something illegal, like go to illegal protests.” Mr. Yeung, the education secretary, has vowed to “ferret out” problematic teachers. Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong’s former top leader, has set up a fund to help investigate teachers. “The Government have a duty to protect young minds from radicalization,” Mr. Leung wrote in an email. Some teachers have lost their jobs for not taking a harder line against protest-related actions in school. Lee Kwan-pui, a music teacher at Heung To Middle School, was fired in May after she let her students play “Glory to Hong Kong,” according to local media reports. Ms. Lee defended herself in an email she sent to the school’s staff and students, seen by The New York Times, saying she had reminded students to avoid social topics when choosing songs, but that ultimately it was their decision. “I never brought up my political stance to students on campus,” she wrote. After Ms. Lee’s firing, students formed human chains at the school in protest. Reached by telephone, an administrative employee at the school declined to comment. The new national security law — which authorizes life imprisonment for secession, terrorism and other political offenses in the most serious cases — could make navigating classroom discussions even more difficult for teachers. Liberal Studies, a mandatory civics course that has been blamed by some officials for radicalizing students, will likely come under much greater scrutiny. Chinese history has become a mandatory subject in middle schools, and some teachers have asked how they should discuss contentious events under the party’s rule. Schools must review their library catalogs to remove books that “provoke any acts or activities which endanger national security,” the bureau said in a statement to The Times. The law is already having a deterrent effect. At Ying Wa College, an elite boys’ school, a group of students who only last month chanted pro-independence slogans on the school’s sports field has now quickly disbanded and taken down its social media account. Beijing’s broader push for control over the city’s schools and its sweeping interpretation of national security also raises questions about the future of Hong Kong’s status as a hub for higher education in the region. The uncertainty over the law is driving concerns that scholars may be forced to censor themselves. Others fear that the vaguely defined crime of collusion could be applied to international academic collaborations. Bruce Lui, a senior lecturer in journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University, pointed out the many topics that are covered by mainland China’s own national security law, ranging from the economy to outer space and, lately, biosecurity. Could researchers in Hong Kong, he asked, be punished for publishing data on the origins of the new coronavirus if their findings implicated China? Some administrators are striking a defiant note. Kellee Tsai, the dean of the school of humanities and social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, encouraged her department to carry on their teaching and research as usual until further instructions were issued. “There may well be non-obvious ‘red lines’ in Hong Kong’s higher education sector that cannot be crossed without severe legal consequences,” she told them in an email seen by The Times. “Let’s not draw those lines ourselves.” Bella Huang contributed reporting.']",China’s leaders have pushed the territory to revamp an education system they see as having bred young rebels who have helped drive pro-democracy protests.
"Cairo Badly Needed a Detox. Lockdown Supplied One, at a Steep Price.",2020-07-09,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — If ever a city needed a good detox, it was Cairo. Centuries of turbulent history, topped with recent decades of chaotic urban development, have left the ancient metropolis in poor physical shape. Its complexion is parched and blemished. Traffic clogs its throbbing arteries. It has signs of major stress. The coronavirus obliged. Three months of lockdown, including an 11-hour nightly curfew, imposed a rejuvenating deep cleanse on Cairo. Roads once choked with honking cars ran free. The air, free of fumes, seemed to sparkle. Silence flooded the streets. At my apartment near the Nile, a bedroom that was barely usable because of the morning din became an oasis of calm. In the evenings, my family gathered on the balcony to witness sunsets that were more saturated than ever. The pollution app on my phone glowed an unfamiliar green. Of course, it came at a jarring price. On dawn runs down deserted streets, I passed anxious-looking people wearing masks, crowded around the entrance to a hospital. And then it was over. Toward the end of June, the government announced it was allowing mosques, restaurants and coffee houses to reopen. On the last night of curfew, I scrambled into the streets to capture its delicate pleasures one final time. Hundreds of Egyptians, it turned out, had the same idea. They clustered at dusk on a bridge, watching the squadron of kites that fluttered in the hot breeze shooting down the Nile. Young men in skinny jeans tugged on strings. Veiled women chased after dating couples, trying to sell them roses. Inevitably, the fun tweaked Egypt’s rulers, always wary of unsanctioned public gatherings. A senior lawmaker warned that the crowded skies posed a threat to national security because Egypt’s enemies could fit the kites with surveillance cameras. But on the bridge, nobody cared for such talk, preferring to wallow in this odd moment, between serenity and anxiety, when their city’s famously frenetic pulse had been slowed by a virus. I chatted with two brothers who held aloft a giant kite emblazoned with photographs of themselves, preening, and the soccer star Mohamed Salah, who was beaming. Nearby, Samiha Meneim, 62, perched on a rickety plastic chair, surrounded by 15 family members as well as half-eaten platters of koshary, Egypt’s national dish of spiced lentils, rice and macaroni. The picnic was a mercy dash after months cooped up in their cramped, low-rent neighborhood. “We had to get out,” said Ms. Meneim, a retired nurse in a black cloak who continued her treatment for breast cancer throughout the lockdown. She saw the coronavirus as a message from God. “He wants us to look at life differently,” she said. For much of Egypt’s history, its fate has been shaped by the Nile. The bridge of kites led to Roda Island, described in “One Thousand and One Nights” as a place of heavenly gardens, now a tight sprawl of dust-smeared apartment blocks. At its southern tip, though, there survives a Nilometer built in the ninth century —\xa0a structure that measured the river’s seasonal flooding and thus predicted the annual harvest. Now, disease was dictating the pace of life. As night fell and the curfew officially began, I crossed into downtown Cairo, a jumble of old palaces, crumbling elegance and gaudy shop fronts where, in normal times, the traffic is so crazy that guidebooks offer tourists solemn advice on how to survive. “Look for locals and join a group,” advises my edition of National Geographic Traveler. “They cross all together, one lane at a time.” That night it would have taken a miracle to get knocked down. The strays were in charge —\xa0skinny cats that strutted down empty boulevards, for once unbothered, and a pair of lordly street dogs that snoozed atop an SUV. The Metro Cinema, with its dust-encrusted Art Deco facade, opened in 1940 with “Gone With the Wind.” Now it had the eerie air of an abandoned film set, advertising the Egyptian movies it had been showing in March: “Peep Show,” and “The Thief of Baghdad.” In the late 19th century, Egypt’s ruler, Khedive Ismail, modeled this area on the airy elegance of Haussmann’s Paris, but for decades the graceful buildings have gradually crumbled into disrepair. Now, in the desolation of curfew, they seemed to stand proud again, as did the statues lining the way. The giant bronze lions that guard Qasr el Nil, the city’s most scenic bridge, looked more relaxed than ever with no foe in sight. The mix of eerie desolation and faded splendor had a touch of magic, and for an instant I thought of the Egyptian version of the movie “Night at the Museum,” in which the bronze lions come to life under darkness. But I was not entirely alone. Teenagers clustered conspiratorially in doorways. Food-delivery riders clustered around their motorcycles outside a restaurant. Business was brisk. “If it keeps going like this,” remarked Mahmoud Abdel Fattah, leaning over his handlebars, “I’ll be as rich as Naguib Sawiris” —\xa0an outspoken billionaire who has been a vociferous critic of the lockdown measures. Still, Mr. Fattah noted wryly that, at 28 cents per delivery, that fortune could take a while. “Maybe after one million pizzas,” he quipped. For all their ebullience, the deliverymen also had a downbeat air. Sure, they could zoom to any address in minutes. But Cairo without the grit, the grind, the bustle of people — was it really Cairo at all? Plagues are nothing new in Cairo. On a visit to Cairo in the 14th century, when the city’s 500,000 inhabitants made it the world’s largest city outside China, the explorer Ibn Battuta noted that an outbreak of the bubonic plague was killing as many as 20,000 people a day. Cholera hit repeatedly in the 19th century.  This time, the human cost is amplified by Egypt’s soaring population, which in February crossed the 100 million threshold, an unnerving milestone in a densely packed country. Outside the city center, the lockdown has been loosely observed —\xa0social distancing is little more than an admirable idea in the city’s cramped slums. Many Egyptians wear masks over their chins or spurn them entirely, much to the chagrin of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a fitness enthusiast who has urged Egyptians to stay safe, keep fit and lose weight during the lockdown. “Remember to do sport, it increases immunity levels,” he said in May. Otherwise, it has been business as usual for Mr. el-Sisi during the lockdown — with the arrest of rights activists, belly dancers and even young women who post dance videos to social media. The virus, though, cannot be banished so easily. Egypt has over 77,000 known cases, and confirmed infections have grown by about 1,400 cases a day for the past month. Egypt has registered more than 3,400 deaths, the highest toll in the Arab world. In an ominous portent, Mr. el-Sisi last week opened a 4,000-bed field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. And the economic toll is only now becoming apparent. Millions of workers have lost income, and families are cutting back on meat and other items that are now unaffordable. The International Monetary Fund has lent $8 billion to get Egypt through the crisis. More may be needed.  The day after the lockdown was lifted, I walked the same route again. The sense of magic had evaporated. Police officers patrolled the bridge where the kites had flown. The familiar rumble of traffic snarled the downtown, where some restaurants had opened. But others remained shut —\xa0it’s not worth it yet, the manager of Abou Tarek, the city’s most celebrated koshary emporium, told me \xa0— and there was talk that some restrictions could become permanent. Rules obliging restaurants and coffee houses to shut at 10 p.m. will remain after the virus, a cabinet spokesman said — an announcement that was consistent with Mr. el-Sisi’s desire to “civilize” Egyptians, but that met with muted indignation in a city famous for its vibrant all-night socializing. Egyptian rulers have announced similar detox measures in the past, only to quickly backtrack in the face of popular resistance. For now, what’s certain is that Cairenes are staying home, caught between their desire to get back to normal and their fear of what may be coming next — much like everywhere else.

Sweden’s Ex-Ambassador to China Is Cleared of Wrongdoing,2020-07-10,By Christina Anderson and Marc Santora,"['STOCKHOLM — A former Swedish ambassador to China was cleared of charges of wrongdoing on Friday, culminating a strange saga that combined elements of a spy novel with the opaque reality of dealing with an authoritarian state where people can be grabbed in public and disappear. It was the first time in modern history that a Swedish diplomat has been prosecuted for crimes against state security, and the often heated trial revolved around questions about the written and unwritten rules of diplomacy. The Swedish diplomat, Anna Lindstedt, was accused of overstepping the boundaries of her role by arranging what prosecutors said were secret back-room meetings over the fate of a Hong Kong bookseller and Swedish citizen who remains detained in China. The bookseller, Gui Minhai, has not been seen by his family or in public since February. Swedish prosecutors argued that Ms. Lindstedt had overstepped her authority in arranging a meeting between Mr. Gui’s daughter, Angela, and two businessmen who offered to help her secure her father’s freedom. Hans Ihrman, the deputy chief public prosecutor for Sweden’s National Security Unit, argued that the meeting was instead an attempt to intimidate Ms. Gui and silence her scathing critiques of Beijing. Ms. Lindstedt’s defense team argued that she had acted solely out of a desire to free a Swedish citizen. Two retired ambassadors gave testimony on her behalf, saying that ambassadors have wide latitude to act and are not obligated to report everything to the Foreign Ministry. She was also supported by twenty-one former Swedish diplomats, who earlier this year wrote a defense of Ms. Lindstedt in Dagens Nyheter, a daily newspaper, arguing that she was availing herself of standard tools and powers at an ambassador’s disposal. “The description of the crime refers to completely different, traitorous situations associated with war and conflicts,” the former ambassadors wrote. The court agreed, saying the prosecution had not met any of the requirements to prove their case and finding Ms. Lindstedt not guilty on the official charge of “arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power.” “The court did not see that the prosecutor has proved that the ambassador negotiated with anyone representing the Chinese state,” Judge Anna Flodin said during a news conference announcing the verdict. “The court found that had she done so, she would have been empowered to in her role as ambassador.” “I am pleased and relieved,” Ms. Lindstedt told Dagens Nyheter. “As a Swedish diplomat you have to turn every stone to free a citizen who is being held.” The case — and the underlying issues related to the detention of a Swedish citizen — exacerbated a deep rift between Sweden and China and underscored many of the fears about Beijing’s’s deepening influence in a Hong Kong, where people’s long guaranteed civil liberties, including freedom of speech and assembly, have been increasingly eroded by the Chinese government. Before China imposed a draconian new security law over Hong Kong that threatens the territory’s vibrant culture of political dissent, Beijing came for the city booksellers. Mr. Gui, who published books critical of China’s Communist leaders, was one of five book publishers taken into custody in 2015. The brazenness of his seizure — he was snatched by the police aboard a train to Beijing while being watched by Swedish diplomats — provoked an international outcry. Mr. Gui’s daughter, Angela Gui, said in a July 1 Twitter post that her father’s arrest should have served as a warning of China’s crackdown on Hong Kong, which it announced that day. Mr. Gui, 54, was born in eastern China and traveled to Sweden to study in 1988, eventually becoming a Swedish citizen in 1992. In recent years, he had worked in Hong Kong, where he was a co-owner of Mighty Current Media, a small publishing house that produced salacious and often poorly sourced books about Chinese Communist Party leaders. He was at his vacation home in Thailand in 2015 when he was first arrested and spirited off the China. In early 2016, Mr. Gui appeared on Chinese state television and gave what seemed to be a rehearsed confession to a drunken-driving death in China more than a decade earlier. He was formally freed from detention in October 2017, but he remained in eastern China under close watch, according to Ms. Gui. In January 2018, as two Swedish diplomats accompanied Mr. Gui to Beijing on a train, Chinese security officers boarded it and abducted him. The Swedish foreign minister called it a “brutal intervention” that violated international law. Soon afterward, Mr. Gui appeared on Chinese television, saying in an interview organized by the police that he didn’t need help from Sweden. Mr. Gui was last heard from publicly at a sentencing hearing in China in February. A court in the city of Ningbo in eastern China did not provide details about the accusations against him beyond issuing a brief notice saying he had “undermined China’s national security and interests.” Ms. Lindstedt was accused late last year of arranging the talks between Mr. Gui’s daughter and two Chinese men who had offered to help free her father in January. But according to a detailed account that Ms. Gui published on Medium, the meeting was strange. “What I thought was going to be a meeting about the Swedish government’s latest efforts to win my father’s release turned out to something quite different,” she wrote. “The businessmen spoke to me with a mix of flattery and reassurances that they were going to ‘help me,’ without explaining how this help was going to be delivered.” She testified in the trial, saying she felt “very pressured” at the meeting. Mr. Ihrman, the deputy chief public prosecutor, described the meeting as an attempt by Chinese officials to stop Ms. Gui’s criticism of the Chinese government. “It’s about this daughter’s right to freedom of speech, which they have tried to act upon,” he said at the start of the trial. In court, Mr. Olin tried to demonstrate a pattern of how China and the Chinese ambassador in Sweden responded to Swedish criticism of Gui Minhai’s imprisonment and other cases in which China was presented in a negative light, citing reports by the Swedish Institute of International Affairs and the Swedish Defense Research Agency. However, a lawyer for Ms. Lindstedt, Conny Cedermark, argued that her client was innocent. “Arbitrary conduct in negotiation with a foreign power has a series of prerequisites,” he said, and none of them had been met in the case. The court agreed. Christina Anderson reported from Stockholm, and Marc Santora from London.']",Anna Lindstedt was found not guilty of overstepping the boundaries of her role when she arranged secret meetings over the fate of a Hong Kong bookseller and Swedish citizen who remains detained in China.
"‘Whac-a-Mole’ Against Virus Sounds Reasonable, Unless You’re the Mole",2020-07-09,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LEICESTER, England — Fresh buttercream wastes away in an empty cake shop. Young men slip past the lockdown border to reopened pubs in nearby towns. And neighbors blame neighbors for a new outbreak of the coronavirus that has stalled their return to something resembling normal life. In Leicester, a city of ramshackle garment factories and multigenerational homes in the heart of England, the imposition of a second lockdown late last month has induced a sort of whiplash among people who were still recovering from the first. The city of 340,000 in the East Midlands was shuttered as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to play “Whac-a-Mole” with the virus, bringing a mallet down on any areas suffering an outbreak. But carving a stay-at-home border around one region while others hurry back to pubs and jobs has proved to be a convoluted and divisive step. And it illuminates the difficulties that countries across Europe and Asia will face as they try to battle local flare-ups of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Weeks of delays by the government in giving local officials in England details about test results made it difficult to detect clusters of new infections before they spread. With sweatshops employing mostly underpaid South Asian immigrant workers operating during lockdown, Leicester was a prime candidate for a second outbreak. Its garment workers were packed together not only in the factories but also at home — confined spaces where the virus can easily spread. Once known for “clothing the world,” Leicester has struggled as larger manufacturers moved overseas. It recently ranked as the 21st most deprived of more than 300 local authorities in England. And now, residents complain, it has to shoulder the reputation of becoming England’s first city to be convulsed a second time by the coronavirus. “The only time people have known how to say ‘Leicester’ is when we won the Premier League and we found a dead king,” said Dharmesh Lakhani, the owner of Bobby’s, an Indian restaurant, on the city’s normally bustling Belgrave Road. The city soccer team won the 2016 championship and archaeologists in 2012 found Richard III’s remains under a parking lot where a 16th-century priory once stood. “Now these are the three highlights,” he said. “Being locked down again attaches a stigma to us.” In Leicester (pronounced “Lester,” in case anyone was wondering), recriminations are flying over why local officials were not given centrally held data showing a spike in infections sooner. “We are a very centralized country — probably one of, if not the most, centralized in the democratic world,” Sir Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, said in an interview. “And if it’s all done from the center, they’re missing out on local expertise, and we’re sitting here very frustrated at not being trusted.” Pouncing on an outbreak depends upon testing and tracking cases down to the level of single office buildings and neighborhoods, a strategy that England has struggled to develop. Chief among its problems has been a network of privately run testing sites that for weeks processed tens of thousands of daily tests, without the government sharing detailed results with local officials. Only testing results from public hospitals were being quickly shared. Those blind spots made Mr. Johnson’s decision to reopen England seem hasty to some experts. Leicester’s lockdown was triggered by an infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 people, nearly three times as high as the bar set by Germany. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that the lifting of the national lockdown appeared timed to the easing of the virus in London, and not its more stubborn spread elsewhere. In an internal report on the outbreak, Leicester officials said the government had denied them testing data in recent months on the grounds that “it hadn’t been cleaned.”  Government officials have said the data processing had not yet been automated, causing delays. When Leicester was given citywide test results on June 1 showing an elevated number of new cases, city officials were alarmed. But on a call in the following days with Leicester’s public health director, national health officials denied anything was amiss, the report said. The city’s public health director “was told it was probably ‘a small numbers issue’ and may well go down again in the following week’s data release,” the report said. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said, “At no point did the department or Public Health England seek to downplay the situation in Leicester. In fact, our close monitoring of the outbreak allowed us to take early action, including through extra testing capacity and providing additional data analysis.” Extra testing was not introduced until June 20, Leicester officials said, shortly after the government publicly confirmed an outbreak. With government health officials struggling to pinpoint the hotspot, and deliberating whether to delay future reopenings or ask everyone to stay at home, it took until June 29 for a lockdown to be announced. Even now, Leicester officials said, they were being notified of positive results only in local areas, and not the overall number of tests, preventing them from determining the rate of new infections. The data also have missing or incorrect information about people’s workplaces — as with a reputed eight-year-old health care worker — making it difficult to trace the spread. Government officials have said that Leicester was slow to complete data security forms required to access testing information. The mayor also publicly questioned the lockdown shortly before it was announced, saying that he was “deeply skeptical” of what it would achieve. On a recent gloomy day, with rain threatening from a leaden sky and shops sitting empty behind closure notices, the city looked ghostly. Pubs and restaurants once poised to open along with those elsewhere in England were shuttered, and boxes of supplies sat stacked on tables. At Sugar and Ice, a cake shop that had reopened in mid-June only to partly close again because of the lockdown, Debbie Bass, the owner, tallied her looming losses. Forty kilograms of buttercream was nearing its expiration date. So was £200, or $250, of sponge cake bases. Three cake orders had already been postponed or canceled. And an employee whom Ms. Bass had rehired off furlough had been sent home. “Now she’s back on furlough and we go through it all over again,” Ms. Bass said. “It’s rather a waste of money and a waste of time.” Adding to the stress for residents was confusion over the lockdown borders. Even the mayor said on the day the lockdown started that he did not know where it applied. “Sitting up all night refreshing social media to see if we had any updates wasn’t very good,” Ms. Bass said. With caution tape still fluttering from the bars of playground equipment, some of the heaviest activity in Leicester was centered last week in the garment factories that analysts fear could have seeded the outbreak. The so-called dark factories — housed in the shells of old buildings, their windows often papered over inside — pay workers as little as £3.50, or $4.40, an hour, a fraction of the national living wage. Their biggest buyers are cheap online retailers like Boohoo, which thrived in the pandemic by switching to leisure wear. The factories — exempt, like other manufacturers, from lockdown — forced workers to show up sick, workers told an advocacy group, Labour Behind the Label. At one 80-person factory, a fifth of the staff had the virus. Labor unions have criticized the government’s Health and Safety Executive, which had been promised an extra £14 million to enforce workplace safety during the pandemic, for not inspecting factories and other facilities more aggressively. “It’s almost like an open secret,” said Dominique Muller of Labour Behind the Label, referring to the longstanding labor abuses. “But there hasn’t been any coherent response from the government.” The high rate of infection in nearby South Asian neighborhoods fed a false perception that nonwhite residents were to blame for the outbreak, spawning racist remarks online. For a city with a long history of immigrant arrivals, the racism has stung. “People are labeling the whole Asian community,” said Priti Raichura, who runs a wedding business in the city. “I have seen lots of racist comments.” Like many places walloped by the coronavirus, Leicester is a deeply unequal city: The gap in life expectancy between the healthiest and sickest neighborhoods is more than six years. The prevalence of diabetes is among the highest in England and rising. But rather than supply public health teams and local doctors with infection data they could have used to warn patients, the government left them in the dark, said Professor Kamlesh Khunti of the University of Leicester, who is also a general practitioner. “We know the family structures better than most,” he said. “Like others, we suffered all these months, but now we have to wait before we can get back to something the rest of the country already has, which seems unfair.”']","When the city of Leicester was shocked with a second lockdown, it lashed back with anger and recriminations."
Japan’s Deadly Combination: Climate Change and an Aging Society,2020-07-09,"By Motoko Rich, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno","['TOKYO — The forecast was dire: close to nine inches of rain in a single day. Officials in Kuma, a village on the banks of a fast-moving river in southwestern Japan, urged everyone to evacuate. Yet inside the Senjuen nursing home, the 70 residents were left in place. The decision proved disastrous. The rain that fell early Saturday was even worse than expected, a blinding downpour that soon inundated the village’s streets. Caretakers in the nursing home, which lacked an elevator, struggled to move residents to the second floor. For 14 of them, it was too late — the river breached its banks, killing them in its floodwaters. The events at the nursing home were the deadliest in a week of floods and landslides that have killed 62 people in Kyushu, Japan’s southwesternmost main island. They represent a collision of two powerful forces shaping the country’s present and future: demographic change and global warming. In recent years, climate change has spurred more torrential rains in Japan, causing deadly flooding and mudslides in a nation with many rivers and mountains. The people most vulnerable to the risks of this extreme weather are the elderly, of which Japan has the highest proportion in the world. Nursing homes, especially those with small, overtaxed staffs, face particular challenges because of how difficult it can be to evacuate aging, frail people in the midst of disaster. The rains this week, which have killed mostly people over age 65, flooded more than 50 nursing homes in Kyushu, where Japan’s Meteorological Agency ordered more than a million people within Kumamoto and Kagoshima Prefectures to evacuate. Two years ago, when flooding and landslides killed 237 people across 14 prefectures in western Japan, about three-fifths were over 65. “Now that Japan is getting older and older and the intensity of rainfall is increasing year by year,” said Kenichi Tsukahara, a professor in the disaster risk reduction research center at Kyushu University, “we have double difficulties.” This year, the coronavirus pandemic is adding an extra layer of complexity. As people evacuate to gyms and other community centers, social distancing can be difficult. The elderly are again more vulnerable: The virus kills older people at a far higher rate. Of the 981 people who have died from the coronavirus in Japan, more than 80 percent were 70 or older. Fears of the virus may discourage older residents from leaving their homes, even when it is dangerous to stay. And if they do go to evacuation centers, they could be at risk for heatstroke — especially at sites with poor air conditioning — because of the need to wear masks. It could create “a very tough situation for people to be able to breathe comfortably during heat waves,” said Hisashi Nakamura, a professor at the climate science laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Although the Japanese gird every June and July for the rainy season — known as tsuyu — this year the rainfall has set records in Kyushu, with more rain expected to blanket central Japan by the end of this week. Older residents accustomed to year after year of summer rains may believe they know how to ride out the downpours at home. Yet they may not understand the growing severity of the rains or the increased dangers of flooding. “Under the emerging impact of global warming, there is an increasing risk or potential that rainfall amounts could be at a level that we haven’t experienced in the past,” Professor Nakamura said. “So I think that citizens must realize that their previous experience may no longer work. We have to act even earlier or faster than what we have experienced in the past.” Evacuation itself can pose a risk to the elderly. Conditions in evacuation centers inevitably fall short of those in nursing homes designed for old-age care. For the frailest patients, the moves can cause injury or destabilize long-term care plans. Facility operators have mixed feelings about evacuations, said Hajime Kagiya, a professor of disaster management at Atomi University in Tokyo. “They have to be mindful of the health conditions of the residents as well as choosing a place to evacuate to,” he said. “So they tend to take their time in making the decision to evacuate.” The Japanese government issues standardized evacuation protocols, but they do not take into account the unique characteristics or terrain in different parts of the country, said Professor Tsukahara of Kyushu University. In rural areas, many small villages are isolated and populated by mostly aging residents, with few local resources to help with disaster planning or, in the event of a crisis, to assist with evacuation or rescue. In the case of the Senjuen nursing home, Aki Goto, its director, told The Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, a local newspaper, that she had been more concerned about mudslides than flooding. When the waters came, she added, the caregivers could not move quickly enough to move all the residents upstairs. Six of the workers were on call the night of the floods last weekend, the newspaper reported. That still left each caregiver in charge of more than 10 aging residents, some of whom were unable to walk without help. Even with the aid of local volunteers, they could not bring everyone to safety upstairs as the floodwaters rapidly rose and deluged the ground floor. According to Shigemitsu Sakoda, 53, the president of Land Earth, a local rafting and outdoor sports company who assisted with the rescue effort at Senjuen, only the caretakers and two local volunteer firefighters were moving residents when Mr. Sakoda arrived to help around noon on Saturday. “It’s a really tough job for such a small number of people to carry up those who cannot walk to the second floor,” Mr. Sakoda said in a telephone interview. By the time troops from the Japan Self-Defense Forces arrived to rescue the nursing home residents from the roof, some had already died below. Three years ago, the Japanese government revised a law that requires nursing homes, hospitals, facilities for the disabled and schools located in flood zones to develop evacuation plans and conduct regular drills. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, just over a third of the country’s 68,000 facilities had evacuation plans on record by March of last year. The importance of these efforts was illustrated last fall when Typhoon Hagibis, a record-breaking storm, slammed into the greater Tokyo area. As a power outage rendered elevators inoperable at a nursing home in Kawagoe, in the exurban prefecture of Saitama, 24 caregivers who had rigorously planned and drilled were able to move all 120 residents to the second floor in the middle of the night. The following day, all of the residents — most in their 80s and 90s and many suffering from dementia — were rescued by local firefighters, prefectural police officers and national Self-Defense Forces troops. Some disaster experts say that too often, local municipalities are left to handle evacuations without much help from the national government until a dramatic rescue operation is required. “These floods are not one-off ‘black swan’ events that could not be anticipated,” said Kyle Cleveland, a professor of sociology at the Tokyo campus of Temple University who has studied the Japanese government response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. “Despite having highly trained staff, world-class equipment and well-established emergency response plans,” he added, “when things go sideways, this lack of coordination between state, prefectural and local authorities inordinately delays the response, leaving vulnerable citizens unnecessarily exposed to harm.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe initially dispatched about 10,000 Self-Defense Forces troops to Kyushu over the weekend. Earlier this week, he doubled the number to 20,000, along with 60,000 police officers, firefighters and Coast Guard rescue workers. With the ferocity of floods and landslides intensifying in Japan, some experts suggested that nursing homes and other facilities that cater to the elderly may simply have to move. The Senjuen home in Kuma, for example, “is located in a hazardous area,” said Dr. Kagiya of Atomi University. Given the speed and quantity of rainfall, he said, “it would be very difficult to evacuate no matter how much they struggled.” “When we have victims from disasters, multiple unlucky factors are involved,” he said. “This time that was the case, too. The best solution is to relocate to a safer area.” Hikari Hida contributed reporting.']","Record-breaking rains this week in the country’s southernmost main island, which have killed 62, have shown the vulnerability of people living in nursing homes."
Dispatch from a Locked-Down Melbourne,2020-07-10,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. Melbourne winters are notoriously depressing. The days are short and often gray, the rain is cold and persistent. For those of us who live here, coping mechanisms are important. We sit in front of blazing fireplaces at neighborhood pubs, we take trips to the countryside or plan our annual holidays abroad during these long dark months. We gather for family dinners and make sure our exercise routines are uninterrupted. As of this week, with almost all of those coping strategies taken away thanks to a new six week lockdown order, the mood among family and friends and strangers on the internet is defeated and dark. We are now allowed to leave our homes only for work, to exercise, to shop for essential items or to give or receive care. People are quick to say that they’re grateful for a government and society willing to take quick and decisive action to keep us safe, and the ever-more-horrifying situation in the U.S. is a constant reminder of how lucky we are to be in Australia. But we are struggling. In my small circle of family and friends, we’re struggling to get out of bed, struggling to pay our bills, struggling with parenting, struggling with a sense of self when our careers are on hold. There are many things I was planning in order to make it through this winter. We have begun a tradition of an extended family celebration and midwinter feast — I call it “fake Christmas” — which was scheduled for August 8th. Much of my own mental health is bolstered by swimming laps, which acts as exercise but also meditation. I had a few sweet weeks of swimming in June before the pools shut down again. Fake Christmas is on hold indefinitely. My son is spending a huge chunk of his 16th year as if he were grounded. Friends who are lucky to still have work are grappling with how to care for young children who will be learning from home again. Loved ones who live alone are anticipating the next lonely six weeks with a dread that wasn’t nearly as oppressive during the first lockdown. Next week marks a major anniversary for me and my husband, and we had plans to go somewhere sunny for a couple of days. Those ambitions shrank when it became clear that travel was impossible so we booked into a nice hotel here in Melbourne. Now we’ll spend it at home, and try to differentiate between this special day and all the others with champagne and oysters ordered directly from suppliers who have excess product that usually would be sold to restaurants. We are lucky! Champagne and oysters in a warm house with a man I love is not exactly a punishment. But everywhere I look I see disappointment and anxiety, and guilt because we should feel lucky. We are safe. There are bright spots — the two family members who are here on visas that make them ineligible for government assistance are also spending their free time volunteering to make and deliver food to those who have no other means of sustenance. The outpouring of support and anxiety for the residents of the public housing towers on hard lockdown reminds me of the intensely communal nature of Australian culture. I would not want to be anywhere else. I am so grateful that the physical health of my city is being protected. But I have a deep pit of worry for our collective mental health. We will make it through. And when we do, it will almost be spring. How are you keeping positive during lockdown? Let us know at nytaustralia@nytimes.com.

NASA Scientist Jailed in Turkey for 3 Years Recounts His Ordeal,2020-07-09,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — When Turkish police officers stopped him as he set out for the airport to return to the United States after a family vacation in Turkey, the country of his birth, Serkan Golge, a NASA scientist and American citizen, was in disbelief. It was July 2016, eight anxious days after a failed coup tried to unseat President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the police told Mr. Golge that they had received an anonymous tip that he worked for the C.I.A. and was part of a terrorist group accused of masterminding the plot. The idea was so far-fetched that Mr. Golge expected to sort it out quickly and changed his flight to the next day. “I was quite shocked, but I was like, ‘This will go away,’” he said. “This is probably a mistake and the police and prosecutors would figure this out.” It would take four years. Mr. Golge and his family returned to Houston just last week, ending a nightmare in which he was held for three years in solitary confinement as he became a bargaining chip in a series of high-level disputes between the Turkish and American governments. In his first interview since arriving home, Mr. Golge described with exasperation but little rancor the ordeal of being charged and found guilty of terrorist activities on evidence so flimsy he called it “garbage.” His account provides a rare insight into the Turkish judicial machine from the side of a defendant. Some 70,000 people have been accused in the Turkish courts in connection with the failed coup. Many, still fearful of the whims of Turkish justice, prefer to keep silent even once they are freed. Mr. Erdogan’s government has blamed the coup attempt on Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. Soon after the coup, pro-government Turkish media outlets began accusing the American government of being behind the plot, suggesting that it was in league with Mr. Gulen. For Mr. Golge, who has a doctorate in physics and worked as a senior research scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, being an American citizen was enough to be presumed guilty. “You fit the profile,” he recalled his lawyer telling him at one point. “It does not really matter if you are innocent or not. They won’t release you.” After 14 days, Mr. Golge appeared before a judge who told him the police had found an American dollar bill in his parent’s house, which the Turkish authorities alleged was a badge of membership to the Gulen movement, by then designated a terrorist group. He was held in a general prison in southern Turkey, alongside high-ranking military officers, judges and prosecutors, some of whom told him that they were being held without any evidence at all. Senior military officers and civilian supporters of Mr. Gulen have been charged over their part in leading the coup and ordering the bombing of the Parliament and clashes that killed 250 people. But thousands of others who were accused had only tenuous links to Mr. Gulen’s movement, or, like the military cadets who were ordered out on the night of the coup, had little idea what was going on. Journalists and political opponents of Mr. Erdogan with no connection to the events were prosecuted as well. Mr. Golge was sent to a prison in the town of Iskenderun, where in the August heat 32 men were crammed in a cell made for eight. He slept on a blanket on the floor and soon fell ill with bronchitis. Within a month, he was moved to solitary confinement and faced charges of overthrowing the government and the constitution, which carried a life sentence, and a charge of belonging to a terrorist organization, which carried a 15-year sentence. “‘That’s it, I’m never getting out of here,’” he recalled thinking. “That was a collapse psychologically, and I cried a lot.” “It is a very small room — it barely sees the sunlight, and the guards took me out only one hour a day,” he said. “And I stayed in that room, in that small single cell, for three years.” For a long time, Mr. Golge clung to the fact that the evidence the Turkish prosecutors presented was hardly incriminating. The anonymous tip turned out to be from a relative who bore a grudge against Mr. Golge’s sister and later admitted he did not know if his allegations were true. The prosecutors drew on other evidence, and even Mr. Golge acknowledges that he fits the profile of a possible member of the Gulen movement. He went to Fatih University, which was one of the most prominent Gulen schools, on a scholarship to study physics; he banked with Bank Asya, which was part of the Gulen network of companies. But none of that, he points out, amounts to a crime. “A one dollar bill, an anonymous tip, a bank account? How is this terrorism?” Mr. Golge asked. “Nobody could explain, but I think this is how laws and courts still work in Turkey.” Mr. Golge has condemned the coup attempt and says he had nothing to do with the Gulen movement. “I am not part of this organization,” he said. “I am very sorry for the people who lost their lives. This is something unacceptable. Violence is never a solution. I have always believed in democracy, and I think currently it is the best solution we have.” But he says Turkey missed an opportunity by not dealing justly with the coup attempt. Instead, zealous prosecutors have pursued people far beyond the actual perpetrators, sweeping up many who have been judged guilty by association. Mr. Golge recalls a fellow inmate, a former judge, telling him the government had no evidence against him. “At least there was some bogus evidence about you,” he told Mr. Golge, “but I don’t know why I was arrested.” He shared time in the exercise yard with a one-star general who told him he had opposed the coup but had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment anyway because his name appeared on a list of appointments made by the coup plotters. “If Turkey only prosecuted the responsible people, instead of prosecuting hundreds of thousands of innocent people, I think that Turkish democracy would come out of this horrible act much stronger,” Mr. Golge said. Gradually, with American officials including President Trump pressing Turkey for his release over the lack of evidence, the charges against Mr. Golge were reduced. He was eventually convicted of aiding a terrorist organization, and the sentence was reduced on appeal. He said he sensed the Turkish judges knew the case against him was “garbage” but were compelled to drag out the process. “I felt they were scared of something,” he added. He was released from prison in May 2019 and in April this year was cleared to leave the country. But then he was hospitalized with stomach ulcers, and the coronavirus pandemic grounded flights. The strain of the past four years on his wife, Kubra, and two boys, ages 4 and 10, erupted at the airport, when Mr. Golge was pulled aside at passport control and held for 40 minutes. “My wife started crying, the kids started crying,” he said. “I tried to stay calm because I knew they had no basis to hold me, but they were shaking so hard. My son was crying a lot, grabbing me, holding on to me, saying ‘No Dad, not again, not again.’” Officials at the U.S. Embassy, who were tracking his progress, ensured he made the flight. Back in Houston, he is rebuilding his life, applying for his old job and looking for a house. “Your life — four years, three years in prison — will not come back,” he said. “But that’s life. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win.’’']","Finally home in Houston, Serkan Golge is still dismayed by the “garbage” evidence linking him to a failed coup and says the country is missing a chance to build its democracy."
Australia Halts Hong Kong Extradition Agreement and Extends Visas,2020-07-09,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — Australia will suspend its extradition agreement with Hong Kong because of the new national security law imposed by China and extend temporary visas for Hong Kongers in the country, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday. The announcement, which came on the heels of Canada’s suspension of its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and Britain’s statement that it was considering a similar move, threatened to deepen the diplomatic tensions between Canberra and Beijing. Mr. Morrison said Australia’s visa extension for people from Hong Kong who are already in the country would allow them to stay for an additional five years and open a path to permanent residency. He also suggested businesses should move from Hong Kong to his country, declaring, “We are a great immigration nation.” Australia also updated its advice to citizens about traveling to Hong Kong, citing questions about the interpretation of the security law and the risk of Australians being sent to mainland China for prosecution. “You may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds,” Australia’s travel advice states. “You could break the law without intending to.” The announcements were the latest in a series of moves by countries in response to a law that has drastically increased the role of Beijing’s security services in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous former British colony that returned to China in 1997. It raised fears that Beijing would curb free speech, the ability to assemble and other rights that have traditionally been better protected in Hong Kong than in mainland China. Mr. Morrison said Australia’s decisions were in response to the potentially sweeping effects of the new security law imposed on Hong Kong. “Our government, together with other governments around the world, have been very consistent in expressing our concerns about the imposition of the national security law on Hong Kong,” Mr. Morrison said. “Today we have agreed to announce that that national security law constitutes a fundamental change of circumstances in respect to our extradition agreement with Hong Kong.” He said that the government was not expecting large numbers of new applications from Hong Kong, and the application and approval processes would remain unchanged. Australia’s move is not as sweeping as Britain’s decision to open a path to citizenship for as many as three million Hong Kongers. But the announcement reflected global concern about China’s new law for the territory. New Zealand’s government also said on Thursday that it would review the country’s relationship with Hong Kong. “China’s decision to pass a new national security law for Hong Kong has fundamentally changed the environment for international engagement there,” said Winston Peters, the country’s deputy prime minister who also handles foreign affairs. Taiwan, where several participants in Hong Kong’s protest movement have fled over the past year, has also established an office to help Hong Kongers. The Chinese Embassy in Canberra denounced Australia’s move over Hong Kong. “We urge the Australian side to immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs,” it said in a statement, adding, “Otherwise it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet.” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Australia’s announcements “seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.” China “reserves the right to respond further,” he added, without offering specifics. But Hong Kongers in Australia welcomed Mr. Morrison’s move. “Hong Kong is facing something hopeless and dreadful,” said Sunny Cheng, a representative for the Association of Hong Kongers in Western Australia. “We are really grateful that Australia offers a helping hand in this really difficult period of time.” Extending incentives for Hong Kong businesses to establish themselves in Australia would help rebuild Australia’s economy in turn, he added. “We are hardworking. We can help to rebuild,” Mr. Cheng said. Isabella Kwai contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia.

"Major Explosion Rocks Iran Again, the 3rd Blast in 3 Weeks",2020-07-10,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['An explosion rocked western Tehran early Friday, state media reported, causing widespread power failures in two residential areas and unnerving Iranians awakened for the third consecutive week by an early-morning blast. The precise location of Friday’s explosion was unclear, but analysts said there were several military and training facilities in the area that could be the target of sabotage. A cause was not immediately determined. “There are two underground facilities, a site associated with chemical weapons research and an unidentified military production site,” said Fabian Hinz, an Iran military expert and research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. Iranian officials gave contradictory statements about the event. The mayor of Garmdareh, a nearby town, said the sound heard by residents was an “explosion at a factory making gas cylinders.” But even though state media had already reported the blast, the member of Parliament from the affected area, Hossein Haghverdi, said there was no explosion and that the power outage had been caused by some temporary problem at a local power station. It was the third major explosion to have occurred in Iran between midnight and 3 a.m. over three consecutive weeks. The first two explosions occurred at key military and nuclear bases — in Khojir, home of the country’s largest missile production facility; and at the Natanz nuclear base, at a building that housed centrifuge assembly. Iran described the Khojir episode as a gas tank explosion. Independent analysts said it was unclear whether the cause was an accident, sabotage or something else, although they noted that Iran had initially given a misleading location. Iran has not publicly disclosed the results of its investigation into the Natanz explosion, citing national security concerns. But a Middle Eastern intelligence official with knowledge of the episode said Israel was responsible for the attack on the Natanz nuclear complex, using a powerful bomb. A member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who was briefed on the matter also said that an explosive was used. The string of explosions have Iranians on edge, coming amid the coronavirus pandemic, a free-falling currency and economic hardship. “Explosion after explosion? How many security holes do you have?” one Iranian asked on Twitter.']","The precise location of Friday’s explosion was unclear, but analysts said there are several military and training facilities in the area."
"Defying U.S., China and Iran Near Trade and Military Partnership",2020-07-11,By Farnaz Fassihi and Steven Lee Myers,"['Iran and China have quietly drafted a sweeping economic and security partnership that would clear the way for billions of dollars of Chinese investments in energy and other sectors, undercutting the Trump administration’s efforts to isolate the Iranian government because of its nuclear and military ambitions. The partnership, detailed in an 18-page proposed agreement obtained by The New York Times, would vastly expand Chinese presence in banking, telecommunications, ports, railways and dozens of other projects. In exchange, China would receive a regular — and, according to an Iranian official and an oil trader, heavily discounted — supply of Iranian oil over the next 25 years. The document also describes deepening military cooperation, potentially giving China a foothold in a region that has been a strategic preoccupation of the United States for decades. It calls for joint training and exercises, joint research and weapons development and intelligence sharing — all to fight “the lopsided battle with terrorism, drug and human trafficking and cross-border crimes.” The partnership — first proposed by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, during a visit to Iran in 2016 — was approved by President Hassan Rouhani’s cabinet in June, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said last week. Iranian officials have publicly stated that there is a pending agreement with China, and one Iranian official, as well as several people who have discussed it with the Iranian government, confirmed that it is the document obtained by The Times, which is labeled “final version” and dated June 2020. It has not yet been submitted to Iran’s Parliament for approval or made public, stoking suspicions in Iran about how much the government is preparing to give away to China. In Beijing, officials have not disclosed the terms of the agreement, and it is not clear whether Mr. Xi’s government has signed off or, if it has, when it might announce it. If put into effect as detailed, the partnership would create new and potentially dangerous flash points in the deteriorating relationship between China and the United States. It represents a major blow to the Trump administration’s aggressive policy toward Iran since abandoning the nuclear deal reached in 2015 by President Barack Obama and the leaders of six other nations after two years of grueling negotiations. Renewed American sanctions, including the threat to cut off access to the international banking system for any company that does business in Iran, have succeeded in suffocating the Iranian economy by scaring away badly needed foreign trade and investment. But Tehran’s desperation has pushed it into the arms of China, which has the technology and appetite for oil that Iran needs. Iran has been one of the world’s largest oil producers, but its exports, Tehran’s largest source of revenue, have plunged since the Trump administration began imposing sanctions in 2018; China gets about 75 percent of its oil from abroad and is the world’s largest importer, at more than 10 million barrels a day last year. At a time when the United States is reeling from recession and the coronavirus, and increasingly isolated internationally, Beijing senses American weakness. The draft agreement with Iran shows that unlike most countries, China feels it is in a position to defy the United States, powerful enough to withstand American penalties, as it has in the trade war waged by President Trump. “Two ancient Asian cultures, two partners in the sectors of trade, economy, politics, culture and security with a similar outlook and many mutual bilateral and multilateral interests will consider one another strategic partners,” the document says in its opening sentence. The Chinese investments in Iran, which two people who have been briefed on the deal said would total $400 billion over 25 years, could spur still more punitive actions against Chinese companies, which have already been targeted by the administration in recent months. “The United States will continue to impose costs on Chinese companies that aid Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism,” a State Department spokeswoman wrote in response to questions about the draft agreement. “By allowing or encouraging Chinese companies to conduct sanctionable activities with the Iranian regime, the Chinese government is undermining its own stated goal of promoting stability and peace.” The expansion of military assistance, training and intelligence-sharing will also be viewed with alarm in Washington. American warships already tangle regularly with Iranian forces in the crowded waters of the Persian Gulf and challenge China’s internationally disputed claim to much of the South China Sea, and the Pentagon’s national security strategy has declared China an adversary. When reports of a long-term investment agreement with Iran surfaced last September, China’s foreign ministry dismissed the question out of hand. Asked about it again last week, a spokesman, Zhao Lijian, left open the possibility that a deal was in the works. “China and Iran enjoy traditional friendship, and the two sides have been in communication on the development of bilateral relations,” he said. “We stand ready to work with Iran to steadily advance practical cooperation.” The projects — nearly 100 are cited in the draft agreement — are very much in keeping with Mr. Xi’s ambitions to extend its economic and strategic influence across Eurasia through the “Belt and Road Initiative,” a vast aid and investment program. The projects, including airports, high-speed railways and subways, would touch the lives of millions of Iranians. China would develop free-trade zones in Maku, in northwestern Iran; in Abadan, where the Shatt al-Arab river flows into the Persian Gulf, and on the gulf island Qeshm. The agreement also includes proposals for China to build the infrastructure for a 5G telecommunications network, to offer the new Chinese Global Positioning System, Beidou, and to help Iranian authorities assert greater control over what circulates in cyberspace, presumably as China’s Great Firewall does. The American campaign against a major Chinese telecommunications company, Huawei, includes a criminal case against its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, for seeking to disguise investments in Iran in order to evade American sanctions. The Trump administration has barred Huawei from involvement in 5G development in the United States, and has tried, without great success, to persuade other countries to do the same. Moving ahead with a broad investment program in Iran appears to signal Beijing’s growing impatience with the Trump administration after its abandonment of the nuclear agreement. China has repeatedly called on the administration to preserve the deal, which it was a party to, and has sharply denounced the American use of unilateral sanctions. Iran has traditionally looked west toward Europe for trade and investment partners. Increasingly though, it has grown frustrated with European countries that have opposed Mr. Trump’s policy but quietly withdrawn from the kinds of deals that the nuclear agreement once promised. “Iran and China both view this deal as a strategic partnership in not just expanding their own interests but confronting the U.S.,” said Ali Gholizadeh, an Iranian energy researcher at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. “It is the first of its kind for Iran keen on having a world power as an ally.” The proposed partnership has nonetheless stoked a fierce debate within Iran. Mr. Zarif, the foreign minister, who traveled to Beijing last October to negotiate the agreement, faced hostile questioning about it in Parliament last week. The document was provided to The Times by someone familiar with its drafting with the intention of showing the scope of the projects now under consideration. Mr. Zarif said the agreement would be submitted to Parliament for final approval. It has the support of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, two Iranian officials said. Ayatollah Khamenei’s top economic adviser, Ali Agha Mohammadi, appeared on state television recently to discuss the need for an economic lifeline. He said Iran needs to increase its oil production to at least 8.5 million barrels a day in order to remain a player in the energy market, and for that, it needs China. Iranian supporters of the strategic partnership say that given the country’s limited economic options, the free-falling currency and the dim prospect of U.S. sanctions being lifted, the deal with China could provide a lifeline. “Every road is closed to Iran,” said Fereydoun Majlesi, a former diplomat and a columnist for several Iranian newspapers on diplomacy. “The only path open is China. Whatever it is, until sanctions are lifted, this deal is the best option.” But critics across the political spectrum in Iran have raised concerns that the government is secretly “selling off” the country to China in a moment of economic weakness and international isolation. In a speech in late June, a former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, called it a suspicious secret deal that the people of Iran would never approve. The critics have cited previous Chinese investment projects that have left countries in Africa and Asia indebted and ultimately beholden to the authorities in Beijing. A particular concern has been the proposed port facilities in Iran, including two along the coast of the Sea of Oman. One at Jask, just outside of the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance to the Persian Gulf, would give the Chinese a strategic vantage point on the waters through which much of the world’s oil transits. The passage is of critical strategic importance to the United States, whose Navy’s Fifth Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain, in the gulf. China has already constructed a series of ports along the Indian Ocean, creating a necklace of refueling and resupply stations from the South China Sea to the Suez Canal. Ostensibly commercial in nature, the ports potentially have military value, too, allowing China’s rapidly growing navy to expand its reach. Those include ports at Hambantota in Sri Lanka and Gwadar in Pakistan, which are widely criticized as footholds for a potential military presence, though no Chinese forces have officially been deployed at them. China opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti in 2015, ostensibly to support its forces participating in international antipiracy operations off the coast of Somalia. The outpost, which began as a logistics base but is now more heavily fortified, is within miles of the American base in that country. China has also stepped up military cooperation with Iran. The People’s Liberation Army Navy has visited and participated in military exercises at least three times, beginning in 2014. The most recent was last December, when a Chinese missile destroyer, the Xining, joined a naval exercise with the Russian and Iranian navies in the Gulf of Oman. China’s state-owned Xinhua news agency quoted the commander of Iran’s Navy, Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi, saying that the exercise showed “the era of American invasions in the region is over.” David E.

‘Maybe I Shouldn’t Have Come’: U.S. Visa Changes Leave Students in Limbo,2020-07-09,By Megan Specia and Maria Abi-Habib,"['LONDON — Oliver Philcox was nearing the end of his first year of graduate studies in astrophysics at Princeton University when the coronavirus outbreak began. Classes were halted in March, and then moved online. By May, he had decided to travel home to Britain. “In the long run, that was a terrible idea,” said Mr. Philcox, 24. “But I had assumed I would be able to go back in September.” Now, the return to an American institution has been thrown into question for Mr. Philcox and countless other international students after a directive by the Trump administration that students whose classes were moving entirely online for the fall would be stripped of their visas and required to leave the United States. Many universities see the move as a political one — an attempt to pressure them to reopen rather than hosting all classes online during the pandemic. For some international students, the directive poses frustrating questions of logistics and uncertainty. But for others — notably those whose home countries are embroiled in conflict or have communications technologies that are insufficient for online learning — the decision has the potential to disrupt their lives and drastically alter their futures. The Trump administration’s plan to require in-person classes for international students would affect around one million students, according to data from the 2019 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange. China sends the highest number of students — with about 370,000 enrolled in American universities in 2018-2019 — followed by India with just over 200,000 students enrolled that year. As the reality has sunk in, outrage has grown from those around the world who are now met with the possibility that they may not be able to return to, or stay in, the United States for their education. Many are rethinking whether the choice to enroll in an American institution, despite the expertise and prestige, was worth it. Macarena Ramos Gonzalez, a native of Spain who is nearing the end of a Ph.D. program in applied physiology at the University of Delaware, was blunt: “If they really don’t want me here — and the administration has made that very clear in a number of ways — maybe I shouldn’t have come.” The decision highlights a wide disconnect between the diversity that most universities strive for among students and staff members and a government that shuns those principles, she said. Hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters have signed petitions demanding that the government rethink the decision and urging their universities to protect students from abroad. Some universities are reassessing their fall reopening policies in an attempt to enable some in-person classes. Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have sued the Trump administration in federal court to block the directive, arguing that the policy is political and will upend higher education in the United States, and other universities have tried to ease students’ fears. But many remain worried. The directive has also caused confusion, as it is unclear whether some universities will even offer in-person classes or whether the restrictions apply to graduate-level research. For some international students, the United States has been a haven, offering safety from conflict in their home countries and relief from infrastructure that cannot support remote learning. But that sense of security has now been upended. In Ifat Gazia’s hometown in Kashmir, India’s government cut off internet access in August as part of moves to strengthen its grip over the disputed territory. Although the service was restored in January, only 2G is available, making it nearly impossible to make calls over Skype, let alone support the video that would be needed if she were to try to attend lectures via Zoom. Ms. Gazia arrived in the United States last August, just as India was cracking down on her region. She was unable to call her parents to let them know she had arrived safely, as the Indian government had cut landline and mobile phone service in Kashmir. “I considered myself lucky when I landed,” Ms. Gazia said. “But when this order came this week, I felt only despair.” She pointed out that higher education is often a pathway for the United States to draw in highly skilled workers. “That is what makes America great,” she said. “But so many Americans think we are just here to just take from their country. They don’t realize how much we contribute.” For students like Kunal Singh, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in political science at M.I.T., there is no way even to get home. He has been unable to fly to India, as it shut its borders in March to stem the spread of coronavirus. The anti-foreigner sentiment has also stripped away some of the prestige of graduating from a top American university. “If I had known that something like this would happen when I was applying to American schools, I wouldn’t have applied,” Mr. Singh said. “I would have applied to Australia or Britain.” For some, it isn’t worth the money or stress to continue. Andres Jaime, 48, whose 19-year-old son is a student at the Berklee School of Music in Boston, said they had decided that he would postpone his studies and return to Colombia. Mr. Jaime said they had previously asked the university to lower fees for the coming semester “because the online experience wasn’t the same,” but the university refused. The visa decision further strengthened their resolve that he should return home. Other students have begun assessing other options, like Andy Mao, 21, from Shanghai, who is studying biology at New York University. He was preparing for the Graduate Record Exam when he heard the news. This was his final year in an undergraduate program, and he had planned years of study in the United States because of its legacy as a research leader. But now, he said he would add universities in Canada and Singapore to his list. “I still like this country,” he said. “But if Trump gets re-elected, we will face huge uncertainty.” In many cases, graduate and Ph.D. students have spouses and children with them in the United States, which means that the directive will also result in the uprooting of whole families. In some cases, children will be displaced from the country that they were born in and the only country they have ever known. Among those students is Naette Lee, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in communications at the University of Maryland. Ms. Lee, 38, from Trinidad and Tobago, lives with her husband, who is Belgian, and infant son, who was born in the United States and is an American citizen. They would be unable to travel to Europe together because of a ban on nonresident travelers from the United States. And if Ms. Lee has to return home, she will be separated from her family — Trinidad and Tobago have barred foreigners from entering the country during the pandemic, which would extend to her husband and son. “This is not about the campus experience,” she said. “This is about leaving our lives behind.” Many students are even struggling to understand whether they will be affected by the directive, particularly those studying for advanced degrees that are focused on research. They would typically have no in-person classes and instead study independently. Kelsey Bryk, 29, a Canadian, left the University of Delaware in a scramble in March, driving 26 hours to her home in Winnipeg as border closings loomed. Having spent the last four years working toward a Ph.D., she may now not be able to return. “I’ve invested so much time money and effort, and now it’s just being potentially ripped away,” she said. While her university is still trying to figure out a way to ensure that international students can stay, the uncertainty looms. “Right now, I don’t think anyone has any answers,” she said. “And we are just sitting here expecting the worst and hoping for the best.” Megan Specia reported from London, and Maria Abi Habib from Los Angeles. Karan Deep Singh contributed reporting from New Delhi, Cao Li from Hong Kong and Elian Peltier and Iliana Magra from London.']",The return to studying at an American institution has been thrown into question for an estimated one million international students.
Russian Governor Is Accused of Multiple Murders as Kremlin Claws Back Powers,2020-07-10,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — After leaving Russia’s regional leaders to take much of the responsibility and heat for battling the coronavirus pandemic, the Kremlin has sent a blunt message to recently empowered local elites: Don’t even think about challenging the will of President Vladimir V. Putin. In an emphatic blow against a regional leader long viewed as disloyal, masked security officers in camouflage uniforms on Thursday arrested the governor of Khabarovsk Krai, a remote territory in the Russian Far East. The Kremlin has fired or forced sitting governors to resign in the past but rarely had them arrested. The Khabarovsk governor, Sergei I. Furgal, who took office in 2018 after defeating a Kremlin-endorsed candidate, was pulled from his vehicle and bundled into a van near his home in Khabarovsk city on suspicion of involvement in multiple murders in the early 2000s while working in business, investigators said. “The very fact that they could not find anything more fresh to accuse him of is a clear signal that this is an act of political repression,” Nikolai Petrov, a political analyst who studies regional politics, said in a telephone interview “They are telling local elites that if they can arrest a sitting governor for crimes going back 15 or 20 years then they can arrest anyone.” Like many Russian politicians, particularly in far-flung provinces, Mr. Furgal, a former timber and scrap metal trader who entered politics as a member of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, has a murky past that may have included criminal activity. But he has held elected positions in local and national legislatures for years without investigators showing any interest in his supposed propensity for murder. Mr. Furgal, who was flown to Moscow immediately after his arrest in Khabarovsk, appeared in court in the Russian capital on Friday and pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder. He was remanded in custody until Sept. 9. Fear of having crimes, both real and fabricated, from the past suddenly revived by the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., and other arms of Russia’s vast law-enforcement system has helped glue Russia’s political elite together for years. The decision to investigate Mr. Furgal’s putative crimes after so many years suggests the Kremlin is anxious that elite obedience could be fraying. His sudden arrest on Thursday, analysts say, signals an effort by the Kremlin to claw back some of the autonomy granted to provincial leaders in the early stage of Russia’s coronavirus crisis. Eager to avoid blame for unpopular lockdown decisions, Mr. Putin retreated to his country residence outside Moscow and largely left governors to decide how to respond. But opinion polls suggest that this strategy backfired politically, increasing public trust in provincial leaders while eroding confidence in Mr. Putin, who lost his aura as a can-do man of action. Abbas Gallyamov, a former speech writer for Mr. Putin, said that the take-down of Khabarovsk’s governor was a message to provincial officials across the country: “Do not try to imagine that the ‘coronavirus federalization’ is serious.” Now that the battle against the virus has been declared won by Mr. Putin, Mr. Glayamov said, in a post on Facebook “all power that was transferred during the epidemic must now be brought back intact.” The arrest opened a new front in a rolling crackdown undertaken after a recent national plebiscite that gave Mr. Putin the option of ignoring previous constitutional term limits, which would have forced him to step down in 2024, and staying in power until at least 2036. Voters overwhelmingly approved a series of constitutional amendments scripted by the Kremlin, which declared the outcome a “triumphant referendum on confidence” in Mr. Putin. But the exercise was so transparently rigged from the start that it left the president, whose approval rating has slumped to its lowest level since he took power 20 years ago, looking more reliant than ever on cheerleading by state media, dirty tricks and subterfuge. A respected electoral researcher estimated that more than 20 million votes, more than a quarter of those cast, had been falsified. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the far-right party of which Mr. Furgal is a member, protested the governor’s arrest, threatening that his supporters in the national parliament might resign. “We gave you the constitution, and you’re putting us in handcuffs,” Mr. Zhirinovsky said in a warning to the Kremlin, which he usually supports. While not mentioning Mr. Putin by name, Mr. Zhirinovsky took aim at the president, saying: “Shameless! You are sitting in high office and start acting like Stalin!” Tass news agency reported on Friday that security officers had raided the homes of five members of Mr. Zhirinosky’s party in Khabarovsk in connection with the murder investigation into the arrested governor. In the days since voting on the amended constitution ended on July 1, the F.S.B. has spearheaded a series of moves to stifle criticism of Mr. Putin and the security services that anchor his rule. On Monday, a court in western Russia convicted a freelance reporter on terrorism-related charges initiated by the F.S.B. that even the Kremlin’s own human rights council had — before being purged of independent-minded members — dismissed as unwarranted. A day later, the F.S.B. arrested a highly regarded former journalist who had worked in recent months for the Russian space agency, accusing him of treason for passing secrets to an unnamed NATO country. A small protest outside the F.S.B. headquarters was quickly broken up by the police. On Thursday, security officers searched the homes in Moscow and elsewhere of opposition activists involved with Open Russia, a group highly critical of the Kremlin. Also raided were the home of the editor-in-chief of an independent online publication and the residences of independent politicians who have tried to challenge Kremlin candidates in local elections. The Kremlin has grown increasingly uneasy about its ability to control the outcome of local polls since gubernatorial elections in 2018, when Mr. Furgal, the governor arrested on Thursday, and candidates in a few other regions defeated Kremlin-endorsed rivals. Voters in Mr. Frugal’s region, Khabarovsk Krai, which shares a border with China, last week endorsed Mr. Putin’s constitutional changes, but by smaller margin than elsewhere. Sixty two percent voted “yes” in Khabarovsk, compared with a national tally of 78 percent in favor. More damaging for Mr. Furgal’s standing in the Kremlin, however, was probably the fact the turnout in his region was only 42 percent. Governors are expected to mobilize at least a majority of voters to the polls to demonstrate their loyalty to the Kremlin and keep their jobs. The state-controlled news agency Tass blamed Mr. Frugal’s troubles on his performance as governor, quoting analysts as saying that he had failed to deliver on promises of an economic revival for Khabarovsk. By that standard, however, Mr. Putin and virtually every elected official in Russia should have been arrested or at least lost his job long ago. Kostantin Kalachev, a political analyst who used to work for the ruling United Russia party, said Mr. Frugal’s arrest so many years after his purported crimes was “an unequivocal signal” to all candidates in upcoming gubernatorial elections in September who are not backed by the Kremlin: “If there is the slightest chance of success do not even try.” Victory, Mr. Kalachev wrote in a commentary on Facebook, will ensure “your life will not be all milk and honey.” Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.']",The arrest of a popular regional leader in eastern Russia on suspicion of decades-old crimes sent a blunt warning to local elites empowered by the coronavirus pandemic.
"In Singapore, an Orderly Election and a (Somewhat) Surprising Result",2020-07-10,By Hannah Beech,"['Face-masked citizens lined up to vote in Singapore on Friday, with plenty of space separating them from each other. Their temperatures had been checked. Before receiving their ballots, they spritzed their hands with sanitizer, and many put on disposable gloves. If any country could successfully carry out a general election during a global pandemic, it was surely Singapore, a rich, manicured city-state with a population that has largely been conditioned to follow the rules. The winner was never in doubt, either, even though balloting was extended by two hours to accommodate the long lines. But while victory went to the center-right People’s Action Party, which has held power longer than any other elected political party in the world, results released early Saturday showed a surprising slip in its support. Its share of the popular vote fell to 61 percent, a nearly nine-point swing from elections five years ago. The leading opposition party took a record 10 of Parliament’s 93 seats. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the 68-year-old son of the nation’s founding father, said he would stay at the helm until the coronavirus crisis passed, and he acknowledged his weakened mandate. “The results reflect the pain and anxiety that Singaporeans feel in this crisis, the loss of income, the anxiety about jobs,” Mr. Lee said early Saturday morning. If calling an election during a pandemic was meant to showcase the steady hand of a party that has used Singapore’s greatest strengths — deep coffers, technocratic professionalism and a belief in science and technology — to battle the coronavirus, the campaign also highlighted divisions in a society that, like many others in the developed world, is struggling with a changing geopolitical and economic landscape. Several of the parliamentary races proved surprisingly competitive, and high-profile candidates from the governing party lost their contests. Besides adding four seats to its previous showing, the opposition Workers’ Party won more than 10 percent of the popular vote for the first time. “Singapore rode the wave of globalization to great heights, but with Covid, we’re entering a period of deglobalization that leaves Singapore’s economy very vulnerable,” Bridget Welsh, a political scientist focused on Southeast Asia, said before the results were announced. “From the outside, Singapore looks like a great success story and in many ways it is, but there are legitimate questions being raised about what it aspires to be in this new era,” Ms. Welsh added. The People’s Action Party promised, above all, stability and competence. Having led Singapore since even before independence in 1965, the party claims credit for transforming a resource-starved backwater on the tip of peninsular Southeast Asia into one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. The coronavirus has ripped through crowded dormitories housing 200,000 foreign laborers, infecting tens of thousands, but Singapore has kept its death toll from the pandemic to just 26 people. Job losses and a looming recession have been blunted by a relief effort costing more than $70 billion, the People’s Action Party said. While Singapore has no minimum wage and at least 10 percent of its households are considered poor by some estimates, extensive public housing for citizens ensures a kind of social safety net, according to the governing party. For the 10 opposition parties that ran against the People’s Action Party, the campaign was less an attempt to unseat a political behemoth than an effort to inject different viewpoints into the national conversation. The smallest mandate the governing party has ever received was a 60 percent victory in 2011, a shade worse than Friday’s showing. “What we are trying to deny them is a blank check, and that is what I think this election is about,” Jamus Lim, an economist and candidate for the Workers’ Party, said in an online debate during the campaign.  Mr. Lim won a seat in Parliament. Singapore’s political strictures, along with social distancing measures, put even more roadblocks in the way of an opposition trying to gather momentum. The campaign season was only nine days long. A “fake news” law that came into force last year was seen as having a chilling effect on online debate. Because of the coronavirus restrictions, electoral rallies were banned. Nor was electoral polling allowed. The short campaign period was dominated by personal vitriol, particularly a spat between Mr. Lee and his younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, a former brigadier general and business executive who joined the opposition Progress Singapore Party last month. Their father, Lee Kuan Yew, co-founded the People’s Action Party and served as prime minister for more than three decades. The senior Mr. Lee steered the ethnically Chinese-dominated city-state to independence in 1965, after it broke off from the new country of Malaysia. He embraced rules and order, championing Confucian virtues. Today, most Singaporeans are still of Chinese descent, but about 40 percent of the country’s 5.7 million residents are foreign-born. Under racial harmony laws, people who stoke religious or racial enmity can spend up to three years in jail. Last year, Heng Swee Keat, the deputy prime minister and presumptive successor to Mr. Lee, said that older Singaporeans were “not ready” for a leader who is not ethnically Chinese. Mr. Heng won his race on Friday by a relatively narrow margin. \u200bOn Sunday, Raeesah Khan, a \u200b\u200bcandidate for the Workers’ Party\u200b\u200b, apologized for comments on social media that accused the police of treating ethnic minorities and migrant workers more harshly than whites or rich Chinese. Her commentary prompted the filing of two police reports, the Singapore police confirmed. “Systemic racism is a reality in Singapore,” said Jolovan Wham, a social worker and activist who has campaigned for migrant workers’ rights. Members of ethnic minority groups have feared that if they publicly challenge racism, they may be subjected to investigations by the police, said Mr. Wham, who spent a week in prison this year for criticizing Singapore’s courts. “Self-censorship has become the norm,” he added. “The lack of freedom of expression in Singapore has made it difficult to have authentic and honest debates about important issues affecting us.” Still, Ms. Khan won a seat in Parliament. At 26, she will be the youngest member of the legislature. Young Singaporeans, some of whom have expressed their political views in boisterous online forums, are part of a global discourse about privilege and power, said Donald Low, a former high-ranking civil servant in Singapore who now teaches at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Some prominent members of the governing party have pushed back against the notion that they are beneficiaries of a system that unfairly rewards an ethnically Chinese elite. “To deny to young ethnic minorities that a well-to-do Chinese man isn’t privileged, that there isn’t prejudice in society, is incredibly patronizing,” said Mr. Low. At a news conference early Saturday, Mr. Lee acknowledged that the country’s youth were yearning for a diversity of political voices. “The younger voters also want to see more opposition presence in Parliament,” he said.  Singapore’s prosperity depends on the sweat of its million or so low-wage migrant workers, who help keep the city neat, efficient and breathtakingly modern. Unlike other expatriates who can eventually qualify for permanent residency, these migrants, who are mostly from South Asia and China, work in Singapore knowing they are temporary members of society. Labor activists have warned over the years that their dormitories, relegated to the periphery of the island state, are petri dishes for disease, and it is perhaps no surprise that the vast majority of Singapore’s more than 45,600 coronavirus cases are among this population. The government has said it will build more facilities for foreign laborers, but it has pushed back against criticism that it ignored migrants’ working conditions to their peril. Most migrants who have tested positive were asymptomatic or barely sick, health authorities have said. “The setting up of new dorms with more space is not a silver bullet,” K. Shanmugam, Singapore’s law minister, said in an interview. Cruise ships, he noted, are luxurious, yet the coronavirus still spread quickly within their shared spaces. But the public health crisis among Singapore’s migrant workers has catalyzed a debate about the fundamental structure of the nation’s hyper-globalized economy. “The real problem is our overreliance on low-cost foreign labor,” said Mr. Low, a former director of fiscal policy at the Singaporean ministry of finance. “What this has revealed,” he added, “is not just systemic injustice for foreign workers, but also something that is a stain on Singapore’s veneer of technocratic modernity and superior governance.”']","The People’s Action Party, which has never been out of power, won yet again, but by a narrower margin than usual. The opposition had sought to deny it “a blank check.”"
"Bolivia President, Jeanine Añez, Tests Positive for Coronavirus",2020-07-10,By Maria Silvia Trigo and Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['TARIJA, Bolivia — President Jeanine Añez said Thursday that she has tested positive for the coronavirus, highlighting how the pandemic is spreading to Latin America’s highest echelons of power. Ms. Añez, a caretaker leader who took office after the controversial ouster of Bolivia’s first Indigenous president in November, said in a video posted on social media that she felt fine and would work remotely in quarantine for 14 days. But her infection could further complicate Bolivia’s tense political situation because Ms. Añez has no clearly identified deputy who could assume her functions if she becomes seriously ill. Ms. Añez is the second Latin America leader this week, after President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, to disclose an infection, a sign that the region is at the epicenter of the pandemic. Numerous lower-ranking political leaders in the region have also tested positive in recent weeks, including four government ministers in Bolivia. The president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, was hospitalized in mid-June with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Latin America accounted for half the new cases in the world last week, and Brazil alone had 25 percent of new global infections, the World Health Organization said. About 140,000 people have died from the virus in Latin America, according to the W.H.O., although most governments acknowledge that limited testing and record-keeping hide the true toll. While Bolivia has been able to escape the dramatic outbreaks that have ripped through neighboring Brazil, Peru and Chile, the pandemic is beginning to spread quickly in the poor highland nation. Bolivia has reported nearly 43,000 infections and over 1,500 deaths. The government’s pandemic response has been tainted by a corruption scandal over the purchase of hospital ventilators, which led to the resignation and house arrest of the health minister. Ms. Añez’s political rivals have accused her of using state resources earmarked for the pandemic to benefit her election campaign. Despite originally promising to stand down after the end of her caretaker term, Ms. Añez is now seeking to keep her office in the September general elections. As with many of its neighbors, Bolivia’s strict quarantine has gradually unraveled. The government’s limited economic aid to citizens has failed to prevent the nation’s poorest from venturing onto the streets to earn money for food and rent. The country is partially lifting restrictions now to resuscitate its ailing economy. Ms. Añez rose suddenly to prominence following the chaotic resignation of President Evo Morales, whose attempt to secure a fourth term as president plunged the country into chaos and forced him into exile. A quirk in Bolivian Constitution made Ms. Añez, then a senator from a remote tropical region, the caretaker president until the new elections.']","Ms. Añez is the second Latin America leader this week, after President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, to disclose an infection, a sign the region is at the epicenter of the global outbreak."

The elephant-headed deity was shown on the floor, near a bejeweled Aladdin lamp, as a member of the band preened and rapped on a golden throne. That glimpse of Ganesha in the video for “How You Like That” was enough for eagle-eyed K-pop fans, many of them in India, to unleash a torrent of criticism against Blackpink last month, accusing the group of cultural appropriation, of using the religious object as a prop and of defiling it by placing it on the ground. They demanded that the image be removed. “No hate to the artists but our hindu religion and Gods aren’t a toy/prop/aesthetic for pop culture music videos to use,” a fan from Delhi with the user name Iam_drish wrote on Twitter, adding that it wasn’t the first time Indian and Southeast Asian culture had been disrespected by K-pop. As the tempest grew, Ganesha suddenly vanished from the video posted on YouTube, and fans declared victory. On Wednesday, Blackpink’s management acknowledged that it had edited the deity out, saying in a statement that its use had been an “unintentional mistake.” The swift re-editing of the Blackpink video illustrated how K-pop fans, who are deeply invested in the mythmaking of their musical idols, use the internet to spread their messages, reach the artists (and their management) almost instantly and get quick results. K-pop, fueled by highly choreographed musical performances, is South Korea’s biggest cultural export. The country’s music industry generated more than $5 billion in revenue in 2018, most of it from K-pop, according to a white paper published by the Korea Creative Content Agency in March. YG Entertainment, the agency that manages Blackpink, made $220 million in revenue in 2019. But the fans are key to the phenomenon, and they know it. They have helped to propel bands like Blackpink to stardom by coordinating mass postings and stunts on social media before an album release or a star’s birthday — in some cases, even pooling their money to buy subway ads. Blackpink, whose members use the stage names Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa (real names Ji-soo Kim, Jennie Kim, Roseanne Park and Lalisa Manoban), has more than 100 million followers across social media platforms. But K-pop fans — an internet-savvy army that spans the globe and counts members of different races, ages and social-economic strata among its ranks — are also pushing their idols to be socially progressive. They have become more politically active, claiming to have targeted an Oklahoma rally for President Trump’s campaign by registering for thousands of tickets with no intention of showing up. K-pop groups are also reaching across cultural boundaries to find new muses. The boy band BTS was praised for “Idol,” a song released in 2018 that was infused with Afro-beats and Korean folk rhythms. But bands have also stumbled over cultural and racial red lines. The inclusion of religious and socially sensitive motifs for their opulent-looking video backdrops and candy-colored costumes has led to accusations of cultural misappropriation. Members of Blackpink, for example, were criticized for wearing bindis and box braids. Ganesha was the latest cultural touchstone to stir up the fan base. YG Entertainment, Blackpink’s agency, was bombarded by social media posts and emails, some of which followed a fan-created template. Fans demanded a public apology and the Ganesha statue’s removal. On June 30, the agency uploaded a new version of the “How You Like That”\xa0video without the deity. “It was immediately edited when we became aware of it,” said a YG representative, Cho Woo-young. Vedansh Varshney, a 21-year-old university student and K-pop fan from Delhi, said of K-pop’s cultural mash-ups: “Some people will feel like our culture is represented. But this is not the situation at all when it becomes disrespectful.” The list of comparable K-pop scandals includes a 2016 social media post by Taeyang, a singer with the band Big Bang, who used an app to merge his face with an image of Kanye West and wish his followers a “Happy Monkey New Year.” In 2017, the group Mamamoo performed a parody of “Uptown Funk” in blackface. In 2018, an old photograph circulated online showing a member of the K-pop band BTS wearing a hat with a badge resembling Nazi insignia. A photograph of another band member in a T-shirt with a picture evoking the atomic bombing of Japan by the United States had already been widely shared. Apologies followed, along with suggestions that cultural ignorance was to blame. But some ask why the bands keep making similar mistakes. Some experts point to South Korea’s history to explain the prism through which K-pop artists distill foreign influences and inspiration. “When you take elements of a culture and use it in a way that demeans or ridicules the people in that culture, that’s disrespectful,” said Crystal Anderson, an affiliate Korean studies faculty member at George Mason University. “What is often left out of the conversation is how those images and their creators got to places like East Asia in the first place,” Dr. Anderson said by telephone.  South Korea was largely cut off from the outside world during the Cold War, with many newspapers, books and films banned by military dictators. As the country opened up in the 1990s, many looked to America as a model for cultural success. But some racist tropes were imported and replicated during a campaign called “Let’s learn from Hollywood,” scholars say. “When foreign cultures came into Korea, they arrived through the lens of mainstream American media, making the situation prone to distortion,” said Shim Doobo, a professor of media and communication at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul. “K-pop has grown faster than the industry had time to raise issues with or reflect on their problematic behavior,” Dr. Shim added. Even as fans chastise K-pop stars for using offensive images, it is unclear how many independent artistic choices the singers are allowed to make. The groups are tightly managed by agencies that dictate virtually every detail of their public lives, from their appearance to their romantic relationships. Discussions of racism in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis have also led to calls for change in K-pop. Last month, many praised BTS’s donation of $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, following up with donations of their own. But Black fans also renewed longstanding critiques about K-pop, particularly what they saw as a refusal to recognize the genre’s influences in Black music, dance and culture. Still, though all the controversies — even the unholy pairing of a Hindu god with gyrating musical stars — the international army of K-pop fans has remained fiercely loyal. Mr. Varshney, the student from Delhi, said the genre had inspired him to shuck off traditional macho behavior and a hypermasculine appearance. He started learning Korean three years ago to understand the lyrics, and he mashes up K-pop choreography with Bollywood music. But Mr. Varshney wants his K-pop idols to include more nuanced portrayals of other cultures in the music he loves. “If there is a pattern and we don’t speak out about it, it will keep happening,” he said.']",A tempest over the band Blackpink’s use of a Hindu god in a video was the latest example of K-pop fans holding artists to account — while staying fiercely loyal.
South Korean Triathlete’s Suicide Exposes Team’s Culture of Abuse,2020-07-09,By Choe Sang-Hun,"[""SEOUL, South Korea — Just after midnight on June 26, Choi Suk-hyeon, a promising South Korean triathlete, sent two text messages. The first, to a teammate, asked for help looking after her pet dog. The other, to her mother, was more ominous. In that message Ms. Choi, 22, told her mother how much she loved her, before adding: “Mom, please make the world know the crimes they have committed.” To her parents and former teammates, it was clear who she meant by “they.” After Ms. Choi committed suicide, her family released a spiral-bound diary and secret recordings in which the young triathlete documented years of physical and psychological abuse she said she suffered at the hands of her team’s coach, doctor and two senior teammates. In one recording, the team’s doctor, Ahn Ju-hyeon, can be heard repeatedly hitting her. “Lock your jaws! Come here!” Mr. Ahn is heard saying in the March 2019 recording, followed by a series of thudding strikes. The diaries and recordings, which were reviewed by The New York Times, have set off a firestorm of criticism and national soul searching about the corruption and abuse that has long pervaded the country’s sports community. On Monday, the Korea Triathlon Federation banned the coach, Kim Gyu-bong, and \u200bthe team captain, Jang Yun-jeong, from the sport\u200b for life\u200b. Prosecutors were also preparing criminal charges against them, as well as Mr. Ahn. Mr. Ahn, who was referred to as a doctor, but reportedly does not hold a medical degree, did not answer calls or respond to messages seeking comment and has made no public comments about the case. During a parliamentary hearing on Monday, Mr. Kim, Ms. Jang and Kim Do-hwan, another athlete accused of bullying Ms. Choi, all denied the accusations. South Korea has taken pride in its growing prowess as a global sports powerhouse, with its top athletes winning Olympic gold medals and other prizes. But recurring scandals have revealed widespread physical violence, sexual assault and other forms of abuse against athletes, many of whom are young, vulnerable and live away from their families during training. Young athletes live together in dormitories and routinely skip classes to attend practices, leaving them with few career choices outside of sports. Such a system gives coaches exceptional power over athletes, and other victims have said they were afraid to earlier speak up for fear they would be left without careers, and ostracized by their teammates. In a rare example of a Korean athlete speaking out, Shim Suk-hee, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in short-track speedskating, shocked the country last year by accusing her former coach of raping her repeatedly since she was 17. The coach, Cho Jae-beom, was sentenced to 10 months in prison for physically assaulting four athletes, including Ms. Shim, between 2011 and the preparations for the 2018 Winter Olympics held in Pyeongchang, South Korea. He is still fighting the rape charges in court. The Korean cases are part of a larger global trend in which female athletes are speaking out about physical, emotional and sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches and team doctors. In the United States, Larry Nassar, a doctor, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for molesting scores of girls, many of them Olympic gymnasts, under the guise of giving them examinations. While it is hard to fully understand her mind-set, Ms. Choi, 22, had sought help, filing complaints and petitions with the authorities. In the months leading up to her suicide, she had reported her case to the National Human Rights Commission, the Korea Triathlon Federation, the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee, and the police in Gyeongju City, where the team was based. Ms. Choi told the authorities, in complaints reviewed by The Times, that Mr. Ahn had slapped, punched and kicked her more than 20 times on the day she made the recording, and fractured one of her ribs. She said she did not seek medical treatment at the time for fear of retaliation. “She had been stressed out lately because the officials she appealed to acted as if some beating and abuse should be taken for granted in the sport,” said Ms. Choi's father, Choi Young-hee. The authorities, he said, told Ms. Choi “that the accused denied any wrongdoing and that they didn’t have enough evidence to act, even though \u200bwe gave them the audio files.” “Our country may have advanced \u200ba \u200blot in other sectors, but the human rights in our sports remain stuck in the 1970s and ’80s,” \u200bsaid Mr. Choi\u200b, a farmer. “Who is going to bring back my daughter alive?” In a diary she began keeping last year, Ms. Choi extensively described beating, bullying and other abuse. “I wish I were dead,” Ms. Choi wrote last July. “I wish that I were run over by a car while walking on the street or stabbed to death by a robber while asleep.” Ms. Choi wondered whether she was “insane” or “paranoid,” as she said her abusers called her. Ms. Choi later told the authorities that she was beaten by the doctor in March 2019 during a training trip to New Zealand as punishment for eating a peach despite her coach’s order to lose weight. In the audio recording from that day, Ms. Choi sniffled and begged for mercy, repeatedly saying, “I am sorry, sir.” “Mr. Team Doctor is beating you for your own good,” the coach, Kim Gyu-bong, told Ms. Choi. “Stop whining!” he said. “Or I will beat you dead myself!” \u200bMs. Choi, a child swimming prodigy, was selected in 2015 for the junior national triathlon team and earned three gold medals. After graduating from high school in 2017, she joined the elite triathlon team in Gyeongju. The bullying, hazing and gaslighting began when Ms. Choi, then still a high school student, was allowed to train with the adult \u200bteam in \u200bGyeongju\u200b, she said in her complaints. Ms. Choi said that much of the verbal abuse was led by Ms. Jang, the team’s star athlete and a national champion. In her statements to the authorities, Ms. Choi said Ms. Jang “struck my head, pushed and punched me and repeatedly called me names.” She said Ms. Jang humiliated her in front of other teammates by calling her sexually promiscuous. In one instance, Ms. Choi said, the team’s coach forced her to kneel in front of Ms. Jang. She cited Ms. Jang’s bullying as one of the main reasons she left the team for a year to seek medical help. \u200bWhile training in New Zealand in 2016, Ms. Choi later told the authorities, her coach slapped her with a shoe. That same year, the coach and team doctor \u200bforced Ms. Choi and another athlete to eat $168 worth of bread. They were made to eat and vomit and eat again until early in the morning, Ms. Choi said. Ms. Choi was chosen for the national team in 2018, but took the year off to receive medical counseling. “I am back in New Zealand and this is a new start!” she wrote in her diary in January 2019 after rejoining the team for its annual training season there. “I can make a fantastic comeback! I can do it! Let’s go!” But the abuse resumed. “We basically like you. All the coaching staff cheer for you, but you cheated us,” the team doctor, \u200bMr. Ahn, was recorded telling Ms. Choi. He indicated that he was punishing her because she had complained about the beatings to outsiders. In one recording from Ms. Choi’s smartphone, her coach, Mr. Kim, can be heard hitting her once. In another, he calls her “psychotic” and orders her not to eat for three days to avoid gaining weight. This year, Ms. Choi left Gyeongju for another team, and began filing complaints against her former teammates, coach and doctor. Her coach, as well as Ms. Jang and Kim Do-hwan, another athlete accused of bullying Ms. Choi, did not respond to messages seeking comment and the team has not released a statement on their behalf. It was unknown if any of the three had already obtained legal counsel. It was also unknown if Mr. Ahn, the team doctor, was represented by a lawyer.  In addition to looking into the abuse claims, prosecutors have also opened an investigation into money the coaching staff and Ms. Jang \u200bregularly collected from \u200b team members in the name of covering air travel\u200b, “psychological therapy” and other expenses, although the team was financed by Gyeongju City. Ms. Choi’s family alone wired more than $23,000 to them. After Ms. Choi’s suicide, several former teammates came forward to corroborate her allegations and share stories of their own abuse, according to Lee Yong, a former coach of South Korea’s Olympic bobsled and skeleton team, who is now an opposition lawmaker. In a news conference on Monday, two former teammates of Ms. Choi said the team was a “kingdom” ruled by the coach, Mr. Kim, and his star athlete, Ms. Jang. The women said they were beaten 10 days per month and verbal abuse was common. \u200bThe two athletes who spoke at the news conference on Monday said Mr. Ahn had touched \u200btheir breasts and thighs in the name of physical therapy. The news media in South Korea granted the two athletes anonymity ahead of the news conference. “We joined the Gyeongju team fresh out of high school\u200b. Although we dreaded the oppression and violence of the coach and the captain, everyone hushed \u200bthe matter,” one of the women said. “We thought this was the life we had to \u200bendure as athletes.” If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.""]","After Choi Suk-hyeon’s death, her family released secret audio recordings that depict the physical and psychological abuse she appeared to suffer at the hands of her team’s doctor and coach."
Erdogan Signs Decree Allowing Hagia Sophia to Be Used as a Mosque Again,2020-07-10,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a decree Friday ordering Hagia Sophia to be opened for Muslim prayers, an action likely to provoke international furor around a World Heritage Site cherished by Christians and Muslims alike for its religious significance, for its stunning structure and as a symbol of conquest. The presidential decree came minutes after a Turkish court announced that it had revoked Hagia Sophia’s status as a museum, which for the last 80 years had made it a monument of relative harmony and a symbol of the secularism that was part of the foundation of the modern Turkish state. Built in the sixth century as a cathedral, Hagia Sophia stands as the greatest example of Byzantine Christian architecture in the world. But it has been a source of Christian-Muslim rivalry, having stood at the center of Christendom for nearly a millennium and then, after being conquered, of the Muslim Ottoman Empire, when it was last used as a mosque. Mr. Erdogan’s decree transferred control of the site to the Religious Affairs Directorate, sealing the removal of its museum status and allowing Hagia Sophia to become a working mosque once again. It was a decision long sought by conservative Muslims in Turkey and beyond, but one which opponents say Mr. Erdogan intends to stir his nationalist and religious base as his popularity wanes after 18 years atop Turkish politics. In a post on Twitter that included a copy of the decree, Mr. Erdogan simply wrote “Hayirli olsun,’’ or “Congratulations.” Immediately after the announcement a small crowd gathered outside Hagia Sophia, some of them chanting “Allahu akbar,” or “God is great.” Television footage showed police placing barriers across the entrance to the monument. It was not immediately clear how the ruling would change life around the monument. Cevdet Yilmaz, the deputy chairman responsible for foreign affairs for Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., said the government would determine how to carry out the change. Mr. Erdogan defended the decision as Turkey’s right and said it represented the will of many Turks. He added that the action of turning it from a mosque into a museum 80 years ago had been illegal, but pledged that the mosque would continue to be open to Muslims and non-Muslims alike. “Hagia Sophia, the common heritage of humanity, will go forward to embrace everyone with its new status in a much more sincere and much more unique way,’’ he said in a live television address. Entry to the monument would be free of charge, foregoing the ticket price from several million visitors a year, and the first prayers inside Hagia Sophia will take place on July 24. Just before he spoke, several hundred people gathered outside Hagia Sophia to celebrate a prayer of thanksgiving, recording the call of the muezzin on their phones, and then bent in unison for the evening prayer on the esplanade in front of the building. Mr. Erdogan may choose to hold prayers only on ceremonial occasions, as he did to mark the anniversary of the Ottoman conquest of the city in May. But his supporters may demand freedom to enter the building for daily prayers. Conservationists and art historians have raised concerns about what will happen to the medieval mosaics inside Hagia Sophia, which depict the Holy Family and portraits of imperial Christian emperors, which strict Muslims may demand be covered. Tour guides said that the building may be closed to tourists during prayer times, or even that parts of the building be sectioned off to non-Muslims. A.K.P. party officials suggested holding the first Muslim prayers in Hagia Sophia, or Ayasofya by its Turkish name, on July 15 to mark the anniversary of a failed coup in 2016 against Mr. Erdogan’s government, during a discussion about the change of status in June, the Turkish daily, Hurriyet, reported. The court decision came as the culmination of a four-year campaign by an obscure cultural association that made legal applications to restore a number of monuments, including several Byzantine churches, as mosques. Hagia Sophia will be the fourth Byzantine church museum to be restored as a mosque under Mr. Erdogan, but by far the most significant one. In November, the famous Chora monastery church in Istanbul had its status as a museum revoked. When the plan for Hagia Sophia was floated, it met a chorus of dismay from religious and political leaders around the world. The ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew, who is the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church from his seat in Istanbul, said the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque would disappoint millions of Christians around the world and divide Muslims and Christians since it had long been a place of worship for both. Hagia Sophia, famous for the grandeur of its immense and iconic dome, was converted into a mosque after Mehmed II the Conqueror held his first Friday prayers there in 1453, three days after seizing control of what was then the city of Constantinople. Under the secular republic of modern Turkey, the monument was turned into a museum in 1934. It was named a masterpiece of the World Heritage site in Istanbul and has become Turkey’s most popular tourist attraction, drawing 3.7 million visitors last year. Mr. Erdogan had voiced his intention to convert Hagia Sophia into a mosque several times. In May, he gave a strong indication that he would follow through on the plan when — remotely, because of the coronavirus — he opened a ceremony to commemorate the 567th anniversary of the conquest of Istanbul. An imam recited a verse from the Quran, known as the Conquest surah, celebrating the Treaty of Hudaibiyah between the people of Mecca and Medina. The idea of converting Hagia Sophia back into a mosque prompted immediate pushback from Greece, which sees itself as the heir to the Byzantine Empire. The Greek Foreign Ministry denounced the conversion as unacceptable and a breach of Hagia Sophia’s status as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. In a strongly worded statement, the Greek culture minister, Lina Mendoni, condemned Turkey’s decision as a “direct challenge to the entire civilized world,” adding that Mr. Erdogan’s nationalism had pushed the country back six centuries. “President Erdogan has chosen for Turkey its cultural isolation,” she said. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s senior diplomat, called Turkey’s decision regrettable. In its own statement on Friday, UNESCO said that Hagia Sophia is inscribed on its world heritage list as a museum which binds the Turkish state to ensure that “no modification is made to the outstanding universal value of the property.” The organization added that communities and others concerned with the property should be ensured inclusive and equitable access to the monument. Presidential spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said Hagia Sophia could be a working mosque and be open to visitors in the same way that Notre Dame cathedral and the Sacre Coeur basilica in France hold services and are open to tourists. “The opening of Hagia Sophia for worship does not prevent local or foreign tourists from visiting the place,” he said. The change of status would also not affect the World Heritage status of the historic peninsula which encompasses the Ottoman Topkapi Palace, and ancient hippodrome and the Blue Mosque, he added. “Opening this place to worship will not make Hagia Sophia lose anything from its world heritage identity,” he said in an interview with Anadolu Agency. “People can keep going there and visit the place. As our ancestors protected the Christian icons there, they will continue to be protected.” But supporters of the move were increasingly triumphant on social media. Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, who is also son-in-law to Mr. Erdogan, tweeted a phrase from a well known conservative nationalist poet: “As master Necip Fazil Kisakurek said 55 years ago: ‘Wait, youngsters. Either today or tomorrow, Hagia Sophia will be opened.’” Huseyin Gulerce, a pro-government columnist for the Star newspaper reprinted a column he had written 30 years ago in which he had criticized the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a museum as an unnecessary gesture of deference to the West that cast a “dark shadow” over Turkish independence. “We want back what already belonged to us,” Mr. Gulerce wrote. “We want back what was cut off from our history, faith, culture, national dignity, state honor.” “The hesitations of ‘But what would the United States, the West say?’ should be removed over this country,” he wrote then. “If you open Hagia Sophia you would make our dignified nation happy.’’ Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.']",The decree came after a Turkish court revoked the site’s 80-year-old status as a museum and is likely to provoke an international furor.
The Netherlands Brings Russia to Court Over the Downing of MH17,2020-07-10,By Thomas Erdbrink,"['AMSTERDAM — The Dutch government is taking Russia to the European Court of Human Rights over the downing nearly six years ago of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine. The Netherlands, home to roughly two-thirds of the victims, made the move to provide “maximum support” to individual cases brought to the European court by victims’ relatives, the country’s foreign minister, Stef Blok, wrote in a letter to the Dutch Parliament released on Friday. All 298 people on the flight were killed after a Buk surface-to-air missile from territory controlled by pro-Moscow Ukrainian rebels downed the plane on July 17, 2014, when it was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. “Achieving justice for 298 victims of the downing of Flight MH17 is and will remain the government’s highest priority,” Mr. Blok said in a statement. “By taking this step today — bringing a case before the European Court of Human Rights and thus supporting the applications of the next of kin as much as we can — we are moving closer to this goal.” Taking Russia to court enables the Netherlands to help the families of victims who are also seeking legal redress, by providing at least some of the evidence they need to prove their claims, Mr. Blok said in an interview. “Many relatives have begun procedures and have now entered a phase where they need evidence. We have that evidence and providing it to the court by starting this procedure is the best way to help them,” he said. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, described Friday’s step as “another blow” to the relationship between Russia and the Netherlands. “The Hague took the path from the very beginning of placing all blame on Russia for the crash of Flight MH17,” Ms. Zakharova said in a statement. “We believe that this step will only lead to further politicization and will complicate the search for the truth.” Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the tragedy, despite growing evidence that the plane was shot down by a Russian antiaircraft missile sent into eastern Ukraine from a Russian military base across the border. In the local criminal court case, the Dutch authorities said they had more than 300 witnesses, intercepted calls and messages, and radar data to support their conclusions. Instead of addressing the evidence, Moscow has generated a series of highly implausible counterexplanations and conspiracy theories that have mostly focused on blaming Ukraine and attacking the legitimacy of the investigation. Ukraine was fighting Russia-backed separatists in the country’s east when the missile brought down MH17.  The aircraft broke up in the sky, scattering debris and bodies across a vast area that was controlled by separatist forces. Western governments and investigators have blamed both the Russian government and Russian-backed rebels fighting the Ukrainian government. Moscow has denied any involvement. An  investigative team of police officers from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine found that the antiaircraft missile used to shoot the plane down had been carried from a Russian military base across the border shortly before it was fired. International prosecutors indicted four men in June 2019, three of whom had ties to Russia’s intelligence and military agencies, and the other from Ukraine, charging them with murder. A trial against the men started in March in a district court in the Netherlands and is expected to resume in August, according to the Dutch court. The suspects are being tried in absentia. Russia is a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, and by this, is bound to respect any decision by the court. The Netherlands and other countries have been in diplomatic contact with Russia in an effort to get the country to cooperate in the investigation, but there haven’t been clear results. A Dutch legal expert said the move by the Netherlands means that the chances of a diplomatic solution must have been close to zero. “The Russians are not meeting their legal obligations, and the Dutch government is concluding that having a ruling by an international court is required as a next step,” said Marieke de Hoon, an assistant professor of international law at the V.U. Amsterdam University, who has been closely following legal proceedings in the MH17 case. “We are also seeing the Public Prosecution Office taking tough stances in the case at the district court in The Hague,” the one against the four defendants being tried in absentia, she said. “The Dutch are trying to get court rulings and they have a good chance of being successful.” The shooting down of the civilian airliner and Russia’s denials of any involvement have irritated many in the Netherlands, and support for the relatives of victims is high. “The Netherlands is now showing that they have full-out support,” for the families of victims, said Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, a Dutch lawmaker to whom Russia denied a visa after he led a successful effort to pass legislation creating human rights sanctions named after a Russian lawyer, the late Sergei Magnitski. Mr. Sjoerdsma said that because the Public Prosecution office of the Netherlands has already collected evidence for the case at the district court, it is now easier to supply the European court with the same evidence. “We should try to get justice in every court available,” he said. A group representing the families of victims said it was pleased with the Dutch decision to take Russia to court. They accuse Russia of stonewalling the investigation, despite what they say is clear evidence proving the country’s involvement. “We are extremely satisfied with this move; the Netherlands are continuing their clear and consistent approach against Russia,” said Piet Ploeg, the chairman of the MH17 Flight Disaster Foundation, representing family members of the crash victims. Mr. Ploeg lost his brother, his brother’s wife and their son in the downing of the Malaysia Airlines plane. “We hope this will bring an end to the disinformation campaign by the Russian state and end their opposition to the investigation,” he said. Claire Moses and Elian Peltier contributed reporting from London, and Anton Troianovski, Andrew Higgins and Andrew Kramer from Moscow.']","The Dutch government made the move to help individual cases brought by victims’ relatives, the foreign minister said in a letter to Parliament."
A Melania Trump Statue Is Set on Fire. Its Patron Gets Inspired.,2020-07-09,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — After a wooden statue of Melania Trump was burned near her birthplace in Slovenia over the weekend, the American artist who commissioned it said that he now wants to interview the arsonist as part of a new project. The life-size, rustic sculpture of Mrs. Trump, which was carved out of a linden tree last year by a local folk artist, showed the first lady waving a hand in the powder blue cashmere dress she wore at her husband’s inauguration in 2017. “There’s a lot of buzz around the destruction of monuments, so it could come from left-leaning people,” Brad Downey, the artist who commissioned the statue, said about the charred work near Sevnica, a rural town of 5,000 people where Mrs. Trump grew up. “Or it could be from right-leaning people, because they don’t like how it looks or think it’s disrespectful, aesthetically.” Mr. Downey had said that the statue was torched on July 4, but a spokesman for the police in Sevnica said that the blaze was started in the early hours of July 5. In an email, the spokesman, Robert Perc, added that investigations were continuing. Standing nine feet tall on the banks of the Sava, a major river in Slovenia, the sculpture drew mixed reactions when it was unveiled: with its rough-hewed features and naïve appearance, locals deemed it grotesque or said it looked like a scarecrow. But Mr. Downey said that people there generally liked the sculpture and had taken care of it — until last weekend. “The face is burned but the features are intact — we can still see the face,” said Mr. Downey, who has stored the sculpture in a temporary studio in Slovenia. He said that he planned to show the charred version at an exhibition in the country in September. “The blue dress is still all blue,” he noted. From the state of the remains, Mr. Downey said that whoever had set the statue afire had most likely put tires around the head and then dumped gasoline on it. A local police officer said the investigation was continuing and refused to comment further. A wooden statue representing President Trump in northeastern Slovenia was burned to the ground in January. The town of Sevnica has built a tourism industry around the Mrs. Trump’s origins ever since her husband entered the presidential race in 2015, with offerings such as Melania salami, Melania slippers and Melania wine. While the rural town has attracted tens of thousands of visitors, the first lady hasn’t visited Slovenia since then. Mr. Downey, a 39-year-old Berlin-based artist who defined his work as “contextual public art,” said that the sculpture was intended to question President Trump’s anti-immigration policy and what he described as a “heavy rhetoric of xenophobia.” He said he had commissioned a local sculptor, Ales Zupevc, known as Max, to create the statue because Mr. Zupevc was born in the same hospital the same month and year as Mrs. Trump: April 1970.

Protests Rock Russian Far East With Calls for Putin to Resign,2020-07-11,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Tens of thousands of people protested in Russia’s Far East on Saturday in a rare display of opposition to President Vladimir V. Putin in the country’s vast hinterland, chanting “Putin Resign” and demanding the release of a regional governor arrested this past week on suspicion of multiple murders. The protests in Khabarovsk, a city bordering China, and several other towns were the largest in Russia’s usually somnolent provinces in many years, rivaling or even exceeding in size demonstrations last summer in Moscow, the main center of opposition to the Kremlin. Unlike streets protests in Moscow, which the authorities can easily discredit as the work of a privileged metropolitan elite led astray by Russia’s enemies in the West, the outburst of anger against Mr. Putin in a hardscrabble region nearly 4,000 miles east of the capital presented an unusual and potentially more troublesome challenge. The demonstrations in towns across Khabarovsk Krai, a sprawling region that stretches from the frontier with China to the Arctic along the Pacific Ocean, followed the arrest on Thursday of the region’s popular governor, Sergei I. Furgal. He is one of Russia’s few provincial leaders not affiliated with political forces entirely controlled by the Kremlin. Mr. Furgal, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of the nationalist rabble-rouser Vladimir Zhirinovsky, took office in 2018 after defeating a Kremlin-endorsed candidate. Despite his affiliation with a party scorned by Russian liberals as a collection of crackpots and crooks, he has now been embraced by many Kremlin critics as a victim of political repression by Mr. Putin. Aleksei A. Navalny, a Moscow-based anti-corruption campaigner and Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, cheered Saturday’s protests in the Far East, hailing the street demonstration in Khabarovsk as the “biggest in the city’s history.” Mr. Nalvalny tweeted a video of the protests and a message of support: “Far East, We Are With You!” The Ministry of Interior, which controls Russia’s regular police forces, estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 people had joined the protest in Khabarovsk. Local news outlets put the number at more than 40,000. State-controlled media ignored the protests while giving extensive coverage to troubles in the United States, particularly a spike in coronavirus cases. The focus on America’s problems instead of Russia’s Far East led Dmitri Alekseyev, a wealthy businessman in Vladivostok, a city east of Khabarovsk, to comment on Facebook that “it seems I am living in the U.S.A.” City authorities in Khabarovsk, the regional capital, tried to prevent the rally by sealing off the main square, claiming that it needed to be disinfected. But municipal police officers stood aside as crowds poured peacefully into the center of the city. Videos showed festive scenes of protesters, both young and old, waving signs in support of the arrested governor and chanting “Freedom for Furgal,” “Moscow Get Out” and “Putin Step Down.” Protests were also reported in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, an important industrial center, Solnechny and other towns in Khabarovsk Krai. A former timber and scrap metal trader, Mr. Furgal has long been trailed by accusations of criminality. But protesters said they were less concerned about his innocence or guilt and more concerned that his alleged crimes, ignored for nearly two decades by investigators, had suddenly been used to depose a governor who, unlike Mr. Putin, had won a real and competitive election. Appearing in court in Moscow on Friday, Mr. Furgal pleaded not guilty to charges of multiple murders and attempted murder in the early 2000s. His arrest now, so many years later, was widely seen as politically motivated, the latest heavy-handed strike in a rolling crackdown unleashed after a rigged national plebiscite on constitutional amendments effectively entrenched Mr. Putin as president for life. After seven days of voting, the electoral commission in Moscow last week announced that Mr. Putin had won what the Kremlin described as a “triumphant referendum on confidence.” More than 78 percent of voters endorsed amendments that allow Mr. Putin to crash through term limits previously mandated by the Constitution and stay in power until at least 2036. He was supposed to step down at the end of his current term in 2024. But Mr. Putin’s image as a can-do leader has been badly battered by his often passive response to the coronavirus pandemic and a deepening economic crisis. His approval rating has slumped in recent weeks to its lowest level since taking office more than 20 years ago. While other countries in Europe or East Asia have slowed the pace of new infections, Russia is seeing nearly 7,000 new cases a day. And it risks new spikes following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in Moscow and most other places ahead of Mr. Putin’s constitutional plebiscite and a huge military parade in Red Square. Few commentators expect street protests to snowball nationwide and force Mr. Putin to step down, not least because the Kremlin controls an immense security apparatus adept at crushing demonstrations. But events in Khabarovsk and angry grumbling across the country over growing economic hardship suggest that Mr. Putin has lost his aura as an invincible leader supported by a large majority of the public. Mr. Putin has for years faced periodic outbursts of street protests involving mostly young people in Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia’s biggest and wealthiest cities. But aided by relentless propaganda on state-controlled television and loyal security officers, Mr. Putin has swatted his critics away, sneering at them as spoiled troublemakers out of step with ordinary Russians in the provinces who have repeatedly re-elected him by ever-increasing margins. But none of those presidential elections, which have excluded would-be opposition candidates like Mr. Navlny, has come close to being free and fair, leaving the Kremlin reliant on secret opinion polls to gauge Mr. Putin’s real level of support. Protests in places like Khabarovsk provide a rare unfiltered view of what many people, including those with no connection to Mr. Putin’s inveterate critics in Moscow, might really think.

An End to Empty Seats on Canada’s Airlines,2020-07-10,By Ian Austen,"['Photos of empty airports have come to symbolize the head-spinning drop in air travel during the pandemic. But the more surprising illustration for me involves a now-crowded space. The parking lots of rental car agencies near the Ottawa airport are now overstuffed with unwanted cars. So many of them have piled up since air travel has fallen by 90 percent in Canada that the unwanted rentals have overflowed into the vast parking lot of a nearby convention center. Recently, Canada’s two major airlines, Air Canada and WestJet, have been pushing to get more people back on their planes, urging politicians to substantially ease virus-related restrictions, including expanding border travel with the United States, as they move to restart additional routes later this month. “This is hundreds of times worse than 9/11, SARS, or the global financial crisis — quite frankly combined,” Calin Rovinescu, the chief executive of Air Canada, told the Financial Post in an interview. But at the same time that Mr. Rovinescu and his counterparts are working to get more people back in the air, they’ve made one change that gives some health officials pause. On Canada Day, both Air Canada and WestJet ended what the industry calls “seat blocking,” leaving a vacant seat between passengers. Though that gap was far short of the minimum recommended distance of 2 meters, it was still a gap. So while health officials are urging Canadians to keep their distance as various measures are eased, airlines are putting them in close contact in an enclosed space for flights that can last hours. During recent testimony before the House of Commons health committee, officials from all of Canada’s major airlines played down the need to keep passengers apart and emphasized what they called a cascading or multilayered approach to making sure infections don’t spread aboard flights. That approach, they repeatedly said, includes taking into account the quality of the air filtration systems on planes. In an email, Air Canada explained the end of seat blocking to me this way: “While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical.” It added: “It is very important that people understand how efficiently aircraft ventilation works to refresh air regularly onboard every 2 to 3 minutes, which is a key reason there has been no reports of disease outbreak clusters onboard flights.” But scientists, public health authorities and physicians seem less enthusiastic about a return to jampacked cabins and, for that matter, about moving large numbers of people around the country. “From a public health perspective the physical distancing is one of the key public health measures,” Dr. Howard Njoo, the deputy chief public health officer of Canada, said at a news conference when asked about the airlines’ new plan. “Physical distancing is our recommendation.” Dr. David N. Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, agreed that having multiple measures can lead to greater overall control of infections and he added that he’s been surprised by the lack of outbreaks clustered around flights. “That said, at the end of the day, proximity and crowding are important factors in facilitating disease transmission, so maintaining as much space as possible between individuals and requiring masks when space can’t be maintained seems quite common-sensical to me,” he said. “I can’t imagine that airplanes have some magical property that makes droplet borne transmission difficult if people are packed closely together.” Dr. Cory Neudorf a professor at the University of Saskatchewan’s medical school and the medical director for health surveillance at Saskatchewan Health Authority, told me in an email that viruses can still pass between passengers even with the most vigorous filtration. “Airplanes try to mitigate this through frequent air circulation and use of HEPA filters, but yes, you can still be infected if you breathe in the particles on their way to the filters,” he wrote in the email. He added that limiting the number of people aboard planes cuts the risk of transmission in other ways. “Fewer people in a given shared space means fewer people touching shared surfaces, so risk is reduced, especially if you don’t have someone using the same arm rest or other surfaces as they walk down aisles, use the washroom etc.,” he wrote. Air Canada will allow economy class passengers on flights that are nearly full to rebook at no cost. That, of course, assumes travel flexibility and the availability of flights with lots of empty seats. Moris Moreno recently produced a record for The Times of air travel from Seattle to Boston with his family, although the middle seats were empty when he took to the skies. [Read: Air Travel in the Age of Coronavirus: A Visual Diary of a Flight] I also asked Dr. Fisman about his personal travel plans: “I wouldn’t take a long haul flight if I could avoid it right now.” This week’s Trans Canada section was compiled by Catherine Porter Balarama Holness is a Montreal educator, broadcaster, law student, former professional Canadian football player, and one of the leaders of Canada’s current Black rights and anti-racism movement.

This one is over his family’s connections to the international WE Charity, which his government had awarded a no-bid contract to disburse hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to student volunteers. This week, it was revealed that Mr. Trudeau’s mother and brother were paid more than 280,000 Canadian dollars over four years by the charity for speaking at its events.

Hong Kong Police Raid Pollster on Eve of Pro-Democracy Camp Primary,2020-07-10,By Tiffany May and Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police raided the office of an independent polling institute on Friday, on the eve of a primary vote for the city’s pro-democracy camp, raising concerns of official interference in a campaign for the local legislature. The police action followed Beijing’s imposition of a sweeping security law in the city, which has heightened fears that Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, was at risk of losing many of its cherished freedoms and civil liberties. The polling organization, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, planned to work with the pro-democracy camp’s primary on Saturday and Sunday, a vote that is intended to help determine candidates for a Legislative Council election in September. The police said that officers belonging to the Cyber Security and Technology Crime unit searched an office in the Wong Chuk Hang neighborhood on Friday afternoon on the suspicion that computers at the institute had been hacked, leading to a leak of personal information. “The police received reports in recent days and suspect that the information of some residents, including police officers, is being leaked,” the police said in a statement. “It may be related to the relevant organization’s computer systems being attacked by unlawful means.” The statement added that no arrests were made in the operation. The institute’s directors said that police officers with a search warrant had entered offices around 6:30 p.m. and threatened to seize all of its electronic devices, including laptops containing polling data and the personal information of survey respondents, after receiving speculative reports of data breaches. “From my understanding, the police don’t rule out that we are deliberately disclosing some information in their investigations,” Robert Chung, the institute’s director told reporters. Dr. Chung said that the institute has been subject to sophisticated, state-level hacking attempts near election cycles since its voter records were digitized in 2012, and had proactively contacted law enforcement in previous years. But he said he worried whether the privacy of respondents and voters could be maintained under such police scrutiny. After a standoff that lasted past midnight, the officers agreed not to take away the devices, but to copy records they deemed suspicious. “No matter what, we would not allow them to take our computers,” said Chung Kim-wah, the institute’s deputy director, adding that the primary could not be held without them. “We fervently hope that the police will not copy data that touches upon personal information, though we cannot guarantee” he said, adding that pro bono lawyers would be on hand to observe the police copying the computer’s logs and files. An online user had boasted in chat groups last week that he had hacked into the institute’s records and obtained the personal data of police officers, records Chung Kim-wah said no longer existed in the institute’s computer systems. Au Nok-hin, a former pro-democracy lawmaker who was helping organize the primaries, said on Twitter that the raid was “very likely related to the primary vote, to create a threatening effect.” The institute’s practice is to store data, including the phone numbers of respondents, for half a year, as researchers analyze surveys. Hours before the raid, the independent polling institute released results to the question, “Is Hong Kong still a free city?” Among the respondents, 61 percent said that it no longer was, while 32 percent said that it was, according to results released Friday afternoon. The Hong Kong government has been sharply critical of the pro-democracy camp’s primary. Erick Tsang, the secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, told The Oriental Daily News, a pro-Beijing newspaper, in an interview published Thursday, that the authorities were investigating complaints that the primary might violate electoral law and the new national security law. The government has also warned district council members against using their offices to hold primary votes. Opposition district council candidates won a sweeping victory in November, a sign that the demands of a monthslong pro-democracy protest movement resonated with voters. The opposition camp has said it hopes to capture at least half the legislature’s 70 seats in September, but has acknowledged that its candidates could face widespread disqualifications before the vote. Benny Tai, a law professor who also helped organize the primary, wrote on Facebook that residents should resist intimidation efforts by voting. “One should not be intimidated or withdraw, but insist on living in reality,” wrote Mr. Tai, who was imprisoned over his role as a leader pro-democracy protests known as the Umbrella Movement in 2014. “As long as there are many people who persist in using their votes to reject lies, we can still see flickers of light in dark times and sustain the spirit of resistance,” he added.']","The investigation, which follows the imposition of a broad new national security law, raised fears of official interference in the voting."
Trudeau Faces Ethics Questions on Family Ties to Charity Given Government Contract,2020-07-10,By Catherine Porter and Dan Bilefsky,"['TORONTO — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s mother and brother were paid more than $200,000 over four years by a charity recently awarded a no-bid contract to disburse hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to student volunteers, officials confirmed Thursday. The revelation raised ethical questions anew for Mr. Trudeau, who has faced earlier conflict-of-interest complaints along with a high-profile ethics investigation that had once threatened to derail his tenure. Last week, the country’s ethics commissioner opened an investigation into whether the prime minister had breached conflict-of-interest rules by awarding the aid contract to an organization, known as the WE Charity, with which he has close personal ties. Facing an uproar, the government reconsidered and said it would run the aid program instead, known as the Canada Student Service Grant. But questions were revived on Thursday when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the news site Canadaland reported that the charity had paid Mr. Trudeau’s mother and brother a total of $207,000, about 282,000 Canadian dollars, for speaking engagements. The charity confirmed the information to The New York Times. “The prime minister personally intervened to direct a billion-dollar program to a group that had paid his family almost $300k. Not in Venezuela. Not in Zimbabwe. In Canada,” tweeted Pierre Poilievre, a member of Parliament from the opposition Conservatives, demanding an emergency session to address the issue. The episode threatens to tarnish Mr. Trudeau, who has only recently started to rebuild his image. His party narrowly won re-election last year after he was accused in an ethics investigation of trying to improperly influence a high-profile corporate criminal case. In a statement, Mr. Trudeau’s office said the “prime minister’s relatives engage with a variety of organizations and support many personal causes on their own accord.” It urged Canadians to focus on the aid program, not on its administration. “The Canada Student Service Grant program is about giving young people opportunities to contribute to their communities, not about benefits to anyone else,” Alex Wellstead, the prime minister’s press secretary, said in an email. Mr. Trudeau has spoken at WE Charity events. His wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, has hosted a podcast connected to the charity about mental health, called WE Well-Being. The charity’s press office said in an email that the prime minister and his wife had volunteered their time and were not paid, with one exception in 2012, when Ms. Gregoire Trudeau received about $1,000 for a speaking engagement. Mr. Trudeau was not prime minister at the time. The award of the student aid contract to WE Charity, an organization best known for hosting large youth events, had already stirred criticism, not only from opposition parties but also from some Canadians in the nonprofit sector. In response, the government announced last week that it would instead administer the aid program, established to cushion some student costs during a weakened economy by awarding them with up to $5,000 in grants for doing volunteer work. In addition, the charity’s founding brothers, Craig and Marc Kielburger, said the organization would waive all the administrative costs incurred in setting up the program and would return government funds already received to the government. The charity had been slated to receive a total of $14 million for overseeing the program. The latest revelations played to an image of a prime minister who already suffered from “the whiff of entitlement,” said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian nonprofit polling firm based in Vancouver. “The question is whether this will further stick to the bottom of his shoe,” Ms. Kurl said. In August of last year, Canada’s federal ethics commissioner found that Mr. Trudeau had violated an ethics law when he used his office “to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit” the former justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould. The commissioner said Mr. Trudeau had improperly pressured her to seek a civil penalty against SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based engineering company, rather than a criminal conviction. But while the scandal haunted him, Mr. Trudeau nevertheless went on to win a second term late last year, albeit with a minority government. And in December 2017, Canada’s conflict-of-interest and ethics commissioner ruled that a vacation by the Trudeau family on a private Caribbean island owned by a billionaire philanthropist — and two other trips made by him or members of his family — broke four sections of Canada’s conflict-of-interest law. Those episodes took the sheen off Mr. Trudeau, who first came to power in 2015, fashioning himself as a liberal change-maker with a strong moral compass. Since last year’s hard-fought re-election campaign, Mr. Trudeau has worked hard to rebuild his brand and, in recent months, it has been burnished by his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He managed the crisis for some time from his home study, with three children underfoot and his wife suffering from the virus in bed. Catherine Porter reported from Toronto, and Dan Bilesky from Montreal.']",Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s brother and mother were both paid by a charity handpicked by his government to oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to students.
"In Tackling Coronavirus, Scotland Asserts Its Separateness From England",2020-07-10,By Mark Landler,"['EDINBURGH, Scotland — There was nothing particularly festive about Nicola Sturgeon’s recent visit to the Cold Town House, a newly reopened Edinburgh pub, but maybe that was the point. Sipping coffee and surveying plexiglass dividers, Ms. Sturgeon, the leader of Scotland’s government, warned customers not to expect the jolly, sweaty intimacy of nightlife before the coronavirus pandemic. “No beer garden or cafe should feel the same as it did before,” she said as a drenching rain fell, obscuring the stony ramparts of Edinburgh Castle that tower above this once-teeming establishment. As Scotland emerges from a three-month lockdown, it is moving more carefully than neighboring England, a divergence that owes a lot to Ms. Sturgeon’s cautious style and her conviction that England, under its more freewheeling leader, Boris Johnson, is taking too many risks in a headlong rush to resume public life. For now, Scotland’s approach has made it a bright spot in coronavirus-ravaged Britain. New cases have dwindled to a handful a day, and deaths to a trickle. If Scotland maintains this progress — a big if, given its open border — it could stamp out the epidemic by the fall, public health experts say. Such a goal seems fanciful in England, which is still reporting hundreds of new cases and dozens of deaths every day. But what happens in England inevitably spills over into Scotland. In the case of the virus, the stark contrast in daily numbers has reanimated old grievances for the Scots, who voted against leaving the United Kingdom in 2014 but overwhelmingly rejected Britain’s vote to leave the European Union two years later. Nationalist sentiment has surged during the pandemic: Fifty-five percent of Scots now favor independence, according to a recent poll — a solid majority that analysts said reflected a perception that Scotland’s nationalist-led government has handled the crisis better than Mr. Johnson and his pro-Brexit ministers have. Scotland imposed its lockdown on March 23, the same day as England did, but has lifted the restrictions more selectively. It kept pubs closed a few days longer. It requires people to wear face masks in shops, which England does not. And unlike England, it left Spain, a popular holiday destination, off a list of countries to which Scots can travel without isolating themselves when they return. “We’re quite stubborn and steadfast because Nicola has handled it elegantly and we’ve seen how England is flapping around,” said Katy Koren, the artistic director of Gilded Balloon, a company that stages live performances during the Edinburgh Festival, which has been canceled this summer. So far, she said, Scots have given Ms. Sturgeon, 49, the benefit of the doubt because she has been willing to make tough decisions and has convinced people that her overriding goal is the public health. Her no-nonsense briefings have become a reassuring daily ritual, even providing grist for comedians. Ms. Sturgeon’s fans liken her to New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who has come closer than perhaps any other leader to stamping out the virus. The unspoken contrast is to Mr. Johnson, who has been all over the map in his response and has often seemed reluctant to deliver bad news. “Men like to be popular,” said Ms. Koren’s mother, Karen, who runs the festival company with her daughter. “For women, it’s not about ego.” But it is, inescapably, about politics. Ms. Sturgeon’s Scottish National Party is committed to independence and a return to the European Union. As she has diverged from the British government — a process that broke into the open in late May when she stuck with the slogan “Stay Home” and rejected Mr. Johnson’s more permissive “Stay Alert” — she is building a powerful new case for Scotland’s ability to go it alone. Under the terms of limited self-government in the United Kingdom, the Scottish authorities are responsible for matters like health and education, while the British government handles immigration, foreign policy and, crucially, the fiscal rescue packages to protect those who lost their jobs in the lockdown. That has enabled Ms. Sturgeon to slow-walk Mr. Johnson’s steps to ease the lockdown, which she complains are often foisted on her without advance notice. She clucked over pictures of revelers jamming the streets of Soho in London after he opened pubs — a spectacle that she avoided by scheduling Scotland’s reopening for a Monday rather than a Saturday. To some, particularly those who do not share her nationalist politics or are eager to get their businesses running again, there is more than a whiff of point-scoring. “She is a fantastic politician,” said Nic Wood, the owner of the Cold Town House, who invited her to visit his pub. “But a lot of what she now does is all about getting independence. Her talents would be better used if she could just lead the country.” Hotel and restaurant owners were alarmed when Ms. Sturgeon declined to rule out a quarantine for visitors from England after Mr. Johnson lifted a 14-day quarantine for people traveling to and from 59 countries. She expressed concern that visitors could carry the virus into Scotland from third countries. “We can’t afford any inference that the English aren’t welcome in Scotland,” said Marc Crothall, the chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, who noted that 70 percent of Scotland’s tourism revenue comes from visitors within the United Kingdom. Ms. Sturgeon’s threat also provoked Mr. Johnson, who typically says the differences between Scotland and England are overblown. He described it as “astonishing” and claimed, “There is no such thing as a border between England and Scotland.” Over the last three months, Ms. Sturgeon, who declined a request for an interview for this article, has developed strong ideas about how to combat the pandemic. She convened a group of scientific advisers separate from the British government’s panel, and they consulted a German health official for best practices. Scotland honed its test-and-protect program, which is less dependent on private contractors than the system in England and recruits its contact tracers from communities — all of which, officials say, make it more effective. “We’ve been really pleased to see the case numbers fall the way they have,” said Dr. Janet Stevenson, who coordinates the program for the Edinburgh region, though she acknowledged that it will be harder to control cases as more outsiders start flowing into Scotland from England. “It’s a leaky old border,” she said. Devi Sridhar, who runs the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh, noted that the two countries took radically different approaches from the start: England’s priority was to prevent its hospitals from being overrun, while Scotland’s was to drive cases down to zero. If not for imported cases from the south, Dr. Sridhar said, Scotland could come close to that goal by the end of the summer. “If we were an island, we could eliminate it entirely,” she said. “That’s why cooperation is needed in global health.” Other experts say elimination is a quixotic target under any circumstances. To achieve it, Scotland would have to keep in place measures that are economically untenable and would cause other health-related problems. Even New Zealand has been struck with new cases — imported from England, as it happens. Some also question whether Scotland’s performance is all that remarkable compared with Europe as a whole. Its reported death rate of 46 per 100,000 is far lower than the 71 per 100,000 in England. But it is on a par with France and higher than Northern Ireland. England has 56 million people, compared with Scotland’s 5.4 million. It is sparsely populated, without a metropolis like London, where the outbreak exploded in early March. Fortunate timing may have spared it the worst. “Scotland was six or seven days behind London,” said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. “That is a very long time, if the epidemic is doubling every three or four days.” Scotland’s experience, he added, was not “particularly better or worse than other European countries.” For many in Scotland, however, what matters is not how their country fared relative to the rest of the world, but how it stacks up to England. Ms. Sturgeon’s approval ratings have risen to above 80 percent, while Mr. Johnson’s ratings have declined. That could embolden her to press him to allow another independence referendum — something he has so far ruled out. “They might still say no,” said Nicola McEwen, a professor of politics at the University of Edinburgh. “But it will be more difficult. She is emerging from this, at least so far, with more authority and more respect.” At the Cold Town House, where a handful of customers sipped pints on a chilly day earlier this week, there was a stoic pride in Scotland’s disciplined response to the pandemic. The cobbled streets of Edinburgh’s Royal Mile, which usually throb with festival goers at this time of the year, were nearly deserted. From the castle’s ghostly ramparts, residents contemplated their becalmed city. “There’s a conservatism in Scotland, where doing the sensible, rational stuff outweighs the more emotional response to things,” said Tom Harries, an entrepreneur who is originally from Bristol, England, and runs a start-up that has helped businesses find ways to survive during the lockdown. There is also, he said, one-upmanship. “As an Englishman, I myself am thinking, ‘What a mess,’” he said. “How does this reflect on England? It feels a bit shameful.”']","The measured response by Scotland’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, is a marked contrast to the freewheeling approach of Prime Minister Boris Johnson — and appears to be working."
Ethiopia Announces Arrests in Prominent Singer’s Killing,2020-07-11,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Ethiopia has said that two men have been arrested in connection with the killing of Hachalu Hundessa, a well-known musician and activist whose death last month was followed by unrest in which hundreds were killed. Attorney General Adanech Abebe announced the arrests in a televised statement on Friday night, saying that a third suspect in Mr. Hundessa’s shooting was still on the run. “We will continue to uphold the rule of law,” Ms. Abebe said. She said the two men arrested had confessed to killing Mr. Hundessa, acting on the orders of an armed splinter wing of the Oromo Liberation Front, an opposition group, with the goal of inciting ethnic tension and overthrowing the government. She provided no evidence for the claim, and the Oromo Liberation Front had yet to respond to the accusation as of Saturday morning. Mr. Hundessa, 34, was shot on June 29 in a suburb of the capital, Addis Ababa. He was taken to a hospital but died of his wounds. The singer and activist was a member of Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, who have long been marginalized despite their numbers. His songs of resistance made him a hero to a generation of young people struggling for political and economic change. After his death, violent protests broke out in Addis Ababa and the neighboring Oromia region. Officials said that at least 239 people had been killed in the unrest, during which buildings were burned and groups of young men carried out ethnically motivated attacks. The government blocked the internet and arrested nearly 5,000 people, including activists, journalists and a prominent critic of the government, Jawar Mohammed. Tensions also escalated when the police blocked mourners from attending Mr. Hundessa’s funeral in his hometown, Ambo, 60 miles west of the capital. The violence has posed a challenge to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is overseeing Ethiopia’s delicate transition from authoritarian rule to multiparty democracy. Mr. Hundessa’s music provided a soundtrack to a wave of antigovernment protests that began in 2015, which eventually led to the resignation of the prime minister at the time, Hailemariam Desalegn, and the rise of Mr. Abiy, an Oromo himself. Since taking office in 2018, Mr. Abiy has introduced widespread political, economic and social overhauls, including amnesty for political prisoners and the legalization of banned opposition groups. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for such measures, and for restarting peace talks with neighboring Eritrea. But the changes brought about by Mr. Abiy have also lifted the lid on serious challenges to his government. He has faced criticism from members of the Oromo community who say he has not done enough to alleviate their problems. Mr. Abiy recently said that those who had killed Mr. Hundessa wanted to cause civil unrest and derail progress in Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous nation, after Nigeria. In a statement after the attorney general’s announcement, Mr. Abiy’s office asked members of the public for help in tracking down the third suspect and said that the government was committed to the overhauls.  “The government recognizes that this journey is tumultuous and filled with many obstacles, as structures, systems and networks that remained under the grip of authoritarianism are slowly being chiseled away,” the statement read, adding that, “political will at the highest level is anchored in establishing a just and democratic order that pays heed to equality and respect of fundamental rights and dignity of every citizen.” Leaders and officials around the world have called on Ethiopia to refrain from using disproportionate force in dealing with the recent protests. The United Nations Human Rights Office said it was “deeply concerned” about the violence, while the African Union chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat, appealed for restraint from all sides. Last week, hundreds of Oromo residents of Minnesota gathered in St. Paul to condemn Mr. Hundessa’s killing. Representative Ilhan Omar said on Twitter that she would “do everything in my power to ensure that the United States helps pursue justice for the killing of Hachalu Hundessa.”']","The shooting last month of Hachalu Hundessa, a hero to young Ethiopians calling for reform, was followed by unrest in which hundreds of people were killed."
Louisiana Orders Bars Closed and Masks for Most,2020-07-11,,"['This briefing has ended. Follow the latest news on the coronavirus outbreak. President Trump on Saturday wore a mask in public for the first time, after repeated urging from aides that it was a necessary message to send to Americans resistant to covering their faces. Mr. Trump wore a dark mask affixed with the presidential seal during a visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he planned to visit wounded troops. He was surrounded by Secret Service agents and others also wearing masks. Anticipation over whether he would wear a mask had been building, after the president had repeatedly dismissed suggestions that he wear a mask, frequently appearing in public spaces without one, mocking those who did and ignoring public health rules in several states. But as the pandemic has spread to states with large numbers of Republican voters, Mr. Trump had signaled more recently that he was more open to masks, and told reporters he planned to wear a mask on the visit to the medical center. Before going there, he stopped to speak with reporters at the White House. “I’ll probably have a mask, if you must know,” Mr. Trump said. “I think when you’re in a hospital, especially in that particular setting where you’re talking to a lot of soldiers and people that in some cases just got off the operating tables. I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask. I’ve never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place.” Weeks ago, the president took a mask off before seeing reporters during a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan, in violation of factory policy, which he said he did to avoid being photographed with it on. Last month he refused to wear a mask at a factory in Maine that produced coronavirus testing swabs, forcing the manufacturer to dump products made during a demonstration for the president. And in May, he did not wear a mask during a visit to a Honeywell mask factory in Phoenix, Ariz., despite signage in the building asking visitors and workers to do so at all times. Masks were scarce at recent Trump campaign events in Oklahoma, Arizona and South Dakota. In contrast to Mr. Trump’s reluctance, a growing number of governors, both Republican and Democratic, and even Vice President Mike Pence have taken up the cause in recent weeks. Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona and Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia are among the chorus of Republican officials who have encouraged their constituents to actively cover their faces in public. In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards on Saturday said almost all residents must wear a mask in public. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, recently issued a similar order. Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mitt Romney of Utah have also called on the president to wear face coverings, at least as a symbolic gesture. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also implored the president to wear one. In an interview this month, Mr. Trump said he “would wear one if I were in a group of people and I was close,” adding that he “sort of liked” the way he looked. “It was a dark black mask,” he said at the time, “and I thought it looked OK. I looked like the Lone Ranger.” As the national death toll mounts and the coronavirus continues its surge across the Sun Belt, the governor of Louisiana on Saturday ordered bars to close and most residents to wear a mask outside. The state had an early outbreak that then receded, before a recent spike in cases and hospitalizations. South Carolina announced its highest single-day total for coronavirus cases on Saturday, recording more than 2,200 infections; its previous record was set on July 4 with 1,854 new cases. More than 22 percent of tests in the state came back positive on Friday — the highest positivity rate for the state yet, according to health officials. North Carolina, Oregon, Arkansas, Hawaii and Alaska also recorded single-day highs Saturday. More than 60,000 new coronavirus cases were announced in the U.S. on Saturday, more than any day of the pandemic except Friday, when the country recorded more than 68,000 — setting a single-day record for the seventh time in 11 days. The country’s seven-day death average reached 642 on Friday, up from 471 on July 5, but still a fraction of the more than 2,200 deaths the country averaged each day in mid-April, when the outbreak in the Northeast was at its worst. And eight states set single-day death records this week: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Tennessee. South Carolina and Florida were among the first states to reopen and are now among the worst-hit states. Florida hit daily records twice in the last 10 days, and has surpassed 10,000 daily cases five times in that period, announcing 10,360 new infections on Saturday. In South Carolina, National Guard troops were expected to be called in to help hospitals in the state handle the increased strain on the health care system. The Department of Health and Environmental Control reported the first death of a child in the state, according to a news release. The child was younger than 5 and from the Midlands region of the state, according to the release, which did not otherwise identify the child. South Carolina has had more than 54,000 coronavirus cases and more than 950 deaths as of Saturday, according to a New York Times database. Gov. Henry McMaster announced that the sale of alcohol in all bars and restaurants would be prohibited after 11 p.m., beginning Saturday night. Mr. McMaster said he hoped the move would help reduce transmission among young adults. More than 20 percent of the state’s confirmed cases are in people ages 21 to 30, health officials said. Florida and Texas closed bars again last month, and bars across Las Vegas and Reno shut down for the second time at midnight on Friday. Public health experts have said the virus has spread quickly through bars because people linger, drink and often have to shout or get closer to hear each other over blaring music. Louisiana has more cases per capita than all but New York and New Jersey, and on Friday, the state recorded more than 2,600 positive tests, more than any day since April 2. “It’s become clear to me, especially after the numbers that we saw yesterday, that our current restrictions are not enough,” Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, said at a news conference announcing the order. He said that more than 10 percent of the people who were being tested were testing positive. The governor said that Louisianians over the age of 8 must wear a mask when they are not able to socially distance from other people, unless they have a health condition. Local parishes can opt out, but only if they hit certain requirements, Mr. Edwards said, noting that only three were in that position on Saturday. Several states and cities are rolling back their reopenings or even contemplating locking down again. In Texas, which reported record numbers of daily cases four times this week, Gov. Abbott signaled Friday the possibility of a new economic “lockdown” if the state cannot curtail its outbreak. In Georgia, Atlanta officials said Friday they were preparing to shift back to “Phase 1” guidelines, which call for residents to largely stay at home. Most of Georgia’s cases have been concentrated in the counties making up the Atlanta metropolitan area. In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said this week that emergency public health restrictions would be reinstated on Monday, including prohibitions on indoor dining and barring out-of-state visitors to New Mexico’s state parks.  More than 10,000 Israelis whose livelihoods have imploded because of the coronavirus erupted in rage over the government’s economic policies at a protest Saturday night that filled Rabin Square in downtown Tel Aviv. Actors, nightclub owners, hotel and domestic workers and people from countless other walks of life demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “get the money flowing,” likening their struggle to a war, but one for bread — a staple that is Israeli shorthand for economic anxieties. Masks were in abundance but distance between protesters was not. The police said they had authorized 1,800 people to attend the demonstration but the crowd overflowed the two-city-block plaza in front of City Hall. Mr. Netanyahu, whose management of the pandemic was already under assault — the infection is spreading in Israel faster than ever — had tried hard to defuse the protest in meetings on Friday, the Israeli news media reported. But its organizers refused to call it off. The unemployment rate is 21 percent, with more than 850,000 Israelis jobless. But differences in the way different categories of workers are protected are leaving the self-employed, small-business owners and unsalaried workers with far less of a safety net than those whose companies put them on unpaid leave. Mr. Netanyahu announced Thursday that the self-employed would receive more than $2,100 by next week, but protesters said earlier rounds of subsidies were too little and had arrived too late. “Enough with the lies!” read one sign. “We need the money now, not tomorrow,” said Avinoam Nehamad, who owns a tourism company, according to Walla News. In Serbia, thousands of protesters also demonstrated outside Parliament for the fourth consecutive night on Friday, ignoring a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. The rallies — set off by an announcement of since-aborted plans to reinstate a total lockdown in Belgrade, the capital — quickly evolved into protests over democratic backsliding in recent years under President Aleksandar Vucic, his approach to Kosovo, and the inconsistent and politicized ways in which his government has imposed social restrictions during the pandemic. At least 60 people on two Marine bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa have been infected with the coronavirus, according to Marine officials. A spokesman for the Marines said that commanders had enacted “soft shelter-in-place orders” at the bases, Camp Hansen and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, and that only essential personnel would be permitted to enter and leave those areas as the authorities sought to curb the spread of the virus. “Cleaning teams have been dispatched and thorough contact tracing is ongoing to identify and isolate those who may have come in contact with infected personnel,” a spokesman for the Marines, Major Kenneth Kunze, said in a statement on Saturday. A Marine familiar with the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that it was likely that the virus was transmitted to at least one of the bases after a unit recently deployed there in mid-June, part of the Marine Corps unit program that regularly sends troops to Okinawa to train and deploy throughout the region. It is believed that some of those deployed in the unit contracted the virus after sneaking off the base for July 4 celebrations, according to the Marine as well as a notice sent by a Marine official. “Okinawans are shocked by what we were told” by the U.S. military about the outbreak, the Okinawa governor, Denny Tamaki, told a news conference, according to The Associated Press. He questioned disease prevention measures taken by the U.S. military. GLOBAL ROUNDUP On a day when India reported more than 28,000 new coronavirus infections, one case in particular caught the whole country’s attention: Amitabh Bachchan, a Bollywood star and one of India’s most revered figures. Mr. Bachchan, known as Big B, announced on Saturday to his 43 million followers on Twitter that he had tested positive and urged his recent contacts to get tested themselves. His son, Abhishek, also an actor, disclosed that he was positive as well. Both appear to have only mild symptoms. India is now racking up more new reported infections each day than any other country except the United States and Brazil. It also has the third-highest total number of infections after those same two countries, with about 850,000 confirmed cases and more than 22,000 deaths. Hospitals in India are overflowing to the point that pregnant women have died in labor after being turned away. The surge in cases has led officials around India to reimpose restrictions after attempting to loosen things up to stimulate a critically wounded economy. The borders between states are being rigorously patrolled, and international travel is still closed. But the density of India’s population makes it difficult to practice social distancing in cities like Mumbai, home to Mr. Bachchan. It’s hard to overstate how big Big B really is, having appeared in more than 200 films over the past 50 years. “He’s like god,” said Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, a filmmaker who has worked with him. “I’ve never seen a star having such power, such credibility. He’s the biggest superstar this country has ever, ever seen.” Mr. Bachchan’s illness might create more fear across India. But Mr. Dungarpur predicted that many Indians would find his struggle inspiring and say to themselves: “If Amitabh Bachchan can fight this, so can we.” Other developments around the world: Australian citizens and residents traveling from overseas to New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, will be charged for their mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine starting July 18, the state premier said on Sunday. Everyone whose airline ticket was purchased after July 12 will have to pay 3,000 Australian dollars, or about $2,100, for the first adult, 1,000 dollars for each additional adult, and 500 dollars for each child 3 or older. Mandatory hotel quarantines at a similar cost to international arrivals are already in effect in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and other parts of the country are likely to begin charging travelers as well amid a new outbreak in Melbourne, Australia’s second-biggest city. On Friday, Australia said it would halve the number of people permitted to return each week to 4,000 from about 8,000. The border has been closed to nonresidents since March. Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing who has criticized the Chinese government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, was released from detention on Sunday, a week after the police took him away. In Hong Kong, a Department of Health spokeswoman said on Saturday that the latest outbreak in the semiautonomous Chinese territory was worse than an earlier peak in March because of a growing number of cases with unknown origins and growing clusters linked to housing estates, homes for older people and restaurants. Hong Kong recorded 28 new infections and 33 preliminary positive cases on Saturday, after a spike this week. In France, the widow of a bus driver who was beaten to death after he asked four passengers to wear masks is demanding “exemplary punishment” for his attackers, The Associated Press reported on Saturday. Four people are in custody in relation to the July 5 attack on the driver, Philippe Monguillot, at a bus stop in the city of Bayonne. Mr. Monguillot had been hospitalized in critical condition, and his death was announced on Friday. His wife, Veronique Monguillot, said in a meeting with the French interior minister that she and their three daughters had been “destroyed” by the attack. “We must bang a fist on the table, so this never happens again,” she said.  Thousands of theme park fans turned out — in masks in the scorching Florida heat and amid a virus surge — for the reopening of Walt Disney World, a place designed to chase your troubles away. After closing in March because of the pandemic, the mega-resort near Orlando began tossing confetti again at 9 a.m. Two of its four major parks, the Magic Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom, welcomed back a limited number of temperature-checked visitors, with some attractions and character interactions unavailable as safety precautions. Epcot and Disney’s Hollywood Studios were set to reopen on Wednesday. It amounted to a breathtaking effort by a corporation to prove that it can safely operate — entertaining families and employing tens of thousands of workers — at a highly dangerous time. Other amusement parks are also opening. Dorney Park in Pennsylvania and Cedar Point in Ohio also announced they would open to all guests on Saturday, after exclusively allowing season pass holders for several days. SeaWorld Orlando also resumed operating its rides and marine exhibits on Saturday. The reality of whether Disney succeeds in keeping its guests and employees safe will become clear in the weeks to come. Demand is also a question, especially since Disney World draws much of its attendance from the Northeast. Earlier in the week, negative commentary about the reopening flooded Twitter. People used words like “irresponsible” and “disappointed” to describe Disney’s decision to stick to its reopening plans, announced in May, even as coronavirus cases surged. There are 49 state governments that report the home county of people who die from the coronavirus. And then there is Kansas, which refuses to do so. There are 49 state governments that update their coronavirus case totals at least five times a week. And then there is Kansas, which forgoes updates on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends. As Kansas’ case numbers surge to record levels — more than 4,000 infections have been announced already this month, including spikes around Wichita, Lawrence and the Kansas City suburbs — the state sticks out for its opacity. Since early in the pandemic, Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration has refused to release the names of meatpacking plants tied to thousands of cases, citing privacy concerns. In neighboring Colorado and Missouri, state officials have provided detailed accounts of similar outbreaks. Officials at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment use the same reason — patient privacy — for refusing to say which of the state’s 105 counties are reporting coronavirus deaths. All other states have long provided county-level death details. In Kansas, it is up to local officials to decide whether to release that information. The state government has stuck by its policies even as outbreaks have emerged at Kansas bars, churches and colleges, and as officials in several counties have overturned Ms. Kelly’s order requiring masks. Until mid-May, Kansas updated its public data every day, like almost every other state. But for nearly two months, state-level updates have come only three times a week. That has left Kansans with less frequent information at the same time that Republicans in the state have tried to curb the emergency authority of Ms. Kelly, a Democrat, and as officials in many counties have disregarded her reopening plan. Kristi Zears, a state health department spokeswoman, said the decision to cut back on public updates allowed officials to focus on other aspects of the coronavirus response, and that it had not slowed the pace of case investigations. “With the increasing number of outbreaks and increasing requests from local health departments to assist with case investigations and contact tracing, we shifted more focus on assisting counties,” Ms. Zears said in an email. As school districts across the United States consider whether and how to restart in-person classes, they face two fundamental uncertainties: No nation has tried to send children back to school with the virus raging at levels like America’s, and the scientific research about transmission in classrooms is limited. The World Health Organization has concluded that the virus is airborne in crowded, indoor spaces with poor ventilation, a description that fits many American schools, and many of the country’s 3.5 million teachers are feeling under siege, under pressure from the White House, pediatricians and some parents to resume normal teaching. “I’m just going to say it: It feels like we’re playing Russian roulette with our kids and our staff,” said Robin Cogan, a nurse at the Yorkship School in Camden, N.J., who serves on the state’s committee on reopening schools. Three science reporters for The Times, Pam Belluck, Apoorva Mandavilli and Benedict Carey, reviewed relevant studies from around the world. The data, they write, clearly shows that children are far less likely than adults to become seriously ill from the virus. And some research suggests younger children are less likely than teenagers to infect others, though the evidence is not conclusive. Countries like Norway and Denmark reopened schools after reducing infection levels, and have not seen a surge in cases. They initially opened only for younger children, strengthened sanitizing procedures, and have kept class size limited, children in small groups at recess and space between desks. The larger concern is that children could become infected, many with no symptoms, and then spread the virus to others, including family members, teachers and other school employees. In Israel, the virus infected more than 200 students and staff after schools reopened in early May and lifted limits on class size a few weeks later, according to a report by University of Washington researchers. On the other hand, a study in Ireland of six infected people — two high school students, an elementary student and three adults — who spent time in schools before they closed in March found that the only documented transmission involved one of the adults, and outside of school. When California shut down its economy in March, it became a model for painful but aggressive action to counter the virus. The implicit trade-off was that a lot of upfront pain would help slow the spread, allowing the state to reopen sooner and more triumphantly than places that failed to act as decisively. But the virus had other plans. California is now averaging about 8,000 new cases a day, and the state’s economy is in retrenchment mode again. Unemployment, which was 3.9 percent in February, the lowest on record, shot up to 16.3 percent by May, compared with 13.3 percent nationwide. Container traffic at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is down about a third from a year ago, while many beaches and attractions like Disneyland were closed on July Fourth and are delaying their reopening plans. Most dispiriting is the sense that even after politicians made tough calls that Californians largely supported, the economy seems no better off. Andrew Snow, who owns the Golden Squirrel, a restaurant and bar in Oakland’s Rockridge neighborhood, cut his staff of 28 people to two after the pandemic hit. But thanks to takeout orders, a new line of business selling groceries and the resumption of outdoor service, he recently brought two back, and was set to bump that figure to six or eight by the July Fourth weekend. But business is slowing again, as California is averaging about 8,000 new cases a day, about triple the level a month ago. Mr. Snow’s plans to bring back workers over the holiday weekend didn’t come to pass, and he has put further hiring on hold. “People are scared,” he said. “The math for having more people doesn’t work out anymore.” A Scottish pilot in Vietnam who spent more than two months on life support after contracting Covid-19 and became the subject of nationwide public interest was released from the hospital on Saturday and headed to the airport for his return home. The case of the pilot, Stephen Cameron, 43, has come to exemplify Vietnam’s all-out effort to beat the coronavirus, with the state news media in the Communist country covering his treatment extensively. Mr. Cameron was so seriously ill at one point that doctors contemplated a double lung transplant. “I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the Vietnamese people, the dedication and professionalism of the doctors,” Mr. Cameron said before his departure, in a video released by Cho Ray Hospital, where he was treated. “The odds say that I shouldn’t be here, and so I can only thank everybody here for doing what they have done.” Vietnam has been among the most successful countries in tackling the virus. It is the largest country not to have reported a single Covid-19 death. No cases of local transmission have been reported since mid-April. And just 369 cases in total have been confirmed in the country of more than 97 million people. Known as Patient 91, Mr. Cameron arrived in Ho Chi Minh City in February to take a job with Vietnam Airlines. He tested positive for the virus in March after visiting a bar that emerged as the center of Vietnam’s biggest coronavirus cluster. Doctors at Cho Ray Hospital, in Ho Chi Minh City, said he was now free of the virus. But he faces a long recovery period after spending two months in a medically induced coma. A Facebook video posted by the hospital on July 3 showed him lying in bed surrounded by doctors and other workers, who applauded his progress as he answered simple questions and tested the strength in his legs. The German soccer club Union Berlin wants its fans back, and soon. And to do so, it plans to offer free coronavirus tests to more than 20,000 fans so they can fill up its stadium’s seats when the next season starts in September. From setting up contact tracing to allowing a limited amount of fans in stands, clubs across Europe have studied various alternatives to let people watch their teams play in stadiums. If carried out, Union Berlin’s plan would be a first. The club said ticket holders would have to test negative for the coronavirus within 24 hours of the game and bring the test’s result along with their ticket. When most European countries were in the early stages of the pandemic, some soccer games in late February and early March contributed to the spread of the virus, before leagues suspended their seasons — or canceled them altogether. With games now played behind closed doors, stadiums have been depleted of those who once made them roar and bristle with life. And for many, the financial loss caused by the absence of tickets sales is critical. Most of the 22,000 seats in Union Berlin’s stadium are terraces on which fans stand close together, so social distancing is not feasible, the club’s president, Dirk Zingler, said in a statement announcing the free coronavirus tests. “And if we aren’t allowed to sing and shout, then it’s not Union,” he said. Beyond the logistics and cost of providing over 20,000 tests several times a month, the club may run into other obstacles: Large gatherings are banned in Berlin until Oct. 24, and even with tests, crowds could prove risky. In Switzerland, FC Zurich had to postpone two games after it said on Saturday that several members of its staff and at least one player had tested positive for the coronavirus, in what may await other teams as they finish the current season. On an afternoon in early April, while New York City was in the throes of what would be the deadliest days of the pandemic, Dr. Lorna M. Breen found herself alone in the still of her apartment in Manhattan. She picked up her phone and dialed her younger sister, Jennifer Feist, as she did nearly every day. Lately, their conversations had been bleak. Dr. Breen, 49, supervised the emergency department at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital in Upper Manhattan. The unit had become a brutal battleground, with supplies depleting at a distressing rate and doctors — herself among them — and nurses falling ill. The waiting room was perpetually overcrowded. The sick were dying unnoticed. When Dr. Breen called this time, she sounded odd. Her voice was distant, as if she was in shock. “I don’t know what to do,” she said. “I can’t get out of the chair.” Her sister helped to get her into a psychiatric ward. More than 50 family members, friends and current and former colleagues told Dr. Breen’s story to three reporters for The Times: Corina Knoll, Ali Watkins and Michael Rothfeld. They painted a picture of a consummate overachiever. Gifted, confident, clever. Unflappable. She planned thrilling trips, joined a ski club, played cello in an orchestra, took salsa classes and attended Redeemer Presbyterian, a church that attracted high-achieving professionals. Once a year, she gathered all her social circles at a party on her rooftop. In late February, when elected leaders were still assuring the public that the virus did not pose a serious threat, she became convinced it would catch hospitals off guard. And it did, inundating emergency rooms like hers with desperately ill people. There would be bodies every day. Ultimately, during the worst of the crisis, almost a quarter of the people who were admitted to the Allen to be treated for Covid-19 would die. On April 26, Dr. Breen killed herself. Her family believes she should be counted among the pandemic’s casualties. That she was destroyed by the sheer number of people she could not save. That she was mortified to have cried for help. “Lorna kept saying, ‘I think everybody knows I’m struggling,’” her sister said. “She was so embarrassed.” The New York State Department of Health announced on Friday that residents in certain nursing homes would be allowed to have visitors, after being all but cut off to outside guests during the early months of the pandemic. New York originally barred visitors at nursing homes on March 13 over fears they would spread the virus among older people, whom epidemiologists consider to be at an elevated risk of developing life-threatening complications. To date, about 42 percent of deaths in the United States have been linked to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, including more than 6,400 residents or staff members in New York. The toll in New York nursing homes accounts for more than one-tenth of the reported deaths in such facilities across the country. Only those facilities that have gone without any new coronavirus cases among residents and staff for at least 28 days will be eligible to receive visitors, according to the announcement. Even then, only 10 percent of residents at eligible facilities will be allowed to host visitors at the same time. Residents can have visits from up to two individuals at a time, one of whom must be at least 18 years of age. Visitors also will be asked to go through a familiar array of health screenings, including temperature checks at entrances, and to wear face coverings and socially distance while inside. A spokeswoman for the Health Department said that roughly 150 of the more than 600 nursing homes in New York could soon qualify to accept visitors, according to a report from The Associated Press. While most New Yorkers grudgingly accepted New York City’s lockdown in March, one community eagerly embraced it: graffiti writers. Deserted commercial streets with gated storefronts offered thousands of blank canvases. From the South Bronx to East New York, a new generation of graffiti writers has emerged, many of whom have never hit a trainyard or the inside of a subway car. But like early taggers who grew up in a city beset by crime, grime and empty coffers, today’s generation is dealing with its own intense fears over the devastating effects of the coronavirus on communities and the economy. “Does art dictate the times or do the times dictate art?” said John Matos, 58, a graffiti writer known as Crash who started out in the 1970s. “Before now, the streets were sanitized, with pieces that were cool and nice, and done with permission. Now, we’re back to the roots.” Concerns over the virus, as well as the death of George Floyd and others at the hands of the police, have been reflected in the pieces showing up around the city. But a lot of the new tags around town are, on their face, apolitical, though the mere act of writing on a wall is a political statement in itself. “The whole thing with quarantine is that people feel powerless because daily life and activity is very different,” said Eric Felisbret, the author of “Graffiti New York,” who took up aerosol art as a teenager on the Lower East Side. “They can’t control anything. But they can get out there and bomb — that’s something they can control.” Because of the pandemic, the Treasury Department postponed the traditional April 15 federal tax filing deadline until July 15 — and this time there is no wiggle room. Last month, the Internal Revenue Service said there would not be another blanket filing delay. So for anyone who has not yet filed a return — or filed but not yet paid the taxes owed for 2019 — the deadline is Wednesday. “It’s just like April 15, but in July,” said Cindy Hockenberry, the director of tax research and government relations for the National Association of Tax Professionals, a trade group. Not long ago, Colombia and Latin America more broadly were in the middle of a history-making transformation: The scourge of inequality was shrinking like never before. Over the past 20 years, millions of families had marched out of poverty in one of the most unequal regions on Earth. The gap between rich and poor in Latin America fell to its lowest point on record. Now, the pandemic is threatening to reverse those gains like nothing else in recent history, economists say, potentially upending politics and entire societies for years to come. To document this critical moment, two Times reporters, Julie Turkewitz and Sofía Villamil, and a photographer, Federico Rios, traveled more than 1,000 miles across Colombia. Throughout the journey, they witnessed a swift collapse of prosperity. Small businesses had closed for good. Universities were hemorrhaging students. Schools that had turned the children of construction workers into engineers were near collapse, unable to pay teachers. Farmers were burning their crops, ruined by disrupted markets. Parents began rationing medicine to their children, unsure when they would have money for more. Yet while some families sold their cellphones to buy dinner, wealthy people retreated to countryside homes. “It was never my dream to go backward,” said David Aguirre, 32, who had risen from a low-level bodyguard to the boss of his own strawberry farm. “The sacrifice of many people, days of work from 6 to 6 at night, rain, sun. And then — for it all to become nothing?” The number of food-insecure New York City residents has doubled to about two million since the onset of the pandemic. But just as quickly as the need escalated, so, too, did new solutions. Those who help feed the hungry are up early, clipboards in hand, checking on deliveries. They work the phones, begging for donations. They direct employees and a growing army of volunteers. And they try to keep their wits about them, despite the long hours, the long to-do lists and the long lines that are becoming all too common. Red Rabbit, a Harlem-based company that was founded in 2005 by the Wall Street equities trader Rhys Powell to provide meals for schoolchildren, was serving 22,000 meals and snacks a day when schools were shut down in March. Since then, Red Rabbit has started making meals for adults for the first time, with meals distributed to emergency workers, their children and others in the community. Now, 90,000 meals are prepared weekly. And in late March, the Rev. Andrew Marko, the pastor of Evangel Church in Queens, converted the 100,000-square-foot building that houses the church and shuttered school into a mammoth operation to feed those in need.

"For 20 Years, His Firm Called Him Antoine. Now Mohamed Is Suing.",2020-07-11,By Aurelien Breeden,"[""PARIS — Mohamed Amghar was a 40-year-old software salesman in the final stages of interviewing for a new job in November 1996 when, in his telling, his future boss made a request that left him speechless. You’ll have to change your name to “Antoine,” the man said, even specifying, according to Mr. Amghar, not to use ‘‘Philippe’’ because there were already two in the office. Mr. Amghar felt he had no choice. Still, he was ashamed — and angry. “It’s a betrayal,” said Mr. Amghar, born in Paris to Algerian parents who arrived there in 1946, when Algeria was still part of France. “You are made to understand, at 40 years old, that ‘No, Mohamed, you aren’t truly French like everyone else.’” And so, Mohamed became Antoine — on his email address, on his business card, on train and plane tickets, on name tags used at industry conferences, even on performance awards he collected over two decades at the company, Intergraph, an American software firm with French offices in Rungis, south of Paris. Mr. Amghar, now 63 and retired, sued the company last year in a labor court in Créteil, south of Paris, accusing it of discrimination and moral harassment and asking for more than 440,000 euros, or nearly $500,000, in damages. The court held a hearing in March but won’t rule until next year. The case has stood out because few racial discrimination suits reach French courts. And it resonates powerfully as France reckons with its colonial past, racism in the police and attitudes toward racial discrimination more generally in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis. Jacques Toubon, France’s human rights ombudsman, noted this month in a landmark report that studies and official statistics were unequivocal on the extent and “systemic nature” of discrimination in France. “People of a foreign origin or who are perceived as such are more exposed to unemployment, social insecurity, bad housing conditions and poorer health,” he wrote. At the time Mr. Amghar says his boss requested that he use a different name, he had been assured of the position but had not yet signed a contract, and he had already quit his old job. He was divorced with three children — the oldest was 13 at the time. “And I was not stupid,” Mr. Amghar said in an interview at his lawyer’s office in Paris. “I knew that being called Mohamed wasn’t the best passport, not only to get interviews but also a job.” Mr. Amghar says that, relatively speaking, he was fortunate even to get the job given France’s record of discrimination. The sales manager position involved selling engineering software to energy or chemical companies like Total or Arkema and was well-paid. He also acknowledges that he never filed an official complaint over his time at Intergraph, from 1997 to 2017. “I thought to myself: ‘You didn’t say anything in the beginning, what are you going to say now?’” he said. Intergraph, based in Alabama and bought in 2010 by Hexagon AB, a Swedish firm, did not deny that Mr. Amghar used a different name at the office, but said it had found no proof that management had requested the change. Hexagon’s PPM division, which includes Intergraph, said in an email that after receiving Mr. Amghar’s complaint in 2018, it had conducted an “internal investigation” that involved reviewing documents and speaking with current or former employees. But the company said it had “found no evidence of discrimination or that Intergraph France management required Mr. Amghar to change his name, or otherwise required Mr. Amghar to use the name of ‘Antoine’ when representing the company.” “Intergraph has always adhered to a strict standard of ethics and professional conduct in order to prevent all types of discrimination, racism and harassment, which are subjects it takes very seriously,” the company said. Hiring discrimination against Arab or Black minorities in France is widely documented. One recent study where fake applications were submitted to more than 100 blue-chip companies found that candidates with Arab-sounding names were nearly 20 percent less likely to get an answer than those with traditional French ones. “In all the studies that have been done in France, you find significant discriminations based on origin, whether Arab or Black,” said Yannick L’Horty, an economist who led the study with a team of researchers who specialize in assessing labor discriminations and the impact of public policies in the job market. Mr. Amghar’s case is unusual because he was, in fact, hired — which Intergraph is eager to point out. A lawyer representing the company in France declined to comment. But in 2018, responding to a letter from Mr. Amghar’s lawyer that threatened to file a suit barring “amicable reparation,” the firm called the accusations of discrimination “surprising” because Mr. Amghar had been “recruited by Intergraph and stayed there for 20 years.” In the letter, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, the company said that Mr. Amghar’s former boss — who no longer works at Intergraph — did not remember asking him to change names, adding that “one cannot exclude the possibility” that Mr. Amghar himself had chosen ‘‘Antoine.’’ Mr. Amghar, who is meticulously organized, has kept business cards, pay stubs, emails, contracts, security clearance documents, awards, and more, all featuring the name “Antoine.” And while there is no record of the November 1996 interview, Mr. Amghar bristles at the suggestion that he would have intentionally put himself in the awkward position of using two different names. He was once stopped at an airport because his passport didn’t match tickets booked by the company. In  meetings or emails, senior managers sometimes used Antoine while colleagues used Mohamed. On pay slips, he was ‘‘Mohamed Antoine.’’ One award from 2010 even used ‘‘Antoine (Mohamed) Amghar.’’ Mr. Amghar’s closest colleagues quickly learned the truth. But others said they were stunned to discover, months or even years after first meeting him, that Antoine was, in fact, Mohamed. Raoul Tardy, a retiree who worked for Intergraph in Norway from 1991 to 2015, said that Mr. Amghar was introduced to him as Antoine. For several years, that was the name he used on the phone or at meetings. “In the phone directory, it was Antoine. On the business card, it was Antoine. On the organizational chart, it was Antoine. It was Antoine everywhere,” Mr. Tardy said. Then, in the early 2000s on a bus ride during a company gathering in Austria, he overheard colleagues call Mr. Amghar ‘‘Momo,'’ a nickname for Mohamed. Mr. Amghar told him the truth. “I didn’t fall from my seat, but almost,” said Mr. Tardy, one of several former Intergraph employees who submitted written testimonies supporting Mr. Amghar in his suit. “What really shocked me is that none of the French managers tried to fix the problem.” Mr. Amghar is cheerful and quick to joke, but some of his sarcasm hints at deep resentment. For his managers, a man of Arab origin in his position was “inconceivable,” he said. “Mohamed can’t sign a 12 million euro contract and chat with the C.E.O. of a company,” Mr. Amghar said in mock outrage. “It’s not possible!” Frédéric Blas, a former colleague who was an in-house lawyer at Intergraph France from 2011 to 2016, said Mr. Amghar “felt humiliated. There was a real bitterness, a frustration.” There were no explicit instructions from senior managers to use the name Antoine, Mr. Blas said, but that was the name heard and used by those who didn’t work very closely with Mr. Amghar. It was “unsettling,” Mr. Blas added, and sometimes difficult for him not to use Antoine by force of habit. Galina Elbaz, Mr. Amghar’s lawyer, who also works for the International League Against Racism and anti-Semitism — a French civil rights group that has taken interest in his case — said that criminal discrimination cases are rarely prosecuted. “It’s five to six cases a year, barely,” Ms. Elbaz said, adding that often the victims are poor, working, and reluctant to spend months or years, and thousands of euros in lawyer fees, on an uncertain outcome. Mr. Toubon, the human rights ombudsman, noted in his report that among those who had reported personal cases of job discrimination to his office, only 12 percent had taken legal action. Victims do not always have hard proof of the mistreatment, the report noted, and many of them are reluctant to disrupt their professional lives by taking their employer to court. In labor courts — like the one handling Mr. Amghar’s case — there are precedents in his favor. But cases often drag on, Ms. Elbaz said, as the judges are not professional magistrates and aren’t always well versed in anti-discrimination law. Still, Mr. Amghar said it was important for him to file the suit. He recalled his father’s account of racism suffered in Algeria and then in France as a carpentry worker, and he remembered his parents’ faith that French meritocracy would give their children a different experience. “If people like me, who did what was necessary to get good jobs, to get training, to live as citizens, are besmirched and denied our rights, where are we going?” Mr. Amghar said animatedly. “I only have one name, I only have one nationality,” he added. “My name is Mohamed, and I am French.”""]","Mohamed Amghar, a retired software sales manager in France, has filed a discrimination complaint against his former employer, accusing the company of making him use a traditional French name at work."
"Caught Between Indian and Chinese Troops, at 15,000 Feet",2020-07-11,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — First it was cellphone towers, new roads and surveillance cameras, popping up on the Chinese side of the disputed Himalayan border with India.Then it was more run-ins between troops on each side, pushing, shoving and eventually getting into fistfights.Then, about three years ago, Indian soldiers spotted their Chinese foes carrying iron bars with little numbers written on them — a weapon apparently issued as standard gear, and a sign that the Chinese were gearing up for hand-to-hand combat.“This is how China operates,” said J.P. Yadav, a recently retired official with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, on the Indian side. “These are very planned things.”Now, weeks after a deadly brawl erupted along the border, thousands of Chinese and Indian troops are amassed over a contentious, jagged line in one of the most remote places on earth. Satellite photos reveal a major Chinese buildup, including a blizzard of new tents, new storage sheds, artillery pieces and even tanks. Each country has accused the other of provocative actions along the murky border. But according to people who live and work in the region, Ladakh, a Chinese push into Indian territory has been building for years. The area, high up in the Himalayas, has little obvious strategic value, few resources and few people — it’s difficult to even breathe up there, with much of the terrain above 15,000 feet. But India and China, both in the grip of increasingly nationalistic governments, will not give an inch of territory, even along a border so remote that it has never been conclusively mapped.The Ladakhis caught in between are a fragile group, numbering perhaps a few hundred thousand. They are Tibetan in culture, identify themselves as Indian and have long been pulled in different directions at the edges of empire.“If we don’t speak now, it will be too late,” said Rigzin Spalbar, a Ladakhi politician. “The Chinese have intruded and encroached on our land. Even the media is not telling the truth. They are only showing the things that the government wants to them to show.” Mr. Spalbar and other prominent Ladakhis insist that they have reported Chinese incursions for years, but that the Indian military refused to do anything about it. They say there was a code of silence, in which the Indian media was complicit, and that the Indian armed forces didn’t want to face the fact that a more powerful and aggressive military was steadily nibbling away at its territory. Indian Army officials declined to comment for this article. Chinese officials have been stingy with details as well, including about whether any Chinese troops were killed in the clash in June. Western intelligence agents, who see the border as one of Asia’s most dangerous flash points, say they think that China lost more than a dozen soldiers in the fight. In early July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India swooped into Ladakh, rallying the troops while wearing a puffy green army jacket and aviator-style shades. “Friends,” he vowed, “the era of expansionism is over,” implying that India was willing to push back against China. Years ago, the two countries agreed that their troops should not shoot at each other during border standoffs. But the Chinese seem to be testing the limits. In the June fighting, which left 20 Indians and an unknown number of Chinese dead, Indian commanders say that Chinese troops used iron clubs bristling with spikes. Many analysts say that China’s actions in Ladakh mirror the more assertive approach China has taken across Asia, especially in the South China Sea, since its leader, Xi Jinping, took over in 2012. And Mr. Modi’s brand of renewed Indian nationalism may also have provoked the Chinese. The Indians, too, have also been building military roads along the disputed border, known as the Line of Actual Control. And Indian officials recently promised to take back Aksai Chin, a high-altitude plateau that India says is part of Ladakh but that China controls and claims as its own. Aksai Chin is “a very important strategic place” to the Chinese military, said Yue Gang, a retired colonel in the People’s Liberation Army. If India were to seize it, he said, it “would cut the transportation between Tibet and Xinjiang,” two restive areas that China is constantly concerned about.  In culture, language, history and Buddhism, Ladakh is close to Tibet. But Ladakhi scholars are firm about one thing: They don’t want to be part of China. “Ladakhis see themselves as Indians,” said Sonam Joldan, a Ladakhi political scientist. Up until a few years ago, Ladakhi and Tibetan nomads roamed freely, pushing their herds of goats, sheep and yak across the lonely, high-altitude plains. They used to converge along a stretch of the Line of Actual Control and barter. The Ladakhis carried Indian products like basmati rice; the Tibetans brought Chinese-made goods like plastic Thermoses. The trading sessions ended, Ladakhis say, after Chinese troops occupied the area. This is hardly the first time Ladakh has been swept up into geopolitics. In the mid-19th century, the British helped set up the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which seems to stretch endlessly across the Himalayas. The British, who controlled the Indian subcontinent, believed that the bigger the buffer zone against the Russian empire, the better. So they allowed the maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir to also grab neighboring Ladakh, enabling him to corner the lucrative trade in pashmina wool. This part of Asia is known for its cashmere (the word for which is derived from Kashmir), and Ladakh’s longhaired Changthangi goats produce especially fine pashmina. But even after several treaties were signed, the border between Ladakh and China was never neatly defined. It snakes across high mountains that few people have ever climbed. “There were different narratives during the British times,” said Siddiq Wahid, a scholar of Central Asian history. “Aksai Chin was a part of Tibet, and it was not a part of Tibet, it was part of Ladakh and not part of Ladakh.” Shortly after India gained independence in 1947 and Pakistan was created, war erupted between the two countries over Jammu and Kashmir. The princely state, which had hoped to stay independent, hurriedly agreed to be part of India, and thus Ladakh became Indian. In 1950, China invaded Tibet and soon built a road linking it to Xinjiang, slicing through Aksai Chin. The area was so desolate that it wasn’t until several years later that India even found out about the road. This triggered a brief war in 1962 that ended in a disastrous loss for India, and China seized all of Aksai Chin, more than 14,000 square miles. By the mid-1970s, things had cooled down, at least on the China front. A protocol evolved between Indian and Chinese troops, including a ban on firearms during border standoffs and regular meetings to iron out disputes. Things were still hot with Pakistan, though. The same piece of territory, Jammu and Kashmir, has propelled India into repeated conflicts with both Pakistan and China — two nations which, like India, have nuclear arms today. Indian soldiers who served along the China border in the 1980s and 1990s remember friendly interactions with the Chinese troops. “We used to shake hands and they would take photos with us and we would take photos with them,” said Sonam Murup, a retired officer. Those visits with the Chinese were welcome distractions. Soldiers stationed along the border had to tramp around a frozen moonscape for weeks, with little food or water. “We’d wash our face once maybe every 15 or 16 days,” Mr. Murup recalled. But the bonhomie with the Chinese ended years ago. Ladakhis say Chinese troops have blocked herders’ access to Indian territory in areas like Demchok and Pangong Tso, a scenic lake where several brawls have erupted. Indian officers say they have tried to follow protocols for avoiding confrontation, like unfurling banners that read “This Is Indian Territory” in English and Chinese, but that the Chinese refuse to listen. Indian commanders acknowledge that their soldiers, too, now carry hand weapons, like bamboo sticks and sling shots. The Chinese have clearly outpaced India in developing the region, Indian commanders concede, which could give them a strategic advantage in a conflict. “They have better facilities,” said Mr. Yadav, the former border official. He said China had paved a highway running right along the border and that Chinese border troops were resupplied by military vehicles carrying supplemental oxygen. But Mr. Yadav said the Indians had some advantages. He claimed the Chinese troops were in poorer shape, saying, “They don’t walk much.” More important, he added: “They have not seen war, while on our side our soldiers have been waging war every day in Kashmir.” Hari Kumar and Sameer Yasir contributed reporting from New Delhi, Iqbal Kirmani from Leh, India, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul, South Korea.']","Ladakh is a place of high-altitude pastures, lonely herders and desolate moonscapes — and a byword for intractable geopolitical disputes."
Seoul Mayor Is Found Dead After Harassment Complaint Is Filed,2020-07-09,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The mayor of Seoul, the country’s second-most powerful official and a potential presidential candidate, was found dead just days after a secretary in his office told the police that he had sexually harassed her since 2017, the authorities said on Friday. A Seoul police officer confirmed early Friday that the body of the mayor, Park Won-soon, had been discovered on a hill in northern Seoul, several hours after his daughter had reported him missing.  Word of the mayor’s death and its possible links to sexual misconduct sent shock waves across the country, not only because Mr. Park was a political star but also because he had long been seen as a champion of women’s rights. His positions stood out in a country where men dominate society’s upper echelons, enforcing a strictly hierarchical code that analysts say makes women vulnerable to abuse and forces its victims to stay silent. Mr. Park, 64, had canceled his official schedule and called in sick to City Hall on Thursday, the day after the secretary had filed her complaint. His daughter told the police that he had left home after leaving a cryptic, “will-like message,” according to Yonhap, the national news agency, which cited an anonymous police source. That detail immediately fueled speculation that Mr. Park could have taken his own life. The discovery of Mr. Park’s body came after nearly 600 police officers and emergency medical workers, aided by police dogs, searched the hills in northern Seoul, where his cellphone signal had last been detected. Mr. Park left his home in a taxi on Thursday morning and got out at a park several minutes later, said Choi Ik-su, a senior detective at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, citing closed-circuit footage. Mr. Park’s body was found in a wooded hill behind the park with the help of a police dog, Mr. Choi said. The police found no suicide note at the scene, he said, but there was also no sign that Mr. Park had been killed by someone else. Hundreds of Mr. Park’s supporters  — some tearfully shouting “We love you, Park Won-soon!” — gathered on Friday in front of Seoul National University Hospital, where his body had been taken for an autopsy. Mr. Park, who was serving his third term as mayor of Seoul, a city of 10 million, had often been cited as a possible successor to President Moon Jae-in, whose single five-year term is set to expire in 2022. Mr. Park’s mayoral term had been scheduled to end in 2022. Before becoming mayor, Mr. Park was a prominent human rights attorney who founded the country’s most influential civil rights group. As a lawyer, he won several major cases, including South Korea’s first sexual harassment case. He also campaigned for the rights of so-called comfort women, Korean sex slaves who were lured or forced to work in brothels for the Japanese Army during World War II. During the military dictatorship of the 1980s, Mr. Park helped win the conviction of a police officer who molested a female student activist during an interrogation. In the 1990s, he helped win damages for a teaching assistant at Seoul National University who accused her professor of refusing to rehire her after she protested unwanted sexual advances. It was the first sexual harassment case in South Korean history. In recent years, the #MeToo movement has rippled across South Korea, leading to a series of high-profile cases. Women have come forward with accusations of sexual abuse against an array of prominent men, including theater directors, politicians, professors, religious leaders and a former coach for the national speedskating team. Many of the accused have apologized and resigned from their positions. Several have faced criminal charges. In April, Oh Keo-don, mayor of Busan, South Korea’s second-largest city, admitted to sexual misconduct and resigned after a public servant accused him of sexually assaulting her in his office. In 2018, Ahn Hee-jung, a rising star in President Moon’s governing Democratic Party and a presidential hopeful, stepped down as governor of South Chungcheong Province after his secretary went on television to accuse him of repeatedly sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on rape charges. President Moon has supported the #MeToo movement, but accusations against prominent allies have been particularly disturbing for his governing liberal camp. Mr. Park, Mr. Ahn and Mr. Oh were all considered prominent members of the president’s Democratic Party. Mr. Park and Mr. Ahn had built successful careers as activists who fought for democracy and human rights under the country’s past military dictatorship. Politicians with backgrounds like theirs have long been treated by South Koreans as holding a higher moral ground than their conservative counterparts, many of whom were connected to the dictatorship. Mr. Park helped found the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, one of South Korea’s most powerful civic groups, which campaigned against corrupt ties between politics and big businesses in a country that has been plagued by scandal. He had a reputation for being a tireless critic of inequality and a vocal antagonist of former President Park Geun-hye, supporting huge rallies against her in central Seoul that ultimately led to her impeachment and ouster on corruption charges in 2017. He had also been one of the most aggressive leaders in South Korea in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, taking a series of steps aimed at containing its spread, like shutting down nightclubs. Seoul has reported only 1,390 cases. South Korea has the highest suicide rate among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It has been rare for politicians in South Korea to take their own lives out of public shame. But former President Roh Moo-hyun killed himself amid allegations of corruption against his family in 2009. Another popular liberal politician, Roh Hoe-chan, also killed himself in 2018 when he faced allegations of corruption.']","Mayor Park Won-soon, who vanished after leaving a cryptic message for his daughter, had faced a newly filed complaint from his secretary."
"‘I’m Sorry to Everyone’: In Death, South Korean Mayor Is Tainted by Scandal",2020-07-10,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Mayor Park Won-soon of Seoul spoke passionately at a news conference on Wednesday about his vision to create jobs and fight climate change in a post-pandemic world, part of his broader, socially conscious campaign that also called for building a city that was more innovative and safer for women. The same day, one of his secretaries went to the police, accusing him of sexual harassment. She described how Mr. Park made unwanted physical contact and sent sexually suggestive, dehumanizing texts to her on the encrypted messaging service Telegram, usually late at night, according to local media. The next day, Mr. Park called in sick. He canceled his entire schedule. At his desk in the two-story official residence, he wrote a note to his family, asking them to cremate his body and scatter the ashes around the graves of his parents in his hometown. “I’m sorry to everyone, and I thank everyone who has been with me in my life,” he wrote in longhand in the note, which was released by his aide. “I remain always sorry to my family, to whom I’ve only brought pain.” “Goodbye, everyone,” Mr. Park said. Hours later, Mr. Park was found dead, presumably by suicide, on a wooded hill in northern Seoul, an unexpected end to one of the most storied political lives in South Korea. As mayor of Seoul, Mr. Park was the second most powerful elected official, and considered a potential successor to President Moon Jae-in, whose term ends in 2022. A civil rights and anti-corruption lawyer, he was an early champion for the rights of the homeless and the disabled. He took on business tycoons and authoritarian governments. He won the country’s first sexual harassment case. Mr. Park has been a “great civil-society leader” and “a global-minded leader” who seldom missed domestic and international conferences on climate change, said former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who met with Mr. Park on \u200bTuesday during one such meeting. “People will miss him,” Mr. Ban said in an interview. Mr. Park did not explain his motive for suicide, and it is impossible to know exactly what he was thinking. But in South Korea, public sentiments toward a prominent figure embroiled in scandal often turn from outrage to sympathy after the person commits suicide, and prosecutors usually close the case. After President Roh Moo-hyun killed himself in 2009 following allegations of corruption, many South Koreans considered him a victim of political revenge by his conservative enemies. Mr. Park faced the threat of serious legal scrutiny and political backlash over the sexual harassment accusations, which were reported by local media. As in other countries, the #MeToo movement has gained tremendous force in South Korea, holding to account elected officials, theater directors, university professors, religious leaders and a former coach for the national speedskating team. A #MeToo allegation threatened the very core of Mr. Park’s political identity. In the mayor’s office, he called himself a “feminist,” and created the country’s first municipal committee on gender equality. “As your father, I take a small comfort in the fact that I have never committed big sins or done things people would blame me for,” he wrote to his son and daughter in his wills, which he made public in a memoir published in 2002. Mr. Park, one of seven children in his family, grew up in rural South Korea during the destitute years following the 1950-53 Korean War. Mr. Park remembered, in his 2002 memoir, how he took a cheap night train carrying “nothing but a small bundle of books” to attend an elite high school in Seoul. His parents could only afford tuition for their sons. He said that he felt forever indebted to his sisters, who sacrificed their schooling for his education. Shortly after enrolling in Seoul National University, the country’s most prestigious, Mr. Park joined an anti-government protest, getting jailed for four months and expelled from school. Barred from returning to the university by the military dictatorship, he ended up at Dankook University in Seoul as a history major and later passed the bar exam. As a lawyer, he won a host of landmark cases for press freedoms and women’s rights. After winning the country’s first sexual harassment case, he was honored with the “women’s rights award” in 1998 from the nation’s top women’s groups. The People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a civic group he helped found, has become a leading watchdog on corrupt ties between the government and big businesses, launching investigations and lawsuits that have often led to convictions of business tycoons on corruption charges. The group was involved in the lawsuits that led to the 2009 conviction of Lee Kun-hee, chairman of Samsung, on charges of embezzlement and tax evasion. In his nine years as Seoul’s mayor, Mr. Park, drove an endless series of policy initiatives. He \u200blowered college tuitions, installed \u200ba free Wi-Fi connection in public parking lots and municipal parks\u200b, and converted part-time workers in city-financed corporations to full-time employees. He also pushed to make Seoul’s streets safer at night for women, by deploying escorts for women walking in deserted alleys where crimes had taken place. He also introduced a smartphone app for women that alerts the police when they face danger at night. Female “sheriffs” also check public toilets for women in Seoul to find and destroy hidden sex cams. His leadership shined in the coronavirus battle in Seoul, a city of 10 million that has contained the outbreak to 1,390 cases. Mr. Park was quick to institute aggressive social-distancing policies, including banning outdoor rallies and shutting down nightclubs. There has been plenty of criticism about his tenure as well. Protesters have often picketed City Hall, calling Mr. Park a “commie” for promoting reconciliation with North Korea and for his past opposition to the deployment of troops from South Korea to Iraq. But Mr. Park had always taken such criticism in stride, considering it the cost of holding a high-profile job. A known workaholic, his absence from the office on Thursday was notable. He canceled his staff meetings, as well as an afternoon appointment with the chairman of a presidential committee. At 10:44 a.m., Mr. Park left his residence in Gahoe-dong, a neighborhood that attracts foreign tourists with its old Korean houses with graceful tiled roofs and gardens. He looked like a man going on a hike with a small backpack, but was unseasonably dressed for summer in a dark jacket, black pants and a hat, according to footage from closed-circuit surveillance cameras. He also wore a face mask as many South Koreans do in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Passers-by would not have recognized him. He got out of a taxi several minutes later at the quiet, wooded Waryong Park on the foot of Bukak Mountain, where ancient kings built stone walls to guard their palace from invaders from China and Manchuria. A little over six hours later, his daughter called the police to report him missing. \u200bShe told them that he left home after leaving a “\u200bstrange” note, according to the authorities. When she tried to call him, his cellphone had been turned off. A vast search began, starting where his cellphone signal was last detected in the well-off district of Sungbuk that is home to many foreign ambassadors. Nearby is Gilsangsa, a Buddhist temple famous for its garden. Mr. Park was a Buddhist. More than 770 police\u200b \u200band fire department officers, aided by nine dogs and six heat-detecting drones, scoured several neighborhoods. As night fell, the officers, wearing nightglow vests and armed with searchlights, expanded the search up the hills along the numerous hiking trails. A fire department dog, named Sobaek after the mountain range in the southern part of the country, found Mr. Park a minute past midnight. “He had his backpack and a water bottle with him,” Shin Jun-young, the dog handler, said of the mayor. “We found his hat hanging on a tree.” News flashes about the discovery of Mr. Park’s body circulated quickly through South Korea, especially in Seoul, where many people stayed up late for updates. When the ambulance pulled into Seoul National University Hospital at 3 a.m., hundreds of officials and supporters were there. Some of them were wailing and shouting: “Wake up, Park Won-soon,” “We love you, Park Won-soon,” and “We’re sorry, Park Won-soon.” A man shouted, “How can you go now, with so much work undone?” The city government has urged the news media to refrain from carrying unconfirmed allegations against Mr. Park, in an apparent reference to lurid details of sexual misconduct circulating on social media. Mr. Park’s family issued a statement through his aide \u200basking the media not to recirculate “one-sided accusations or groundless information” against him. “He was stronger and more passionate than anybody else, so it is natural for you to ask ‘Why?’” said Lee Min-ju, Mr. Park’s press aide. “But he chose to end his life and bury everything with him without leaving his side of the story. So all the reports about this case will be essentially speculative.” South Korea’s social media brimmed with condolences. But there were also people who objected to burying the #MeToo accusations with him, accusing the city of Seoul of trying to whitewash the scandal at the expense of the whistle-blower. Nearly 250,000 people signed an online petition to oppose holding an extraordinary five-day funeral service for Mr. Park. Ordinary South Koreans usually practice a three-day funeral service. “Now that Mr. Park Won-soon is dead, the allegations of sexual harassment will be closed without even an investigation,” the petitioner said. “But are we sure that his death is an honorable one?” “What kind of message do they want to deliver to the people?” the person asked.

"In Latin America, the Pandemic Threatens Equality Like Never Before",2020-07-11,"By Julie Turkewitz, Sofía Villamil and Federico Rios","['Over the past two decades, inequality in Latin America had fallen to the lowest point in its recorded history. The pandemic threatens to reverse that. We traveled 1,000 miles across Colombia to document this critical moment. BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Sandra Abello grew up poor, left school at 11 and spent her teenage years scrubbing floors as a live-in maid. But by this year, something remarkable had happened. Ms. Abello, now 39, finally had a home in a decent neighborhood. One of her daughters, Karol, was about to finish high school. Another, Nicol, was turning 15, and they were planning a party with a big dress and many guests. They were saving for a washing machine. Ms. Abello was proud of all she had accomplished. Then the pandemic hit, and Ms. Abello lost her cleaning work. By May, she had been evicted, forcing her to move her children into a tin shed in an illegal settlement high above the city. At night, a bitter cold pushed its way in. A lifetime of effort had evaporated in a matter of weeks. Ms. Abello’s oldest daughter, Karol, an aspiring nurse, called it the “great regression.” Not long ago, Colombia — and Latin America more broadly — were in the middle of a history-making transformation: The scourge of inequality was shrinking like never before. Over the past 20 years, millions of families had marched out of poverty in one of the most unequal regions on earth. The gap between rich and poor in Latin America fell to its lowest point on record. Now, the pandemic is threatening to reverse those gains like nothing else in recent history, economists say, potentially upending politics and entire societies for years to come. We — two reporters and a photographer with The New York Times — wanted to understand what this meant for the region’s future, and in particular for the families that had been so central to that march toward economic equality. So we began to drive, packing the car with masks and traveling more than 1,000 miles from Colombia’s capital to the northeastern border and back, interviewing dozens of people about the way the pandemic was changing the course of their lives. As we went, leaving the mountain-flanked high-rises of Bogotá for the tropical regions beyond, it became clear that the engines of upward mobility were failing, choked off by an economic shutdown that began in March and fell hardest on the working poor and vulnerable members of the middle class. Small businesses had closed for good. Universities were hemorrhaging students. Schools that had turned the children of construction workers into engineers were near collapse, unable to pay teachers. Farmers were burning their crops, ruined by disrupted markets. Teenage boys had turned to selling drugs to feed their siblings. Young women and girls had been pushed into prostitution to pay the bills. Mothers and fathers began rationing medicine to their children, unsure when they would have money for more. Wealthy people retreated to countryside homes, while other families sold their cellphones to buy dinner. “It was never my dream to go backward,” said David Aguirre, 32, who had risen from a low-level bodyguard to the boss of his own strawberry farm. He had poured his life savings into his business, opening just a few months before the pandemic struck. Now it was unclear if the farm would survive. When we met, he’d just fired his four workers and killed off a quarter of his crop — unable to find a buyer and unable to pay his employees to pick it. The berries lay dry and cracked around us, poisoned with Roundup, and he worried about returning to the dangerous work of protecting the wealthy. “The sacrifice of many people, days of work from 6 to 6 at night, rain, sun,” he said. “And then — for it all to become nothing?” Bogotá Even on the first day of our journey, we could see the distance between the rich and poor widening. We drove into the hills above the capital, to an encampment of hastily built sheds that had long been a last resort for desperate families. When the lockdown began, the settlement quickly swelled with people like Ms. Abello who had been moving up — bakery employees, preschool janitors — but lost their jobs and apartments. The pandemic hadn’t just stalled their progress. It suddenly made them squatters. That day, the police arrived with a wrecking crew, saying that the settlement was illegal and too precariously built to live in, even if tearing it down exacerbated the pain of the pandemic. Ms. Abello’s walls fell with a terrifying clatter. For the second time in the brief life of the crisis, she and her family had nowhere to go. Medellín Eight hours outside of Bogotá, the school appeared like a sanctuary on a hill, ringed by an expansive lawn and a gate. The institution, Mi Segundo Hogar, had played a life-changing role for families of modest means over the years, offering low-cost, high-quality education. It produced flight attendants and pharmacists in families where the parents had walked barefoot to class. Now, the school sat empty, with in-person classes canceled across Latin America. Unemployed parents had stopped paying fees, sometimes apologizing profusely through text message, and the school was barely paying instructors. On the patio, the rector, Lina Castrillón, said Mi Segundo Hogar was in danger of closing. Technically, classes had moved online, but only a fraction of the students were able to connect every day. Many didn’t have computers, or tried to log on via cellphone, and data was expensive. It was not just that her students were going to slide backward in their learning, Ms. Castrillón said. She worried this interruption would fundamentally reshape their lives, leading to dropouts and lower pay, stunting an entire generation. At home, disconnected from school, she said, “they are losing their vision” of a better future. For years, Colombia was a glaring example of the region’s wealth gap — and of the struggles to narrow it. The nation’s generations-long war with rebels grew out of anger over inequality. Class divisions are so baked into society that poorer people refer to wealthier ones as “your mercy” in casual conversation, a relic of colonialism. Cities are divided into “estratos,” which signify one’s social class. The rich live in estrato six. The poor live in estrato one. Those in informal settlements — which legally don’t exist — live in what people colloquially call “estrato zero.” But life had been changing, considerably. Colombia, one of the most unequal countries in an extremely inequitable region, cut its poverty rate nearly in half, to 27 percent, from 2002 to 2018. The country signed a historic peace deal with the main rebel group, promising to help thousands on the economic and social margins join the nation’s success. The gulf between rich and poor was still stubbornly wide compared with much of the world. In the 1990s, the wealthiest 10 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean earned about 50 times more than the poorest 10 percent, according to Matías Busso, an economist with the Inter-American Development Bank. By the time the pandemic hit, top earners made an average 22 times what the poorest made. So while inequality clung to the region, it had fallen to a record low, he said. Now, the pandemic could push poverty and inequality back to what they were at the turn of the 21st century in Colombia, according to an analysis by professors at the Universidad de los Andes. “A setback of two decades,” they called it. Economists are predicting similar regressions around the region, with the World Bank warning that more than 50 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean could fall into poverty this year alone. “The current crisis is probably the biggest threat to inequality that we have experienced,” Mr. Busso said. In Medellín, we watched hundreds of single mothers line up outside a food bank that expanded significantly when the crisis began. One woman, María Camila Salazar, 22, said her mother, María Eugenia Carvalho, 53, had become so dangerously malnourished that her thin shoulders now jutted from her frame. “We go to bed without eating, without giving anything to our children,” she said. Before the pandemic, Carolina Urda, 31, who runs the food bank, had been working to expand a sewing and washing business meant to move women in unstable jobs — nannies, recycling collectors — into something more secure. The women now had no jobs at all, and Ms. Urda was spending hours each week gathering food to feed their families. “But we don’t want more food,” she said, shaking two fists in frustration. “We want empowered, self-sufficient, autonomous businesswomen.” Bucaramanga Perhaps the most glaring image of Latin America’s backslide was the highway. We had expected to find empty routes. Instead, mile after mile, we met processions of Venezuelan migrants pulling suitcases toward home. They had come to Colombia only a few years or even months before, part of an exodus of migrants escaping Venezuela’s political and economic collapse. Many had hoped to learn a trade or finish a degree in Colombia, or just make enough money to help their families back home. Now, because of the pandemic, the people we met had lost whatever small hold they had on a life in Colombia — a job, an apartment — and were migrating in reverse, returning to a nation where they were almost certain that disaster awaited. Most said they had family in Venezuela who could help them, while in Colombia they no longer had anything. “Hope is over,” said one man, Rafael Decena, 50. Since the pandemic began, more than 80,000 Venezuelans have crossed back into their country, according to Colombian authorities. In Bucaramanga, a midsize city in Colombia, hundreds of migrant families camped outside a park to rest. One night, a parade of buses arrived, a fleet sent by the Colombian government to take people the last 120 miles to the border. Roraima Daversa, 26, and her son Amado, 9, climbed aboard, their feet cracked and blistered. They had spent night after night sleeping on the side of the road. As Ms. Daversa took a seat, tears began rolling down her face. She felt relief. She and Amado no longer had to walk. “Every day he asked, ‘How much longer?’” But there was also grief. Ms. Daversa, who had studied environmental management in Venezuela, had hoped to save money in Bogotá and return to her country to open a business. Now, she was headed back, worse off than when she left. Cúcuta In Cúcuta, a town pressed up against the Venezuelan border, a 17-year-old stood in a cranberry-colored T-shirt and jean shorts, tugging at a purse with a shiny bow, swinging one heel nervously. A few men approached. A ribbon of cars roared past. When the lockdown began, her father lost his job in construction and the refrigerator emptied. Pushed to desperation, she made the excruciating decision to head to a local park, where men began to pay her for sex, $6 an encounter. She was not even the youngest one there to do so. Somebody had to bring in money, she said, “and it turned to me.” Before the crisis, she had been selling small items — cigarettes, candy — in the street. But she had always dreamed of returning to school, of becoming a criminologist like those powerful women on television. Having sex with strangers is “horrible,” she said, and when she has to, she imagines herself in a classroom, with her friends, to distract herself. Over the past two decades, school attendance and rising access to birth control played a crucial role in shrinking the country’s wealth gap, allowing millions of women to study and work, when so many of their mothers had been forced to stay home. When the pandemic hit, though, the number of women forced into prostitution swelled in Cúcuta, said Alejandra Vera, the director of a local advocacy group. So did the number of unwanted pregnancies, as travel restrictions and job losses made it difficult to get condoms and other types of birth control. One morning, the 17-year-old, whose name is being withheld because she is a minor, woke before dawn to the pleas of her son, six months old, who wanted to toddle along the floor and play. She made coffee and dropped off her son with his father at a house down the road. Her mother, 54, saw her off from their patio. She knew what her daughter was doing. It is hard for her to talk about. “I don’t criticize or condemn,” the mother said. “There’s no work now,” she added, breaking down. “This is not a life.” Bogotá Back in Bogotá, Ms. Abello, the mother who had been evicted twice amid the pandemic, had moved in with a friend, both families crammed together. Karol, the aspiring nurse, was trying her best to keep up with classes, but she couldn’t log into the school website without the internet, so a friend was downloading the assignments and texting them to her. She then completed them by hand, took pictures and texted them back. But it was hard, and she worried she was falling behind. Nicol, the younger daughter, turned 15. They had a small celebration, just family, and she wore Karol’s old dress, black, with tulle. As the quarantine loosened, Ms. Abello finally returned to her job cleaning a bakery. But her housekeeping clients never asked her back, and she was earning about half as much as she did before. It wasn’t clear when they’d be able to move into their own place. “This has been hard on my mom,” said Karol. “As soon as this is over, I hope she gets new work and we can go back to our old lives.” “Well,” she said, “God willing.” Jenny Carolina González contributed reporting from Bogotá.']",
"In South Africa, Burial Traditions Upended by Coronavirus",2020-07-10,By Peter Luhanga and Kimon de Greef,"['KHAYELITSHA, South Africa — In ordinary times, there would have been no question where Zinzile Mweli would be buried: alongside his ancestors in the village where he was born. But when Mr. Mweli, a minibus taxi owner, died last month from Covid-19 in Cape Town, 600 miles west of his hometown, his family was forced to confront a new predicament for many Black South Africans during the pandemic: Would it be possible to return his body home for a funeral, accompanied by his loved ones from Cape Town? In March, South Africa imposed one of the world’s most severe lockdowns in response to the coronavirus, restricting travel between provinces. This disrupted a deeply important cultural practice for many Black residents in Cape Town: returning the bodies of family members to the neighboring Eastern Cape province for burial. The new rules around travel for funerals are so complex, and add such extra expense, that they have become practically insurmountable for many families, according to funeral directors and community leaders in Cape Town. For some poorer families, the rules are forcing a choice between breaking tradition and breaking the law. “It’s a big trauma,” said Chris Stali, the director of a funeral parlor in Khayelitsha, the informal settlement on the outskirts of Cape Town where Mr. Mweli lived while working in the city. While South Africa is now attempting to reopen, and easing some restrictions, the rules around funerals are still in place. Attendance at funerals is capped at 50, and overnight vigils and body viewings are banned. The regulations have been felt especially acutely in Cape Town, the initial epicenter of the country’s outbreak. South Africa now ranks 14th in the world for coronavirus cases, and is experiencing an enormous rise, with more than 13,500 cases reported in 24 hours on Thursday. To date, the country has reported more than 224,000 cases and more than 3,600 deaths — and about 60 percent of these deaths were in the Western Cape province, where Cape Town lies. Social distancing in townships like Khayelitsha is all but impossible — entire families often share single, one-room shacks, packed tightly beside their neighbors — and infections are continuing to climb here. But infections are also surging in other provinces — in Gauteng, where Johannesburg is, cases recently doubled within eight days — and experts warn that the rise in deaths may pose similar problems for families there who wish to bury loved ones in rural areas. The majority of Khayelitsha’s approximately 400,000 residents are Xhosa people from the Eastern Cape who return home for holidays and major life events — and eventually, to be buried. But health officials fear that mourners from the city will carry the virus to rural areas that are among the most vulnerable in South Africa. So now, after a loved one’s death, relatives living in Cape Town must apply for travel permits with the police, and only close family members are given permission: no cousins, no close friends, no neighbors. There have also been changes to how a body is moved that have made the cost prohibitive for poorer families. Before the outbreak, it was common for mourners to pack together closely in a minibus and to tow the body behind in a trailer. Now, the corpse must be transported in a separate vehicle, attended by a certified undertaker, meaning that cash-strapped families must hire at least two vehicles. To get around the restrictions, some mourners are forging travel permits, bribing officials or taking long backcountry routes to avoid roadblocks. “If there is a regulation that will interfere with cultural or spiritual beliefs,” said Kenny McDillon, a pastor who operates a funeral repatriations service in Cape Town, “the ordinary citizen will become a criminal.” Mr. Mweli tested positive for the virus on May 4, as community transmission of the virus began accelerating. He was dead within a week, at age 68. His family “didn’t even consider” burying him in Cape Town, said Mr. Mweli’s niece, Fezeka Nkubo. As in many African cultures, they believed it essential to bury Mr. Mweli beside his ancestors, smoothing his passage into an afterlife where spirits of the dead mingle with the living. This burial tradition acquired additional significance in South Africa under white rule, when the migrant labor system drew Black workers into cities but forbade them from settling permanently there, said Professor Leslie Bank, an anthropologist at the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa. This cemented the practice of repatriated funerals and gave rise to an entire industry designed to facilitate them, from insurance plans to transportation services. “Communities are very distressed at the idea of burials not being fulfilled,” said Dr. Thobile Mbengashe, the head of the Eastern Cape health department. “Even if you block the road, they’ll still want to come.” Dr. Mbengashe acknowledged that several bodies had been “smuggled through the system” after the restrictions were imposed. The Western Cape and Eastern Cape provincial governments have been weighing even tougher restrictions, including further limiting how many people can travel to funerals, which is currently capped at 50. “When the curve starts going up, we can’t have that many people traveling,” said Alan Winde, the leader of the Western Cape government. “It’s not a comfortable discussion to be having,” he added. “To be saying, at some stage, you can’t bury people at home.” The wrenching effects of the national regulations already in place are clear to Mr. Stali, the undertaker. On a weekend in June, two mourning families he was working with from Khayelitsha were turned back at a roadblock near the provincial border between the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape for not complying with regulations requiring people to travel in separate vehicles from the body. Mr. Stali hastily arranged funerals for the families in Cape Town, instead. “I had to give them the cheapest funerals I could provide,” he said. Dozens of other families have resorted to burying in Cape Town, said Mzanywa Ndibongo, the chairman of the Khayelitsha Health Forum, a community organization. “It is not their wish to bury here,” he said, “but because of the regulations, they are forced to do that.” The experience of Mr. Mweli’s family shows just how daunting the regulations can be. After he died in May, his family struggled for days to get travel permits. First they needed a letter from the hospital confirming his death. Then they had to apply for a death certificate from the national home affairs department — but officials were unduly afraid of contracting the virus from the paper with Mr. Mweli’s fingerprints, a problem that took days to resolve. Finally, the family lined up for hours at the police station for travel permits. The national regulations state that Covid-19 victims are supposed to be buried within three to seven days; by the time the family received their permits, more than a week had passed. Nevertheless, they were able to travel home to the village of Xonxa, where Mr. Mweli had met his wife nearly 50 years ago and from where they left for Cape Town in 1985. The family rode in one of Mr. Mweli’s taxis, to save on travel costs, with an undertaker transporting the body separately. Bodies of Covid-19 victims are required to travel directly to the grave, and local health officials took possession of the coffin when it reached the village. The family waited to be called for the funeral. But later that day, they found out from local officials that Mr. Mweli had been buried without them. “We don’t even know if it was the right coffin,” said Ms. Nkubo, Mr. Mweli’s niece. The family, now back in Cape Town, believes that his spirit is not at peace, Ms. Nkubo said — and that this, in turn, will bring them misfortune. As soon as possible, they plan to return once more to Xonxa, where they will exhume Mr. Mweli and lay him to rest. Peter Luhanga reported from Cape Town, and Kimon de Greef from New York.']",Restrictions on travel have disrupted a deeply important cultural practice for many Black residents in Cape Town: returning the body for burial hundreds of miles home in the Eastern Cape province.
‘I Felt Defenseless’: Seoul Mayor’s Secretary Speaks Out About Alleged Abuse,2020-07-13,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The secretary to one of the most powerful political figures in South Korea, Mayor Park Won-soon of Seoul, described suffering years of abuse and sexual harassment at his hands, calling in her first public statement on Monday for a world where women can be treated “like humans.” The statement was released hours after the funeral of Mr. Park, who committed suicide last week after his secretary went to the police with her accusations. “I felt defenseless and weak before the immense power,” the woman said in a statement released through her lawyer at a news conference on Monday. “I wanted to shout at him in a safe court of law, telling him to stop it. I wanted to cry out how much he has hurt me.” “I wanted to forgive him,” the statement continued. “I wanted him to be judged in a court of law and to apologize to me as a fellow human.” While his mindset is unknown, Mr. Park, a lifelong champion of women and the second most powerful official in Seoul after the president, killed himself on Thursday, a day after his secretary, whose name and other personal information were not released, went to the police with her allegations. In his suicide note, Mr. Park did not mention the accusations, saying only that he was “sorry to everyone.” On Monday, the woman’s lawyer, as well as activists, called for an investigation, saying she had been widely vilified on social media, where online trolls tried to reveal her identity and blamed her for driving the popular mayor to kill himself. Under the legal procedures of South Korea, Mr. Park’s criminal case is closed, and there will be no indictment, because the suspect is dead. “What has happened doesn’t go away just because the accused is dead,” said Go Mi-kyeong, head of the Korea Women’s Hotline, one of the women’s rights groups where Mr. Park’s secretary sought help after going to the police. “The first step toward restoring the victim’s human rights is to unveil the full truth.” Ms. Go called on the police to disclose what they have learned so far about the case. The police interviewed the victim and her lawyer for almost 10 hours until early Thursday. Ms. Go also demanded that Seoul City Hall launch an investigation on why it had dismissed the secretary’s earlier complaints of sexual harassment. “When she appealed for help with City Hall, officials there just tried to protect the mayor, saying that he would never have done such a thing or that she should dismiss it like a minor mistake,” said Lee Mi-kyeong, head of the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center, another women’s right group. “This is a typical case of sexual violence where the victim faces a tremendous power and is blocked from raising an issue.” Seoul City Hall did not immediately respond to the demand for an investigation. In South Korea, men dominate society’s upper echelons, enforcing a strictly hierarchical code. The culture can make women vulnerable to\u200b sexual\u200b abuse and make it difficult to speak out. As in other countries, the #MeToo movement has rippled across South Korea in recent years. Women have come forward with accusations of sexual abuse against an array of prominent men, including theater directors, politicians, professors, religious leaders and a former coach for the national speedskating team. Many of the accused have apologized and resigned from their positions. Several have faced criminal charges. Mr. Park was by far the most prominent South Korean facing #MeToo accusations. In 2018, he won a record third-term as mayor of Seoul, a city of 10 million where he pushed policies to make it safer for women. As a well-known human rights lawyer, he won the country’s first sexual harassment case. Kim Jae-ryeon, the\u200b secretary’s lawyer, said the \u200bvictim first came to her on May 12, accusing Mr. Park of sexually harassing her in his office and \u200bin a\u200b bedroom attached to it. Mr. Park pressed his body on \u200bher while taking selfies\u200b, the lawyer said during the news conference\u200b. He \u200balso \u200bcalled her into his bedroom and asked her to hug him. Usually late at night, he sent obscene messages and photos of him in underwear through \u200bTelegram, an encrypted messaging app, the lawyer said. “Once, when he saw a bruise on the victim’s knee, he touched his lips \u200bthere, saying that it will heal the wound,” the lawyer said. The lawyer said the victim had told the police that she showed some of Mr. Park’s obscene messages to her friends, as well as a journalist and fellow \u200bCity Hall workers. The secretary also presented the police with incriminating evidence from her smartphone, she said. Mr. Park, now dead, cannot defend himself over these accusations. His family has urged the news media not to carry unconfirmed, one-sided accusations. Amid rain on Monday, hundreds of supporters gathered in front of City Hall, as Mr. Park’s funeral was held inside. \u200bWhen the hearse carried Mr. Park’s body out to be cremated, many supporters wailed \u200band some tried to block the\u200b vehicle. His ashes were later moved to Changnyeong\u200b, his hometown\u200b in southern South Korea, which he left 50 years \u200bago \u200bto pursue one of the most storied political careers in South Korea. Mr. Park’s death divided South Korean society. Many lamented online the premature departure of one of the country’s most talented human rights lawyers, who laid the foundation for the country’s now vibrant civil-society movement. But his detractors called him a “hypocrite.” As political, religious and other leaders\u200b have\u200b paid tribute to him\u200b in the past few days\u200b, some lawmakers and women’s rights leaders have refused to follow suit. In her statement on Monday, \u200bhis secretary expressed condolences over Mr. Park’s death. But she said she felt “stifled” by the way society gave him such a rousing funeral, while she has been subjected to “distortions and speculations” over her motive. “I ask myself how I am going to continue to live,” she said.

Outspoken Chinese Professor Is Said to Be Released From Detention,2020-07-12,By Chris Buckley,"['An outspoken Chinese law professor who has denounced the Communist Party’s harsh policies under Xi Jinping was released from detention on Sunday, a week after the police took him away, two people familiar with the professor said. The professor, Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University in Beijing, has been one of the few Chinese academics willing to openly and bluntly criticize the Chinese government. In two essays this year, he said that official delay and prevarication had stoked the coronavirus outbreak that emerged in China late last year. “When decisions lead to policy failure, not only should the course be corrected, those responsible must acknowledge their mistakes, appeal in all humility for public forgiveness and be held accountable,” Professor Xu wrote in an essay in May, according to a translation by Geremie R. Barmé, an Australian Sinologist. Professor Xu, 57, first attracted widespread notice in 2018 for a long essay that lamented China’s increasingly authoritarian turn under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party leader. Soon after taking power, Mr. Xi launched a drive to discredit liberal ideas such as universal human rights and constitutional limits on party power. Professor Xu was barred from teaching and research by Tsinghua University last year, sharply reducing his income, and he has been warned about his criticisms of the Chinese government. Even so, he has continued to write trenchant essays that have been published abroad, and told friends that he accepted the possibility of detention. The police took Professor Xu from his home in north Beijing on Monday, and friends said that officers accused him of using prostitutes while traveling in southwest China, an accusation the friends called a malicious slur. The detention prompted widespread criticism abroad, including from the Trump administration and the European Union. “We are deeply concerned by the PRC’s detention of Professor Xu Zhangrun for criticizing Chinese leaders amid tightening ideological controls on university campuses in China,” Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said on Twitter, referring to the People’s Republic of China. Two people familiar with the professor and his family said that he returned to his home on Sunday morning. Both people asked that their names not be used, citing fear of recrimination by the Chinese authorities. The police in Changping, the northern district of Beijing where the professor lives, did not confirm his release, just as they did not confirm his detention last week.']","Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing known for criticizing the Communist Party, was allowed to go home after being detained a week ago, people familiar with him said."
"Sudan Will Scrap Alcohol and Apostasy Laws, and End Flogging",2020-07-13,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Sudan will allow non-Muslims to consume alcohol, scrap its apostasy law and abolish the use of public flogging as a punishment as its transitional government eases decades of strict Islamist policies. The moves, announced late Saturday by the justice minister Nasredeen Abdulbari, are part of a slew of changes introduced under the transitional government as it seeks to break with the rule of Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who was deposed last year after more than three decades in power. The government had already moved to ban the genital cutting of women, a measure that is coming into effect now. The latest announcement came a week after tens of thousands of people took to the streets despite a coronavirus lockdown demanding faster reform and greater civilian rule as the nation takes baby steps toward democracy. “As a government, our work is to protect all Sudanese citizens based on the Constitution and based on laws that should be consistent with the Constitution,” Mr. Abdulbari told state television. The laws being scrapped are legacies of both Mr. al-Bashir and Gaafar al-Nimeiry, an army colonel who led Sudan between 1969 and 1985. In 1983, he imposed Islamic law throughout the nation, precipitating the conflict between the Muslim majority north and the mainly Christian and animist south that led to South Sudan’s secession in 2011. After taking power in 1989, Mr. al-Bashir extended Islamic rule and introduced public order laws that criminalized a wide array of activities and behaviors, including drinking alcohol and wearing revealing clothes for women. Those who contravened the rules faced prison sentences, fines and public lashing. Rights organizations said the laws were “oppressive” and gave the authorities extensive powers to make arbitrary arrests, particularly of women. The apostasy rules in particular drew worldwide condemnation after a heavily pregnant woman was sentenced to death in 2014 for renouncing Islam. The woman, Meriam Ibrahim, gave birth while she was in prison and was later released after organizations including Amnesty International campaigned for her release. Mr. Abdulbari said the government had decided to get rid of the apostasy law because it was “a threat to the security and safety of society.” The repeal is “seen as broadening personal freedoms and is a sharp departure from the previous prohibitive regime,” said David Kiwuwa, director of the Center for Advanced International Studies at the University of Nottingham’s campus in Ningbo, China, who described it as “a strong signal” that Sudan was changing under its civilian authorities. After Mr. al-Bashir was toppled in April 2019 following months of protests, his government was replaced by an 11-member sovereign council consisting of six civilians and five military leaders, tasked with preparing the country for elections after a three-year transition period. The council appointed Abdalla Hamdok, an economist who has held several United Nations positions, as prime minister, and his government immediately embarked on an ambitious program as it sought to placate pro-democracy demonstrators and rejoin the international community. As they moved to dissolve the former governing party of Mr. al-Bashir last November, the authorities also overturned a moral policing law that dictated women’s dress, and in April they approved a ban on genital cutting. Mr. Hamdok’s government has also undertaken a political and economic overhaul, revived talks with rebel groups, and begun investigations into the bloody suppression of the Darfur region under Mr. al-Bashir, promising to prosecute and possibly hand over to the International Criminal Court those wanted for war crimes. The administration has also lobbied the United States to drop Sudan from the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that has restricted investment and foreign aid. Yet despite the good will and heady optimism, Sudan’s political transition remains delicate, buffeted by economic headwinds and restrictions necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Hamdok survived an assassination attempt in March, and concerns of a coup have swirled in recent months. In early July, one person was killed and several others were injured at protests in major cities including the capital, Khartoum, demanding the swift delivery of “freedom, peace and justice.” On Sunday, security forces forcibly dispersed a sit-in in Darfur, which some took as an indication that the military retains the balance of real power. Observers said on Monday that the scrapping of the laws should be read within the broader context of Sudan turning a new page and promoting a more inclusive and representative society. But more would need to be done if the government were to change long-held cultural practices, said Ahmed Soliman, a research fellow at the Africa Program at the British foreign-policy research institute Chatham House. “The transitional government has demonstrated its intent to keep equal citizenship at the forefront of the political transition, including by addressing issues of gender and religious freedoms,” Mr. Soliman said, adding: “There is also division about these reforms, with a strong backlash by conservative religious and political figures who see the changes as an attack on Islam and morality.”']",The moves are part of efforts to broaden personal freedoms during a delicate democratic transition.
Bahrain to Execute 2 Shiite Protesters After Years of Desperate Appeals,2020-07-13,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Two Bahraini men who say they were tortured into making false confessions were sentenced to death for the fifth time on Monday in what international rights groups called another stain on Bahrain’s record of imprisoning, torturing and executing government critics. The two men, both members of Bahrain’s Shiite majority, were first arrested and tried for a bombing that killed a police officer in 2014. They faced execution even after a Bahraini internal investigation found medical evidence that one had been tortured. “They’d beat me up. I’d go up again and deny,”  said Husain Moosa, one of the defendants, describing his interrogation to a rights activist in a January recording reviewed by The New York Times. After the third beating by an interrogator, Mr. Moosa recalled, “ I told him, ‘I’ll say what you want. What do you want me to say?’” Bahrain, a tiny island kingdom off the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf, has a majority-Shiite population but is ruled by a Sunni monarchy, leading to occasional protests and violence against government security forces. Since 2011, when it turned to Saudi Arabia to help quash a Shiite revolt, the Bahraini government has prosecuted a growing number of Shiite leaders and activists. The kingdom carried out 10 executions in the six decades before 2017, then six in just the past three years, according to Reprieve, a Britain-based rights group that provides legal support to people facing the death penalty. Reports of detainees tortured into confessing with electric shocks, extreme cold and sexual abuse are common. Bahrain’s government has established two oversight agencies to investigate misconduct allegations against its security forces, funding them with the help of Britain, which has supplied Bahrain’s security and justice system with millions of pounds since 2012. The kingdom is also a longtime ally of the United States and hosts the Navy’s Fifth Fleet. “To Western partners, Bahrain promises human rights reform,” said Maya Foa, Reprieve’s director. “To citizens, it threatens that if you speak out, you will be imprisoned, tortured and convicted of crimes you did not commit.” Mr. Moosa and the other man sentenced on Monday, Mohammed Ramadhan, were arrested in February 2014 after a bomb detonated in the village of Al Dair, near Bahrain’s international airport, while policemen in the area were breaking up a riot, according to prosecutors. One officer was killed, and several others injured. Prosecutors identified Mr. Moosa and Mr. Ramadhan, who faced several terrorism-related charges. Mr. Moosa, 34, a hotel driver, later said that interrogators handcuffed and repeatedly beat him on his back, face and genitals. In pain, he eventually confessed, implicating Mr. Ramadhan, a 37-year-old airport policeman. “The most tormenting thing was being hit on my testicles just to say that it was Mohammed,” Mr. Moosa recounted in the January recording. “They hit me with their shoes, and two people would come and make me lie on the floor and they would touch the testicles. One person would grab my thighs to open my legs completely and the other person would press the testicles.” Mr. Moosa has said his wrists were zip-tied, causing them to swell so much that his interrogators had to hospitalize him. Zahra Moosa, Mr. Moosa’s sister, said that injuries were “obvious on his hands and his back” when she visited him in prison in 2014. “It’s impossible that my brother would do something like killing,” she added. “He’s just a peaceful protester.” Mr. Ramadhan said that during his interrogation, security officials touched his buttocks and forced him to stand for hours in a frigid room. They also threatened to sexually assault his wife and sisters in front of him, he said. A father of three who had previously marched in peaceful pro-democracy protests, Mr. Ramadhan has said his interrogators acknowledged that his political activism made him a target for prosecution. He confessed to protesting, but refused to sign a confession claiming responsibility for the bombing. “They literally told me that they were waiting for a major case to frame me in it,” he told his wife from prison on July 4, according to a recording of the call. “They said they knew about my participation in protests and demonstrations, and that I betrayed the government.” Sentenced to death in December 2014, the men have appealed several times, and each time their convictions have stood. Their one break came when, under international pressure over the case, a Bahraini oversight agency announced that it had found a doctor’s report documenting injuries on Mr. Moosa’s wrists that raised the “suspicion that he was subjected to assault and mistreatment.” That report, the review said, had been overlooked during the initial trial. Based on the internal review, Bahrain’s high court overturned the two men’s death sentences in October 2018, but a lower court reinstated them in January of this year. The high court reaffirmed the verdict on Monday. Bahrain has not announced when the two men will be executed. Once the king signs off, however, execution is imminent. In a statement, an official in Bahrain’s public prosecution office, Haroon Al Zayani, said the convictions were based on victim and witness testimony, physical evidence and technical and forensic reports, none of which he described. He said the evidence also included text messages on the defendants’ phones showing them planning to commit the crimes. The medical reports documenting Mr. Moosa’s injuries are not “in line with the procedures of the police nor the public prosecution” office, Mr. Al Zayani said. He said the confessions were made “with full consciousness and voluntarily, without any physical or verbal coercion,” and that the men were convicted with “all the requirements of a fair trial.” The men’s supporters and rights groups have drawn the opposite conclusion, arguing that Bahrain’s courts have been turned into a tool for the kingdom’s crackdown on political opponents. “I know that no one is listening to me because I do not have much money, I do not have many possessions and I am not famous. However, I want my voice to be heard,” Mr. Ramadhan said in the July call to his wife. “I am innocent of the crime of which I was accused, subjected to a sham trial and sentenced to death.” Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.']",The men were convicted of a bombing that killed a police officer in 2014.

"Hong Kong Voters Defy Beijing, Endorsing Protest Leaders in Primary",2020-07-13,"By Austin Ramzy, Elaine Yu and Tiffany May","['HONG KONG — Defying warnings from local officials that the Hong Kong opposition’s unofficial primary vote could be illegal under a sweeping new security law, hundreds of thousands of people chose avowedly pro-democracy candidates to run in citywide elections this year, results released Monday showed. Early returns showed that the more than 600,000 people who had voted favored candidates who were prominent supporters of the months of demonstrations that have gripped the semiautonomous Chinese city. Their choices indicated a desire to see the goals of the protest movement pressed within the government itself, but could lead to an intensifying confrontation with the authorities, who could bar some from running. “So many people came out to vote despite the threat that it may violate the national security law,” said Lester Shum, a 27-year-old activist and candidate who was among the front-runners on Monday. “That means Hong Kong people have still not given up.” Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement has been hobbled by mass arrests at protests and by the new security law, which bans vaguely defined crimes of secession, subversion and terrorism and is already working to mute dissent. The one remaining avenue of resisting Beijing’s tightening grip over the city, they say, is to capture a majority in the legislature in September. The obstacles are enormous. Hong Kong’s electoral system has long been weighted heavily in favor of the establishment that is backed by the Chinese Communist Party. Pro-Beijing parties are far better funded than the opposition. Now they must contend with the new, far-reaching national security law imposed by the central Chinese government that makes speaking out against the authorities possibly criminal. Opposition candidates, whose calls for democratic freedoms could be deemed as hostile to China’s ruling Communist Party, say they fear that whoever has protested the law could be disqualified from running or jailed. Even if they did succeed in being elected, there was no guarantee that the party would let them govern. Supporters of the democratic camp have been grappling with whether to rely on familiar, moderate politicians or to abandon them in favor of more confrontational candidates — and those disagreements have threatened to divide the vote. The informal primary this past weekend to help determine who should run in September sought to avoid such a split. Among those in the lead were activists such as Joshua Wong, who led the large street demonstrations in 2014 for freer elections, and Ted Hui and Roy Kwong, young lawmakers who often tried to mediate between protesters and the police during last year’s unrest. “They are in favor of electing people who have a strong record in the protest movement so that they can continue the protests” within the legislative body, said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Those who have strong recognition in the protests stand out, irrespective of their parties.” The turnout represented more than half of the opposition’s votes in 2016, and was several times higher than the organizers had expected. Voters went to polling stations set up on sidewalks as well as in unconventional venues such as a lingerie shop and a converted double-decker bus. Joyce Leung, a 35-year-old mother of two young children, said that she had decided to vote for candidates who regularly attended the protests even though they were at risk of exclusion from competing. “I think they will definitely be disqualified,” she said on Sunday, after having cast a vote at a sidewalk polling station on Hong Kong Island surrounded by tenement buildings, office towers and coffee shops. “But I still wanted to show them that a lot of people are supporting them.” Hong Kong’s electoral system has never been equal. Britain had little interest in democracy when it ran the city, and China quickly undermined a pledge that the entire legislature would be elected, by maintaining the British colonial system of limited voting.  Just half of the 70 seats in the legislature represent geographical districts that are directly elected by voters. The other half are so-called functional constituencies, most chosen by corporate voting and more likely to go to establishment candidates. That tilted system has historically discouraged some Hong Kong residents from participating. But in November, after months of fierce and at times violent antigovernment protests, voters turned out in large numbers for an election of Hong Kong’s district councilors, a low-level office that previously drew little attention. More than seven in 10 eligible voters cast ballots, compared to a previous high of 47 percent — and delivered a stunning victory for the pro-democracy camp, which swept 86 percent of the seats. That victory shocked Beijing and emboldened protesters to set their eyes on the more ambitious target of elections for the Legislative Council, a far more powerful body. Their goal has taken on extra urgency as other displays of dissent have become increasingly perilous under the new security law. Sage Ip, a 29-year-old flight attendant who cast her ballot on Sunday in the Sai Ying Pun district, said she voted in the primary because she was worried that she would never get a chance to do so again. “Voting is something that is still within our capacity. We can’t express ourselves at protests anymore.” The police now regularly ban marches, citing violence and coronavirus-prevention measures, and sweep up hundreds of demonstrators in mass arrests. “To cast your vote, you do not need to risk your life,” Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong and leading strategist for the opposition, said in June. “It is a form of protest that actually is risk-less, I would say. So why not? Why not use your vote to buy a chance?” Gwyneth Ho, a 29-year-old former journalist who emerged as a front-runner in her district on Monday, has urged pro-democracy supporters to keep fighting, no matter the odds. “We all know, we do something not because it’s effective, or because it’ll succeed,” she called out to commuters streaming past her outside a busy subway station on a recent Wednesday late last month. “It’s because we can’t give up on any front.” If the pro-democracy candidates were able to capture a majority in the legislature, they could use their position to block the government’s agenda. Some have proposed vetoing the government’s budget, which could force the dissolution of the legislature. If a new legislature were also to block the budget, the chief executive would be forced to step down. Erick Tsang, the constitutional affairs secretary, warned last week that the pro-democracy camp’s primary could potentially be considered subversion under the new national security law if its goal were to form a majority to block the Hong Kong government’s policies. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, repeated Mr. Tsang’s warning on Monday night. Beijing’s representative office in Hong Kong was more strident, declaring in a statement late Monday that the primary was “nakedly illegal behavior” that caused “serious damage to the fairness and justice” of the legislative elections. It singled out Mr. Tai, the opposition strategist, for criticism, accusing him of working at the behest of unnamed forces. “The goal of the Benny Tai gang and the opposition is to seize the power of governance in Hong Kong and deliberately stage the Hong Kong version of the ‘color revolution,’” the office said, referring to anti-Communist uprisings China says are orchestrated by the West. “He was so openly manipulating the election. Whose instructions did he receive? Who gave him such confidence?” The pro-democracy camp’s electoral push also displayed rifts within the opposition movement. A few candidates who champion more aggressive tactics refused to participate in the pro-democracy camp’s primary, arguing that voters should be able to choose from the full range of candidates in September. More moderate voices have argued that voters needed to be strategic rather than ideological, and should rally behind the candidates most likely to win. A significant threat looms over all the pro-democracy camp’s plans: disqualification. In the last legislative election, several candidates were barred from competing over questions of whether they acknowledged Beijing’s position that Hong Kong was an “inalienable part” of China. Six who won later lost their seats because they protested against China during their oaths of office. This year, many in the opposition fear that election officials will also bar candidates who have questioned the new security law. Mr. Shum, who campaigned at the street booth with Ms. Ho, said his ultimate goal was for the pro-democracy camp to win so many seats that Beijing would be forced to take drastic action in response, such as disqualifying all the elected lawmakers. He said he hoped that such extreme action would then provoke an international response in support of the protesters. But others warn that any large-scale rejection of pro-democracy candidates by the government could cause Hong Kong to erupt. “This time around we are talking about the possibility of getting more than half the seats, but I think the reality is we may not be allowed to participate in the election at all,” said Fernando Cheung, a veteran opposition lawmaker who is stepping down this year. “If that is to happen, the anger and the frustration would be extreme,” he said. “I’m afraid the confrontation would be much worse.”']",Voters turned out in high numbers to cast ballots in an unofficial primary for the city’s pro-democracy camp despite government warnings it might be against the new security law.
Poland’s Presidential Election Too Close to Call,2020-07-12,By Monika Pronczuk and Marc Santora,"['WARSAW — Poland’s presidential election, widely viewed as the most important since the end of Communist rule in 1989, failed to produce a clear winner on Sunday night, though final exit polls showed President Andrzej Duda leading the challenger, Rafal Trzaskowski. Mr. Duda, a conservative nationalist, had 51 percent of the votes to 49 percent for Mr. Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, according to the polls, but they are not considered official results and neither candidate conceded the race. That set the stage for an extended fight over the results of Europe’s first presidential election since the coronavirus swept across the continent. The pandemic forced the government to reluctantly move the date of the election from May, giving time for Mr. Trzaskowski to enter the race. In the first round in June, no candidate emerged with more than 50 percent of the vote, setting up a runoff between the top two finishers. Over the past two weeks, an already bitter contest turned even darker, as Mr. Duda’s campaign leaned heavily on stoking fear of gay people and the free press, and began making arguments tinged with anti-Semitism. The government has until Tuesday night to declare a winner. A close race will involve counting both in-person and mail-in votes, as well as record numbers of voters registered abroad. The turnout appears to have been the highest since the first, partially free elections were held in the country in 1989. Despite the uncertainty, Mr. Duda rushed to claim victory. “It is a privilege to have won with a 70 percent turnout,” he said to supporters in the town of Pultusk, about 40 miles from Warsaw. But even as he spoke, Polish television was showing people still in line to vote in several locations. Mr. Trzaskowski sounded equally confident that he would emerge the winner. “We said it would be close and it is close,” he told supporters in Warsaw. “But I am absolutely convinced that we are going to win. It is just about counting the votes. I am sure that when we count the votes one by one, we will win for sure.” Mr. Duda’s re-election would ensure that the governing Law and Justice party, which also controls the Parliament, would be able to continue to reshape the nation in ways that critics contend undermine open political debate and the rule of law. The government has corralled independent courts and media, clashing with the European Union, which has accused Poland of damaging democratic values and institutions. Mr. Trzaskowski had cast the election as a fight for the soul of the nation, to end a government that uses state media for propaganda, silences opposing voices, uses fear and division to build support and antagonizes Europe. He said he wanted to live in a country where “an open hand wins against a clenched fist.” Last week, the government accused Germany of fomenting discord through media outlets widely viewed as independent but owned by German companies. Mr. Duda’s allies even accused Mr. Trzaskowski of supporting pedophilia and suggested that Mr. Trzaskowski would be controlled by Jewish interests — a fraught topic in a country that was at the epicenter of the Holocaust. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of Law and Justice and the most powerful politician in Poland, accused Mr. Trzaskowski of not having a “Polish soul” or “Polish heart,” for saying that restitution of Jewish property lost during World War II was up for discussion. “All of us in Poland have Polish hearts and Polish souls and we will not allow ourselves to be divided,” Mr. Trzaskowski said in response, adding that Mr. Duda needed to divide Poles to secure support. “We will not allow ourselves to be attacked and we will say it loud and clear,” he said. “We’ve had enough of hatred.” The main target of Mr. Duda’s campaign has been the L.G.B.T. community, the focus of attacks by leading government figures for more than a year now. Last week, Mr. Duda signed a draft amendment to the constitution that would explicitly ban gay adoption, justifying it with the “well-being and security” of children. Mr. Kaczynski, has called the gay rights movement a foreign import that threatens the nation’s identity. In conservative areas, town councils have been declaring their municipalities “L.G.B.T. free.” As mayor of Warsaw, Mr. Trzaskowski pushed back. He issued a rights declaration setting out the city’s commitment to try to help find shelter for gay youths rejected by their parents. He also promised to incorporate World Health Organization guidelines on sex and tolerance education into Warsaw’s school system. Last year, when Pride marchers faced violence from far-right groups across the country, he joined a parade in Warsaw. Mr. Trzaskowski has vowed to keep generous social programs created by Law and Justice, making them a less potent campaign issue. Instead, the contest was fought over cultural issues and Poland’s place both in Europe and the world. Mr. Trzaskowski has promised to repair the rifts with the European Union, whereas Mr. Duda has touted his close relationship with the Trump administration while attacking the bloc. The incumbent received a boost recently from President Trump, who met with him at the White House and all but endorsed Mr. Duda, saying: “He’s doing a terrific job. The people of Poland think the world of him.”']",President Andrzej Duda leads a conservative government that has fought to control courts and the news media while stoking fear of gay people and foreigners.

"To ‘Protect Young Minds,’ Hong Kong Moves to Overhaul Schools",2020-07-11,By Amy Qin and Tiffany May,"['Starting this fall, schools in Hong Kong will display colorful new government-issued posters declaring that “freedom comes with responsibilities.” Administrators may now call the police if anyone insults the Chinese national anthem on campus.  Students as young as kindergartners will be taught about a new national security law that gives the authorities the power to squelch opposition to Beijing with heavy prison sentences. After months of antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, China’s ruling Communist Party is reaching into the semiautonomous territory to overhaul an education system that it sees as having given rise to a generation of rebellious youth. The sweeping law Beijing imposed earlier this month also targets Hong Kong’s students, who have been a galvanizing force behind the protests. Carrie Lam, the city’s Beijing-backed leader, said at a forum on Saturday that the arrests of more than 3,000 children and teenagers at protests had exposed how the city’s campuses had been penetrated by forces hostile to the local and central governments. “Faced with such a severe situation with our young people, we can’t help but ask, what is wrong with education in Hong Kong?” she said. Mrs. Lam said the schools’ textbooks, classroom teaching and students’ extracurricular activities reflected negative news media reporting about China and the “wanton discrediting of the government and police.” Educating students about the new law, she said, would help them become more law-abiding.  The party’s goal for the territory is clear: to foster a new generation of loyal and patriotic Hong Kong youth. It is a strategy of ideological control that it has wielded to great effect in the mainland, but could rapidly erode Hong Kong’s reputation for academic freedom. “Young kids will be brought up to understand and believe that without the Chinese Communist Party they have no future, that anything they have is because of the party,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Over the last year, images of students in neatly pressed school uniforms joining hands to form human chains have become among the most evocative symbols of the protest movement. But campuses have also been the site of some of the movement’s most violent scenes, such as at Polytechnic University, where protesters and police officers faced off in a prolonged fight with rubber bullets, firebombs and bows and arrows in November. Now, in forcing through the security law, Beijing has signaled that it has seen enough. On Wednesday, Kevin Yeung, Hong Kong’s education secretary, barred students from singing “Glory to Hong Kong,” a popular protest song, displaying political slogans or forming human chains on campus. Defenders of the law have argued that the city’s academic freedom would remain untouched. But, they say, students and teachers should know that freedom of speech comes with limitations. “You can’t just allow teachers to talk, and impose their views, free for all,” said Regina Ip, a cabinet member who leads a pro-Beijing party in the legislature. “Critical thinking does not mean training people to criticize or attack.” Even before the law was enacted, the transformation of Hong Kong’s education system was already underway. The new school year had just started in September when Law Pei-lee, a teacher at a girls’ school, learned that a parent had filed a complaint about her conduct. She was accused of discussing the case of Lam Wing-kee, a local bookstore owner who was kidnapped by Chinese security officials in 2015. Ms. Law, a veteran teacher, said she had mentioned the incident in passing. But she said the education bureau repeatedly demanded an explanation. Though she was never officially punished, she said the monthslong investigation felt like “psychological torture.” Worse, Ms. Law said, she feared the law would stifle young minds. “Will our kids be able to think critically when they grow up?” Both the education bureau and an employee at Ms. Law’s school, Sacred Heart Canossian School Private Section, said they could not comment on individual cases. Some teachers and students say the investigations have created a climate of fear on campuses. A recent survey of more than 1,100 teachers found that around a third had been told by a supervisor to avoid discussing politics.  Some parents say they are only trying to keep their children out of harm’s way. “What are the teachers afraid of?” said Ho Chiu Fai, a father of a fifth-grader and founder of Help Our Next Generation, a group of volunteers who investigate complaints against teachers. “We are all very worried that our kids will do something illegal, like go to illegal protests.” Mr. Yeung, the education secretary, has vowed to “ferret out” problematic teachers. Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong’s former top leader, has set up a fund to help investigate teachers. “The Government have a duty to protect young minds from radicalization,” Mr. Leung wrote in an email. Some teachers have lost their jobs for not taking a harder line against protest-related actions in school. Lee Kwan-pui, a music teacher at Heung To Middle School, was fired in May after she let her students play “Glory to Hong Kong,” according to local media reports. Ms. Lee defended herself in an email she sent to the school’s staff and students, seen by The New York Times, saying she had reminded students to avoid social topics when choosing songs, but that ultimately it was their decision. “I never brought up my political stance to students on campus,” she wrote. After Ms. Lee’s firing, students formed human chains at the school in protest. Reached by telephone, an administrative employee at the school declined to comment. The new national security law — which authorizes life imprisonment for secession, terrorism and other political offenses in the most serious cases — could make navigating classroom discussions even more difficult for teachers. Liberal Studies, a mandatory civics course that has been blamed by some officials for radicalizing students, will likely come under much greater scrutiny. Chinese history has become a mandatory subject in middle schools, and some teachers have asked how they should discuss contentious events under the party’s rule. Schools must review their library catalogs to remove books that “provoke any acts or activities which endanger national security,” the bureau said in a statement to The Times. The law is already having a deterrent effect. At Ying Wa College, an elite boys’ school, a group of students who only last month chanted pro-independence slogans on the school’s sports field has now quickly disbanded and taken down its social media account. Beijing’s broader push for control over the city’s schools and its sweeping interpretation of national security also raises questions about the future of Hong Kong’s status as a hub for higher education in the region. The uncertainty over the law is driving concerns that scholars may be forced to censor themselves. Others fear that the vaguely defined crime of collusion could be applied to international academic collaborations. Bruce Lui, a senior lecturer in journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University, pointed out the many topics that are covered by mainland China’s own national security law, ranging from the economy to outer space and, lately, biosecurity. Could researchers in Hong Kong, he asked, be punished for publishing data on the origins of the new coronavirus if their findings implicated China? Some administrators are striking a defiant note. Kellee Tsai, the dean of the school of humanities and social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, encouraged her department to carry on their teaching and research as usual until further instructions were issued. “There may well be non-obvious ‘red lines’ in Hong Kong’s higher education sector that cannot be crossed without severe legal consequences,” she told them in an email seen by The Times. “Let’s not draw those lines ourselves.” Bella Huang contributed reporting.']",China’s leaders have pushed the territory to revamp an education system they see as having bred young rebels who have helped drive pro-democracy protests.
White Supremacist Who Admitted Christchurch Killings Plans to Represent Himself,2020-07-13,By Isabella Kwai,"['An Australian white supremacist who pleaded guilty to killing 51 worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand last year plans to represent himself at a sentencing hearing in August, a court heard on Monday, raising concerns that he might use the proceedings to push his views and traumatize the survivors once again. The white supremacist, Brenton Tarrant, initially denied involvement before pleading guilty in March to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism for the killing spree in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. The massacre, the deadliest shooting in New Zealand’s history, led the government to ban most semiautomatic weapons and spurred an effort to restrict racist and violent content on the internet. The gunman had posted a white-supremacist manifesto online and live-streamed part of the shootings on Facebook. On Monday, a judge at Christchurch’s High Court confirmed that Mr. Tarrant, who appeared via video link from Auckland Prison, had waived his rights to legal representation before allowing his lawyers, Jonathan Hudson and Shane Tait, to withdraw from the case, according to the local news media. “We are not disappointed by Mr. Tarrant’s decision,” Mr. Hudson said, according to The New Zealand Herald. “There has been no conflict or relationship breakdown.”  Instead, the court will appoint a lawyer on standby should Mr. Tarrant choose to be represented later. By representing himself, Mr. Tarrant will be entitled to speak at the sentencing, although the judge has the power to determine what is relevant to the hearing, Len Andersen, the president of the New Zealand Criminal Bar Association, told the local news outlet Stuff. But that would most likely not include any attempt to share white-supremacist views. “Since he has accepted he is a terrorist and there is no difference for sentencing purposes what his ideology is, I expect the judge will say any such comments are irrelevant and stop him,” said Kris Gledhill, a professor of law at Auckland University of Technology. Mr. Tarrant’s sentencing has been set for Aug. 24, with the hearing expected to last several days as victims who survived the shooting and relatives of those killed give impact statements. The victims’ families and members of the Muslim community said that Mr. Tarrant’s move was an attempt to grab attention and could retraumatize them if he spoke during an event widely seen as a chance for them to find closure. “The whole sentencing isn’t about him; it’s about the impact on the community,” Anjum Rahman, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women’s Council in New Zealand, told Stuff. “Why give him airtime?” Another man sentenced last month for storming a mosque in Norway said he had been inspired by Mr. Tarrant’s hate-filled manifesto. With travel bans still in place because of the coronavirus pandemic, the government also said on Friday that it would grant exceptions to allow victims of the mosque attacks and their families who are overseas to attend the sentencing, and work to provide technology options for others to read victim-impact statements remotely.']",There is concern that the Australian who pleaded guilty to killing 51 worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand last year would use the occasion to spout his views.
"A Record 5.4 Million Americans Have Lost Health Insurance, Study Finds",2020-07-13,,"['This briefing has ended. Read live coronavirus updates here. The coronavirus pandemic stripped an estimated 5.4 million Americans of their health insurance between February and May, a stretch in which more adults became uninsured because of job losses than have ever lost coverage in a single year, according to a new analysis. As Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports, the study, to be released Tuesday by the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families U.S.A., found that the estimated increase in uninsured laid-off workers over the three-month period was nearly 40 percent higher than the highest previous increase, which occurred during the recession of 2008 and 2009. In that period, 3.9 million adults lost insurance. “We knew these numbers would be big,’’ said Stan Dorn, who directs the group’s National Center for Coverage Innovation and was the author of the study. “This is the worst economic downturn since World War II. It dwarfs the Great Recession. So it’s not surprising that we would also see the worst increase in the uninsured.” The findings are certain to fuel the debate in Congress over the next round of virus relief. The study is a state-by-state examination of the effects of the pandemic on laid-off adults younger than 65, the age at which Americans become eligible for Medicare. It found that nearly half — 46 percent — of the coverage losses from the pandemic came in five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, and North Carolina. In Texas alone, the number of uninsured jumped from about 4.2 million to nearly 4.9 million, the research found, leaving three out of every 10 Texans uninsured. In the 37 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, 23 percent of laid off workers became uninsured. The percentage was nearly double that — 43 percent — in the 13 states that did not expand Medicaid, which include Texas, Florida and North Carolina. The study comes in the thick of the campaign season, when health care — and in particular the Affordable Care Act — is expected to be a major issue. Democrats and their presumptive presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., are seeking to expand the law, former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. But President Trump and Republicans have pressed to repeal it, and the administration has asked the Supreme Court to overturn it.  Definitive data on loss of coverage will not be available until mid- to late-2021, when the federal government publishes health insurance estimates for 2020. “But,” Mr. Dorn said, “policymakers need to know now what the approximate magnitude is of insurance losses to decide what they need to do. So this is our best estimate for what the actual coverage losses have been.” Florida’s governor gave a measured assessment of his state’s battle with the virus on Monday, saying that the case numbers were still high but that there were signs of stabilization. “We have a long road ahead,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Deaths in Florida are trending upward and are at their highest seven-day average level of the pandemic. Florida added more cases on Sunday than any state had recorded — 15,300 — and on Monday it reported more than 12,600 additional cases, its second-highest total recorded for a single day. Even as the governor appeared to be at pains not to sound too upbeat, health experts in the state painted a much more dire picture. Carlos Migoya, the chief executive of Jackson Health Systems, which runs Jackson Memorial, one of the hardest-hit hospitals from the coronavirus, said 200 people were hospitalized three weeks ago. Now, there are more than 400 patients, 100 of them in intensive care. The hospital is facing shortages in medical staff, personal protective gear and the reagents used to test for the virus. Mr. Migoya said that the hospital was now seeing older patients come in. “That means that the younger people have been contaminating the older people,” he said. Despite the surge in cases, Governor DeSantis remains opposed to a statewide mask mandate. “It’s also important to listen and follow the guidance that is put out by local officials,” he said. The state has been trying to bring the positivity rate of people who are tested for the virus below 10 percent. The Florida Department of Health said that as of July 11, the rate statewide was 11.25 percent. But the mayor of Miami, Carlos A. Gimenez, said the rate in Miami-Dade now exceeded 25 percent. “There’s no bogeyman — it’s us,” he said. “Unless we change behavior, we can get all the testing you want, we can get all the contact tracing you want, and it’s not going to make a difference.” As the virus surges in Florida, more big-name Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach to the Republican National Convention, or deciding to skip it altogether. The G.O.P., which moved the convention to Jacksonville from Charlotte, N.C., after balking at health precautions there, now finds itself locked into a state with a far bigger virus problem, and planning an event whose attendance is waning as the pandemic escalates. President Trump, in the meantime, may not get the restriction-free celebration he yearns for after all. The city of Jacksonville is requiring facial coverings in any public space where social distancing is not possible. And in a news release last week, the host committee said every attendee within the convention perimeter “will be tested and temperature checked each day.” Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Francis Rooney of Florida have no plans to attend. Even Marco Rubio, Florida’s senior senator, has not committed to attending. With coronavirus cases surging in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced one of the most sweeping rollbacks of any state’s reopening plans, saying Monday that he would move to close indoor operations statewide for restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, zoos and card rooms. Bars would be forced to close all operations. And the governor said that in at least 30 of the hardest-hit counties, businesses would be forced to close indoor operations for fitness centers, places of worship, noncritical offices, hair salons and barbershops, and malls. Roughly 80 percent of the state’s population lives in the affected counties, he said. California was averaging more than 8,000 new cases a day as of Sunday, more than double what it was a month ago. The state has seen 331,626 cases, the second highest tally in the nation, and more than 7,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database. “We’re going back into modification mode of our original stay at home order,” Mr. Newsom said. “This continues to be a deadly disease.” Mr. Newsom emphasized that state officials have repeatedly said the state’s reopening process would be more akin to a “dimmer switch” than an on or off switch. In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said Monday that she would ban indoor gatherings of more than 10 people for things like birthday parties, potlucks, book clubs and dinner gatherings. She said the new ban would not apply to the operations of businesses or churches “at this time.” Mr. Newsom made the announcement after California’s two largest public school districts said Monday that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that increasing cases in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. The Los Angeles and San Diego unified school districts, which together enroll some 825,000 students, are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. More than a third of California’s cases are in Los Angeles County and San Diego County has had 18 community outbreaks over the past week, more than double the state’s acceptable threshold. The joint announcement came as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to press the Trump administration’s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students’ social and emotional development, but so that parents can return to work fully. At the White House, Mr. Trump denounced the decision in Los Angeles, arguing that schools should resume because children wanted to attend. “Schools should be opened,” Mr. Trump said. “You’re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed.” It was not clear what he meant, since public health experts say the virus spreads quickly in poorly ventilated, closed areas, the condition of many American schools. The recommendations from the president and Ms. DeVos have been disputed by many public health officials and teachers. On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association, issued a statement saying that reopening recommendations should be “based on evidence, not politics.” The groups added that “we should leave it to health experts to tell us when the time is best to open up school buildings, and listen to educators and administrators to shape how we do it.” In the Los Angeles and San Diego districts’ joint statement, they noted that while much has been learned about the virus, many recommendations and findings are vague and contradictory. But “one fact is clear,” the statement said. “Those countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. California has neither. The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.” The coronavirus struck Oregon early, with cases emerging in February. But unlike two of its neighboring states, Washington and California, Oregon was not quickly overwhelmed by the pandemic. The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, far fewer than most of its neighbors. But as the state reopens after an early lockdown, cases are spiking. The state set a record on Thursday with 389 new infections. If the spread of the virus continues at its current rate, Oregon Health Authority models predict that Portland hospitals will hit capacity in a month, and hospitals throughout the state will be overwhelmed within 90 days. Oregon’s governor says geography helps explain the problem. “We’re sandwiched between California and Washington,” Gov. Kate Brown said. “We’re not an island, and the virus knows absolutely no jurisdictional boundaries.” In rural parts of the state — where the increase has been most drastic — outbreaks have been spurred by large gatherings at churches, food-processing facilities, funerals and graduation parties. Recent gatherings to celebrate the Fourth of July have added to challenge, officials said. “Our biggest concerns are these household and backyard gatherings where people are getting together with a bunch of other households,” said Dr. Paul Cieslak, a state epidemiologist and a senior health adviser for the Oregon Health Authority. As serious as the recent caseload has been, many fear that the upcoming harvest season could make things even worse, as additional agricultural workers pour in and processing plants kick into high gear. U.S. Roundup As Texas faces one of the sharpest increases of new infections in the country, a top medical adviser to Gov. Greg Abbott said the state may need to roll back its reopening and reinstitute an economic lockdown if cases continue to spike. The statements by Dr. Mark McClellan, a physician and an economist at Duke University who is a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, came as more than three dozen states saw increases in infections after loosening health and safety restrictions in order to restart their economies. When Texas started reopening on May 1, more than 29,000 Texans had been infected and more than 800 had died. Two months later, on Monday, there have been more than 265,000 infections and more than 3,200 deaths. Dr. McClellan said in an interview that a lockdown in Texas was a “real possibility” that Governor Abbott may be forced to impose in the next few weeks. “I don’t think we have much time, before having to go to a more extreme step,” Dr. McClellan said. Sylvester Turner, the mayor of Houston, said on Monday he asked the governor to impose a shutdown for a “minimum of two weeks” to prevent the further spread of the disease. “If we can not have a shut down, then at least step back to state’s Phase I,” Mayor Turner wrote on Twitter. The rapid spread has already forced the governor to reverse course by temporarily pausing the reopening, closing bars again and issuing a mask order for most Texans. The governor has suggested in recent television interviews that putting the state back under a lockdown was an option. For most of April, a statewide stay-at-home order slowed the Texas economy, closing many businesses while helping to keep the number of cases relatively low compared to other states. But since the governor decided to reopen restaurants and other businesses in phases in May, Texas has become one of the nation’s coronavirus hot spots. “The virus is out there in our communities all over Texas,” said Dr. McClellan, one of four public-health experts advising the governor during the pandemic. “Maybe there are a few small exceptions, but not really anymore.” Here’s what else is happening around the U.S.: Los Angeles Apparel, which was one of the first clothing retailers to help produce much-needed masks when they were in short supply, was ordered closed on July 10 by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health after more than 300 confirmed infections and four deaths among its garment workers. KFC, the fried chicken chain, closed dining rooms in all 40 of its corporate-owned restaurants in Florida on Monday as virus cases in the state continued to skyrocket. The company encouraged franchisees operating stores in Florida and other virus “hot spot states” such as Arizona, California and Texas to follow suit.  Tennessee recorded more than 2,500 new cases Monday for a single-day record. In Washington State, more than 1,080 cases were announced, also a record. Kansas officials announced more than 880 new cases on Monday, the highest single-day total in that state. Because Kansas’s health department updates statewide only data three times weekly, the most infrequent reporting schedule in the country, its daily totals vary widely. The United States health departments track the virus’s spread with a distinctly American patchwork: a reporting system in which some test results arrive via smooth data feeds but others come by phone, email, physical mail or even fax machines. Wall Street was turbulent, with stocks reversing an early gain that had briefly lifted the S&P 500 back into positive territory for the year. The index was nearly 1 percent lower by the end of the day, after earlier having climbed more than 1.5 percent. The unsteady trading came as the number of virus cases continued to rise, and California moved to close more businesses. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Monday, seeking to block a new rule that would revoke the visas of foreign students who take classes entirely online in the fall. The rule, issued a week ago, would upend months of careful planning by colleges and universities, the lawsuit says, and could force many students to return to their home countries during the pandemic, where their ability to study would be severely compromised. “The Trump administration didn’t even attempt to explain the basis for this senseless rule, which forces schools to choose between keeping their international students enrolled and protecting the health and safety of their campuses,” Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement announcing the suit, which accuses the administration of violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The action, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, is the latest legal effort to contest the federal edict, which has been described by states and universities in court filings as a politically motivated attempt by the Trump administration to force universities to hold in-person classes this fall, even as many have announced they will remain largely online because of health concerns. California filed its own lawsuit last week, after Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had already gone to court seeking to block the new rule. Arguments in the Harvard and M.I.T. case are scheduled to be heard on Tuesday, also in the district court in Boston. The federal guidance issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which says foreign students earning their degrees entirely online cannot stay in the United States, has sent students scrambling to enroll in in-person classes that are difficult to find. Many universities are planning to offer a mix of online and in-person classes to protect the health of faculty, students and their surrounding communities during the pandemic. The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, defended the administration’s actions at a news conference early last week. “You don’t get a visa for taking online classes from, let’s say, University of Phoenix. So why would you if you were just taking online classes, generally?” she told reporters, adding, “Perhaps the better lawsuit would be coming from students who have to pay full tuition with no access to in-person classes to attend.” The area represented by the 17 states and the District of Columbia contains 1,124 colleges and universities that had a combined 373,000 international students enrolled in 2019, who contributed an estimated $14 billion to the economy that year, according to the complaint. About 40 higher education institutions filed declarations in support of the lawsuit, including Yale, DePaul, the University of Chicago, Tufts, Rutgers and state universities in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, was back at the White House on Monday meeting with Mark Meadows, the chief of staff — but not Mr. Trump — after a weekend in which some of the president’s advisers undercut him in the press. Dr. Fauci — who has not had direct contact with the president in more than five weeks even as the number of Americans with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has risen sharply in the Southwest — slipped back into the West Wing to meet with Mr. Meadows, while his allies denounced what they called a meanspirited and misguided effort by the White House to smear him. White House officials declined to comment on what was discussed in the conversation between Mr. Meadows, who has long expressed skepticism about the conclusions of the nation’s public health experts, and Dr. Fauci, though one official called it a good conversation and said they continued to have a positive relationship. Mr. Trump made no effort to sugarcoat his rift with Dr. Fauci, declining to repudiate the criticism of him from his staff and saying that “I don’t always agree with him.” But the president also implicitly acknowledged how unlikely he was to get rid of Dr. Fauci, calling him “a very nice person” and saying that “I like him personally.” Dr. Fauci, for his part, continued to issue warnings about the virus. “We haven’t even begun to see the end of it yet,” he said in an interview Monday with Lloyd B. Minor, the dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine. He noted that the nation had “plateaued at a level that was really quite high, about 20,000 infections a day” when many states began to ease restrictions. “Then, as we started to reopen, we’re seeing the surges that we’re seeing today, as we speak,” he said. Dr. Fauci spent the early days of the pandemic as the leading scientific voice in the federal government’s response before falling out of favor with Mr. Trump and his top aides over blunt comments inconsistent with the president’s message of economic resurgence. In task force meetings, Dr. Fauci has often styled himself as a solitary pessimist in a room where some officials have been eager to wave away the alarming trajectory of the coronavirus. He has grown increasingly vocal in his concerns about the national surge in cases and offered a far darker perspective on the virus than the one the president routinely gives. Over the weekend, aides to Mr. Trump released to The Washington Post and other news outlets a list of remarks Dr. Fauci made about the virus when it was in its early stages. It featured several comments White House aides had privately complained about for months. A poll conducted for The New York Times by Siena College last month showed that 67 percent of Americans trusted Dr. Fauci when it came to the virus; only 26 percent trusted the president. He had a coffee cup in one hand, a smart phone in the other, and a pair of glasses resting on his stomach. What wasn’t seen in the picture of Ted Cruz, Senator of Texas, that circulated widely on social media in recent days, was his face mask. The picture of Senator Cruz sitting in an airplane seat, was posted on Twitter on Sunday night by an employee of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Another photo shows Mr. Cruz, a Republican from Texas, sitting outside the flight’s gate, also without a mask. Another photo shared on a different Twitter account on Monday appears to show Mr. Cruz wearing a red, black and white mask on a flight. A spokesperson for American Airlines confirmed that Mr. Cruz had flown with one of its domestic regional partners on Sunday and said that the company had reviewed the incident. “As we do in all instances like these, we reviewed the details of the matter,” the spokesperson wrote in an email on Monday afternoon. “And while our policy does not apply while eating or drinking, we have reached out to Senator Cruz to affirm the importance of this policy as part of our commitment to protecting the health and safety of the traveling public.” American Airlines announced in mid-June that it would require passengers to wear face coverings while on board its planes and that it would deny boarding to passengers who refused to comply. The policy allows face coverings to be removed while eating or drinking. A representative from Mr. Cruz’s office said that the senator wore a face covering when traveling and that he had temporarily removed his mask to eat or drink when he was photographed without one. “Senator Cruz has repeatedly said since the start of the pandemic we need to follow the science, listen to public health experts and take common sense steps to slow the spread of Covid-19 and reopen our economy,” the spokeswoman said in an email. “That includes wearing face masks, washing hands and social distancing where possible.” Hosseh Enad, who shared the photos of Mr. Cruz without a mask, later wrote that the photos were taken by a mutual friend. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Hong Kong, a city that weeks ago seemed like one of the most successful places in controlling the virus, announced Monday evening that it would close gyms and cinemas and ban public gatherings of more than four people in response to a new wave of locally transmitted infections. Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive, announced a series of measures to take effect on Wednesday. Also included were a prohibition on all dining inside restaurants every evening from 6 p.m., and a requirement that everyone taking public transportation wear a mask. The Walt Disney Company said on Monday that Hong Kong Disneyland would also close again to comply with the new government order. Health officials said that the territory’s new spate of cases, including another 52 announced on Monday, was mainly connected to taxi drivers, restaurants and nursing homes. The prohibition on public gatherings of four or more people could make it even harder for the pro-democracy opposition to organize any protests against a stringent national security law imposed on June 30 by Beijing. The ban could also interfere with an election campaign now underway to choose a new legislature on Sept. 6. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, has a robust contact-tracing system that helped the authorities contain an initial outbreak last winter. The city won praise from international health experts in the pandemic’s early days. In response to a second wave of infections imported in March from Europe and the United States, Hong Kong closed its borders to nonresidents and mandated quarantine for returning residents. Under the new regulations issued on Monday, travelers to Hong Kong will be required to provide proof that they tested negative before boarding flights to the city. The 52 new cases on Monday continued a weeklong spike, labeled a third wave by health officials, after months in which few or no new daily infections were detected. The authorities said they were unable to trace the infection pattern in 20 of the new cases disclosed on Monday. That raises the prospect that the virus is circulating silently in the community, after months in which local transmission appeared to have been at a standstill. New York ROUNDUP New York is tightening its restrictions on travelers from designated states with high infection rates. Those travelers, who were already required to quarantine for 14 days, must now provide contact information and details on their planned whereabouts to local authorities upon their arrival at airports across the state starting Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday. The stepped-up enforcement measures are being done in an attempt to keep the outbreaks raging in other states from seeding new infections in New York. The quarantine requirement in New York applies to travelers arriving from 19 states, including Florida, Texas and California. Almost 40 states are seeing cases rise across the country. Mr. Cuomo, who announced the new rule at a briefing Monday, said that forms to collect information from travelers would be distributed on airplanes and could also be filled out electronically. If travelers do not fill them out before leaving the airport, they can be given a summons and fined up to $2,000, he said. They can also be taken before a hearing and ordered to complete the quarantine. At airports run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, teams made up of agency police officers and state employees will meet disembarking passengers at gates to confirm that passengers completed the state Health Department form. Regional airports will handle enforcement at gates at their facilities, too. He added that all travelers from designated states who arrive by other forms of transportation, including cars and trains, must also fill out the form online. Mr. Cuomo said a recent outbreak in Rensselaer County originated with three residents who traveled to Georgia and back and who did not report their arrival in New York. Two of those people worked in nursing homes, he said. “We can’t be in a situation where people are coming from other states in the country and bringing the virus again,” he said. Elsewhere in New York: New York will use a formula to determine whether schools in different regions of the state can open come September, the governor said Monday. Schools will be allowed to reopen if a region of the state has a daily infection rate below 5 percent over a two-week average, and if that region has reached the least restrictive reopening phase. Schools will not reopen, or will be closed, if a region has an infection rate over 9 percent over a one-week average. The state would make a decision about whether schools can reopen during the first week of August. New York City’s mayor has already announced that city schools will reopen in September using staggered schedules. If the governor determines in August that is not yet safe to reopen, that plan will not go into effect. On Monday, the state Education Department released broad guidelines for how schools should reopen safely. New York City’s mayor said on Monday that the infection rate was rising for younger adults, especially those between 20 and 29 years of age. Across the country, younger people have been driving surges in new cases in recent weeks, prompting alarmed public officials to call for masks and social distancing. “We see a problem and we need to address it,” the mayor said, adding that the city would ramp up its outreach to young adults. GLOBAL ROUNDUP Mexico surpassed Italy in virus deaths on Sunday, becoming the country with the fourth-highest number of fatalities from the virus after the United States, Brazil and the United Kingdom. More than 35,000 Mexicans have died in the pandemic, and the country has nearly 300,000 confirmed cases, according to a Times database. And the death toll in Latin America’s second-most-populous nation is probably much worse than official statistics suggest. The bleak milestone underscored government missteps in containing a pandemic that has overwhelmed hospitals, with basic supplies running low and medical professionals falling ill at alarming rates. Just a few months ago, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was gathering crowds of supporters, kissing babies and urging people to hug each other because “nothing’s going to happen.” The country was slow to impose social-distancing measures and temporarily close businesses, and the government has repeatedly changed its projection of when the virus might peak. It now says infections will continue at least through the fall. Despite this, many parts of the country have moved forward with plans to reopen businesses, including factories, restaurants and hotels. Hugo López-Gatell, the health official who has become the public face of the country’s response to the pandemic, said last week that “the epidemic is decelerating.” He said that new cases have been growing at a slower rate and that the return to public life across the country has not resulted in an uptick in outbreaks. In other developments around the world: The World Health Organization admonished governments on Monday that it said are sending mixed messages to citizens, and for failing to invest in the hard work necessary to combat the pandemic. “Let me be blunt,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director general. “Too many countries are headed in the wrong direction. The virus remains public enemy No. 1, but the actions of many governments and people don’t reflect this.” He added, “Mixed messages from leaders are undermining the most critical ingredient of any response: trust.” Amnesty International has called for an inquiry into the British government after Britain recorded one of the largest numbers of coronavirus-related deaths among health care workers, according to a report published by the organization on Monday. More than 3,000 health workers around the world have died after contracting the virus, Amnesty International said. Of those, 540 have been in Britain, which was second only to Russia, where 545 health workers have died. The figure is 507 in the United States. Australian citizens and residents returning from overseas to New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, will be charged for their mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine starting Saturday, the state premier said. Mandatory hotel quarantines at a similar cost are already in effect in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and other parts of the country are likely to begin charging travelers as well amid a new outbreak in Melbourne, Australia’s second-biggest city. The border has been closed to nonresidents since March. The leader of Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia, Quim Torra, said on Monday that his government would proceed with a regional lockdown, a day after a judge ruled that such a measure was only valid if approved by the country’s central government. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa reinstated a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in an effort to alleviate pressure on the health care system. The government also reintroduced an overnight curfew. South Africa has seen a surge in cases as the country enters its coldest month, with more than 264,000 known cases, and nearly 4,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database. Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing who had criticized the Chinese government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, was released from detention on Sunday, a week after the police took him away. On Monday, an organization in France comprising doctors and virus victims has appealed to the country’s highest administrative court to impose the wearing of masks, adding that it was “urgent to take all possible measures to prevent the second wave” of infections. Prime Minister Jean Castex said that he was considering the compulsory wearing of masks to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic and called on people to stay vigilant.

"After Tight Race for Polish President, Andrzej Duda Wins 2nd Term",2020-07-13,By Monika Pronczuk and Marc Santora,"['WARSAW — President Andrzej Duda of Poland was narrowly elected to a second term after the votes were counted on Monday following the country’s closest presidential election since the end of communist rule in 1989, clearing a potential obstacle for the conservative nationalist government. Mr. Duda and the governing party have fought to control the courts and media, while stoking fear of gay people, the European Union and foreigners. For many in the opposition, the race was not only a contest between competing visions for Poland, but a last chance to save institutions that form the bedrock of a healthy democracy. While the tight vote underscored the extent to which the deep divisions in Poland have only intensified after five years governed by the Law and Justice party, there was no suggestion the government would now change course. Mr. Duda’s promise to protect “traditional families” resonated with older voters and churchgoers, especially in the eastern half of the country, helping him fend off a fierce challenge from Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw. The opposition was fueled by support from young people around the country, securing a majority of votes from people under 50, and turnout was among the highest since the country turned away from communism. Poland’s major cities, from Gdansk in the north to Krakow in the south, were bastions of resistance, but the governing party rallied its faithful in rural communities, many left behind in the rapid transition from communism to capitalism. Mr. Trzaskowski conceded defeat Monday afternoon after the country’s electoral commission said that with 100 percent of the actual vote counted, Mr. Duda had secured 51.03 percent of the vote. Mr. Trzaskowski won 48.97 percent. The turnout was 68.18 percent. While Mr. Duda struck a conciliatory tone in remarks to supporters on Sunday, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on Monday that Mr. Duda would continue to advance the government’s agenda, which he described as “pro-family policies,” a focus on social issues and “a more just redistribution” of wealth. “Most important,” he said, “is to complete the judiciary reform and other state bodies, so everything is more professional, faster.” Writing on Twitter, Mr. Trzaskowski thanked the roughly 10 million people who voted for him, but conceded the contest. It was a bitter defeat for opponents of the government. The Warsaw mayor was not even a candidate when the election was postponed in May because of the coronavirus, but he mounted a serious challenge against an incumbent president who had the backing of state television and important church leaders. With the next parliamentary elections not scheduled until 2023, Mr. Duda’s re-election ensured that the governing party, which also controls the Parliament, will be able to continue to reshape the nation in ways that critics contend undermine open political debate and the rule of law, and put it at odds with the European Union, which has accused Poland of damaging democratic values and institutions. Mr. Trzaskowski had cast the election as a fight for the soul of the nation. He promised to end a government that uses state media to promote its views and silence opposing voices, manipulates the courts and uses fear and division to build support. The mayor, whose campaign rallies were as likely to feature the blue and gold of the European Union flag as the red and white of Poland, said he wanted to live in a country where “an open hand wins against a clenched fist.” Mr. Duda, however, dismissed concerns about Poland’s illiberal drift as an invention of foreign interests. He attacked Mr. Trzaskowski over his support for L.G.B.T. rights — a powerful argument in a staunchly Catholic country, particularly outside its cosmopolitan cities. Thomas Boserup, an independent election observer from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the voting and counting process was carried out well and all the coronavirus precautions were observed. But he said that there were threats reported against journalists and politicians. “The polarization was illustrated by the fact that candidates did not participate in one debate, depriving the voters from comparing their views,” he said, noting that public television had failed in its duty to impartially cover the election. “We were worried by instances of intolerant rhetoric of a homophobic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic nature, particularly among the president’s campaign and the public television.” Mr. Duda’s campaign received a boost recently from President Trump, who met with him at the White House just days before the election and all but endorsed him. “He’s doing a terrific job,” Mr. Trump said of the incumbent. “The people of Poland think the world of him.” An already bitter campaign turned even uglier in the final days before Sunday’s vote, with Mr. Duda, the Law and Justice party and its supporters in the right-wing media launching a barrage of attacks on Mr. Trzaskowski. In the pro-government weekly Sieci, the Warsaw mayor was accused of supporting pedophilia. State television, which has been turned into a propaganda machine for the government, suggested that Mr. Trzaskowski would be controlled by Jewish interests in complicated questions related to restitution of property dating from World War II. Xenophobic arguments are nothing new for Law and Justice, which took power in 2015 on a campaign against accepting migrants, has described itself as defending Christianity against foreign forces, and has tarred the European Union as a threat to national autonomy. But appeals tinged with anti-Semitism, in a country whose Jews were largely wiped out in the Holocaust, were generally off-limits until recently. Independent news outlets faced escalating attacks during the campaign, with the governing party claiming that Germany and other outside powers were trying to meddle in Poland’s affairs. “Have you ever heard such homophobia, such anti-Semitism, such attacks on everybody who is brave enough to say ‘We have had enough’?” Mr. Trzaskowski asked supporters on Friday. “It’s now or never,” he said. While Mr. Trzaskowski and Mr. Duda represented very different visions for Poland, they have remarkably similar backgrounds. Both were born in 1972 and raised by families considered part of the country’s intelligentsia, and both were academics before entering politics as ministers in the European Union. But their visions for the nation of roughly 38 million could hardly have been more different. Those differences echoed debates playing out in other nations, where traditional democratic values like pluralism have come under assault from populist leaders who undermine institutions and civil society to concentrate power. While the Polish president has limited authority, the office comes with veto power, which Mr. Trzaskowski vowed to use to provide a counterweight to Law and Justice. The leader of the Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, speaking on a popular Catholic broadcast station, accused the Warsaw mayor of lacking a “Polish soul” and a “Polish heart.” “Those who currently push to seize power — at present in the presidential elections, but it’s a known fact that it’s not only about that — these are people who question everything which constitutes our tradition,” Mr. Kaczynski said on Friday. “We just don’t want to have decisions being made somewhere outside of the Polish borders.” While the coronavirus led to a delay in the election, allowing Mr. Trzaskowski to enter the race in May, it was not a major focus of the campaign. Still, the precautions taken at polling stations — including social-distancing requirements — were a reminder of the lingering threat. And with Law and Justice drawing much of its support from older voters, the party redoubled its efforts to ensure that fear of the virus would not limit turnout. “I can assure you, like many others have, that participation in these elections is really absolutely safe,” Mr. Kaczynski said. “It’s even safer than going to the grocery store.” An alert from the Government Security Center, which normally sends out text messages warning of bad weather, was delivered to Polish mobile phones on Saturday reminding people of the elections. “People over the age of 60+, pregnant women and disabled people are entitled to vote at the polling stations without waiting in line,” the alert noted. In the end, it was older voters that gave Mr. Duda the edge he needed.   Monika Pronczuk reported from Warsaw, and Marc Santora from London.

Bartering Child’s Dress for Food: Life in Lebanon’s Economic Crisis,2020-07-12,By Ben Hubbard and Hwaida Saad,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — For three decades, Chef Antoine El Hajj has appeared on television five days a week to help cooks across Lebanon improve their grasp of the culinary arts. Two months ago, as an economic crisis caused Lebanon’s currency to collapse and prices to soar, he realized that many of his viewers could no longer afford staples he had long relied on in his recipes, like beef. “There used to be a middle class in Lebanon, but now the rich are rich, the middle class has become poor and the poor have become destitute,” Mr. El Hajj, 65, said in an interview this past week before going on the air. He has since cut beef from his menus and fills his segments with tips on how to keep dishes tasty with less oil, fewer eggs and cheaper vegetables. Lebanon’s crisis, the result of years of government corruption and financial mismanagement, has caused unemployment and poverty rates to skyrocket, businesses to shutter and salaries to lose their value as inflation soars. Mass protests against the political elite erupted across the country last fall, and sometimes turned violent. The demonstrations tapered off when the country shut down because of the coronavirus but have recently picked up again as the lockdown has added to the economic distress. The effects of the economic meltdown are increasingly infiltrating the daily lives of many Lebanese. Power cuts darken streets, banks refuse to hand over depositors’ cash and families struggle to buy imported essentials like diapers and laundry detergent. The government has long failed to provide sufficient electricity. But blackouts have grown so long that the din of traffic in Beirut, where about one-third of Lebanon’s 5.4 million people live, has been replaced by the roar of overworked generators. Their exhaust fouls the air, and many residential buildings are shutting them off to rest at night, depriving residents of air-conditioning during the sweatiest stretch of the Mediterranean summer. For two days recently, Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the main facility treating Beirut’s Covid-19 cases, suddenly went from one hour without power per day to 20 hours without power, according to its director, Dr. Firass Abiad. So the hospital, which now lacks power six hours a day, has closed some operating rooms and delayed surgeries. “It feels like you are continuously firefighting with no end in sight,” Dr. Abiad said. After dark, Beirut’s once-raucous nightlife has given way to an eerie desolation. Bars have few patrons, main streets are dark and traffic lights at major intersections are out, leaving drivers to navigate on their own, flashing their high beams and hoping for the best as they plow through. The swift collapse has struck a blow to the pride of many Lebanese, who often have claimed to have the Middle East’s best cuisine and have seen themselves as more sophisticated than others in the region. Now, many wonder how far their standard of living will fall. “Beirut is a survival city. People always find ways to eat and drink and make music and do activism. But now, the air is very thick,” said Carmen Geha, an assistant professor of public administration at the American University of Beirut. “Now, even upper-middle-class people can’t afford to eat outside the house. It’s like you take your salary and divide it by nine.” The Lebanese pound, or lira, has lost about 85 percent of its value on the black market since last fall, getting its own satirical Twitter feed where it reacts to its own decline. “I’m the cheapest but I’m not a piece of junk,” the account said early this month amid reports that it was trading at 9,500 to the U.S. dollar, far from the official bank rate of 1,500. Much of the financial distress comes from chaos in the banking system. The central bank ran what critics have called a Ponzi scheme, enticing commercial banks to make large deposits of U.S. dollars with high interest rates that could be covered only by bringing in more large depositors with even higher interest rates. But that system ground to a halt last year when new investors stopped coming, leaving the country’s banks far short of thedollars they owed their depositors. The banks have reacted by mostly refusing to give out dollars, which the Lebanese had long used interchangeably with local currency in daily life. A former Lebanese banker, Dan Azzi, has taken credit for coining a term now widely used for these theoretical dollars that exist only in Lebanese banks: Lollars. The result has been financial pandemonium, and pain. The government has sought to control the black market exchange, where changing money on better terms than the official rate can feel like buying drugs, requiring quick meetings in alleyways with money-changers who use fake names and fear arrest. The effects of the crisis on the country’s poor have been acute, as was made clear by four recent suicides in one two-day period, all linked to the economic crisis. A man who shot himself on one of Beirut’s best-known boulevards left behind a handwritten sign reading “I am not an infidel,” a line from a well-known song whose next lyric is “but hunger is an infidel.” Membership of a Facebook group called Lebanon Barters has swelled, its members offering everything from poker chips to hookahs in exchange for food. Their posts read like tragic poetry. “New weights, never used, to trade for a package of diapers, size 6, and a bottle of oil,” read a post with a photo of dumbbells still in the box. “People need them.” Another post featured a lime-green dress that Fatima al-Hussein, a mother of six from northern Lebanon, had bought as a gift for her daughter. She was looking to trade it for sugar, milk and detergent. In a phone interview, Ms. al-Hussein said her husband makes 200,000 Lebanese pounds per week as a manual laborer, an amount that used to be worth $130. Now it is worth less than $30, leaving her family struggling to afford essentials. She said she decided to trade the dress after she had to start feeding her children bread dipped in water. But so far, she had found no takers. When her neighbors cook, she closes her doors and windows. “I don’t want my children to smell the food,” she said. Before going on air last week, Mr. El Hajj, the television chef, said that what counted as affordable recipes was a moving target. “Beef got expensive so we moved to chicken, and now people are telling me that chicken is expensive, too,” he said. As he prepared the dishes for the day’s show, he fielded calls from viewers struggling with preserving food amid power cuts. How do you make jam from plums or cherries? How do you keep meat fresh when you can’t count on the freezer? He laid out the options. Fruits and vegetables could be canned, pickled or dried. Ground meat could be preserved in fat as confit. “Everything has a solution,” he said after the show, and added, “What is important for me with my program is to help people to continue to eat.”']",A TV chef abandons unaffordable beef. Blackouts make for sweltering summer nights. Changing money feels like a drug deal: The financial meltdown means daily pain and a blow to a country’s pride.
"Taliban Stage a Major Attack, as Violence Intensifies in Northern Afghanistan",2020-07-13,By Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban waged a sustained assault against an Afghan intelligence complex in the city of Aybak on Monday, killing at least 11 people and wounding more than 60 others, part of a bloody wave of violence across the country’s north. With the opening of peace talks between the insurgency and the Afghan government stalled for months, the Taliban have intensified their offensives, creating one of the deadliest years of the long war. On Monday, insurgents detonated a car bomb at the entrance of the provincial headquarters of Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security in Aybak, the capital of Samangan Province, about 150 miles northwest of Kabul. The blast, which also struck a nearby municipal compound, opened the way for fighters to enter the intelligence agency complex, where they battled the Afghan forces for hours, said Sefatullah Samangani, the deputy governor of the province. Mr. Samangani said 11 officers of the intelligence agency, mostly men but at least one woman, were killed and 63 others were wounded. Only 15 of the wounded were intelligence officers and the rest civilians. “The blast was so strong that it broke people’s windows three kilometers away,” Mr. Samangani said. “The building of the intelligence agency and the municipality building are not usable anymore.”  Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, confirmed that the insurgency was behind the attack. A major attack inside a city seems to breach an understanding between the United States and the Taliban, which signed a preliminary peace deal in February that begun the withdrawal of American forces. And it broke with the Taliban tactics in recent months of escalating violence in the countryside without claiming many of the attacks, while the cities were largely spared except for hit-and-run assassinations.  The deal, in which the Taliban guaranteed that they would not attack American targets, has faced criticism because it lacked any guarantee of a cease-fire with Afghans. But American officials have said that they had an understanding with the Taliban that the insurgents would reduce their levels of violence by as much as 80 percent and not attack in major cities and population centers. Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, called on the Taliban to stop what he described as “criminal and inhumane” attacks that could derail the peace efforts.  “Turning to violence and killing people for leverage in negotiations is the worst approach that, unfortunately, the Taliban have taken up,” Mr. Ghani said in a statement. The violence continues unabated as the poor nation grapples with the spread of Covid-19 and its economic ramifications. Although official numbers are dubious, with testing capacity extremely low, the country’s health ministry has recorded nearly 35,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths. The February deal was expected to open the way within 10 days for the more complicated part of the peace process: talks with the Afghan government over a future power-sharing agreement. But those talks have been repeatedly delayed over complications with a prisoner swap that was laid out as a precondition for negotiations. The American deal with the Taliban called for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for 1,000 Afghan security forces held by the insurgents — a clause that angered many Afghan officials. After balking for weeks, the Afghan government began a phased release of Taliban prisoners, under heavy pressure from the Trump administration. But with more than 4,000 Taliban released, the last stretch is once again facing difficulty, as the Afghan government says it cannot release about 500 of those on the Taliban list because they are deemed dangerous and are accused of serious crimes. Javid Faisal, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s National Security Council, said the government has proposed that the Taliban suggest new names instead of the 592 that cannot be released. It is unclear whether the insurgents have agreed to that. “We have told them that we are ready to release alternative people,” Mr. Faisal said. The ongoing attack in Samangan caps a bloody 24 hours in northern Afghanistan, where Taliban launched attacks in several provinces, officials said. At least 20 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in overnight assaults in two districts of Kunduz Province. In Badakhshan Province, the Taliban attacked security posts in Arghanj Khwa district, killing at least seven from the security forces.

"Driver Purposely Drove Bus Into China Reservoir, Killing 21, Police Say",2020-07-13,By Tiffany May,"['A bus crash in southwest China last week that killed 21 people and injured 15 others was caused by the driver, who deliberately steered into a reservoir because he was angry at the demolition of his home, the police have said. The crash on Tuesday, which also killed the driver, drew an outpouring of grief; some of the passengers included students traveling to take China’s notoriously difficult college entrance exam. The police in Anshun, a city in Guizhou Province, said in a statement on Sunday that the 52-year-old driver, identified only by his last name, Zhang, had been aggrieved over the demolition of his home that morning. The driver crashed the passenger bus, the police said, to send a message. “Due to his dissatisfaction with his life’s circumstances and the demolition of rented public housing and in order to cause a stir, he has committed extreme crimes that endanger public safety,” the police report said. The authorities said the driver had rented a 430-square-foot unit in a state-owned public housing structure included in a redevelopment scheme. He signed an agreement in June to receive $10,000 in compensation, but did not claim the sum. His applications for public housing were rejected, but plans for the demolition of the building went forward. The case shines a light on the often-silent victims displaced by China’s urban redevelopment schemes, in which state-sponsored developers tear down older, shabbier buildings in dilapidated neighborhoods to build gleaming office towers, shopping malls and expensive housing. On Tuesday morning, the bus driver called a government hotline to complain that his home was about to be demolished before he could receive government housing, the police report said. He then traded shifts with a colleague and bought some baijiu, a colorless alcoholic drink, that he took to work in a water bottle. He left some voice messages for his girlfriend on WeChat, expressing weariness and disgust with the world, and sipped from the bottle before starting his shift, the police report said. Security video showed the bus cutting across three lanes of oncoming traffic around midday Tuesday as it traveled along Hongshan Lake in Anshun. It then plunged down a series of low terraces and into the lake, becoming submerged by more than 30 feet of water. Some passengers were students preparing to take the gaokao, the national college placement test, reported The Paper, a state-run online publication based in Shanghai. At least five of those killed were students, officials said. The gaokao, which began on Tuesday, was delayed for a month because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 10 million students are participating this year. Caixin, a Chinese-language magazine, published an article on Friday about the demolition of the bus driver’s home and his efforts to stop it. The story, which drew sympathy for the working-class residents displaced by urban redevelopment projects in China, was later taken offline. The government authorities in Anshun said in a statement on Sunday that they would investigate the demolition, and any mistakes made in the process. Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.']","The 52-year-old driver, who was also killed, was aggrieved about the demolition of his home because of a redevelopment scheme, officials said."
"Defying U.S., China and Iran Near Trade and Military Partnership",2020-07-11,By Farnaz Fassihi and Steven Lee Myers,"['Iran and China have quietly drafted a sweeping economic and security partnership that would clear the way for billions of dollars of Chinese investments in energy and other sectors, undercutting the Trump administration’s efforts to isolate the Iranian government because of its nuclear and military ambitions. The partnership, detailed in an 18-page proposed agreement obtained by The New York Times, would vastly expand Chinese presence in banking, telecommunications, ports, railways and dozens of other projects. In exchange, China would receive a regular — and, according to an Iranian official and an oil trader, heavily discounted — supply of Iranian oil over the next 25 years. The document also describes deepening military cooperation, potentially giving China a foothold in a region that has been a strategic preoccupation of the United States for decades. It calls for joint training and exercises, joint research and weapons development and intelligence sharing — all to fight “the lopsided battle with terrorism, drug and human trafficking and cross-border crimes.” The partnership — first proposed by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, during a visit to Iran in 2016 — was approved by President Hassan Rouhani’s cabinet in June, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said last week. Iranian officials have publicly stated that there is a pending agreement with China, and one Iranian official, as well as several people who have discussed it with the Iranian government, confirmed that it is the document obtained by The Times, which is labeled “final version” and dated June 2020. It has not yet been submitted to Iran’s Parliament for approval or made public, stoking suspicions in Iran about how much the government is preparing to give away to China. In Beijing, officials have not disclosed the terms of the agreement, and it is not clear whether Mr. Xi’s government has signed off or, if it has, when it might announce it. If put into effect as detailed, the partnership would create new and potentially dangerous flash points in the deteriorating relationship between China and the United States. It represents a major blow to the Trump administration’s aggressive policy toward Iran since abandoning the nuclear deal reached in 2015 by President Barack Obama and the leaders of six other nations after two years of grueling negotiations. Renewed American sanctions, including the threat to cut off access to the international banking system for any company that does business in Iran, have succeeded in suffocating the Iranian economy by scaring away badly needed foreign trade and investment. But Tehran’s desperation has pushed it into the arms of China, which has the technology and appetite for oil that Iran needs. Iran has been one of the world’s largest oil producers, but its exports, Tehran’s largest source of revenue, have plunged since the Trump administration began imposing sanctions in 2018; China gets about 75 percent of its oil from abroad and is the world’s largest importer, at more than 10 million barrels a day last year. At a time when the United States is reeling from recession and the coronavirus, and increasingly isolated internationally, Beijing senses American weakness. The draft agreement with Iran shows that unlike most countries, China feels it is in a position to defy the United States, powerful enough to withstand American penalties, as it has in the trade war waged by President Trump. “Two ancient Asian cultures, two partners in the sectors of trade, economy, politics, culture and security with a similar outlook and many mutual bilateral and multilateral interests will consider one another strategic partners,” the document says in its opening sentence. The Chinese investments in Iran, which two people who have been briefed on the deal said would total $400 billion over 25 years, could spur still more punitive actions against Chinese companies, which have already been targeted by the administration in recent months. “The United States will continue to impose costs on Chinese companies that aid Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism,” a State Department spokeswoman wrote in response to questions about the draft agreement. “By allowing or encouraging Chinese companies to conduct sanctionable activities with the Iranian regime, the Chinese government is undermining its own stated goal of promoting stability and peace.” The expansion of military assistance, training and intelligence-sharing will also be viewed with alarm in Washington. American warships already tangle regularly with Iranian forces in the crowded waters of the Persian Gulf and challenge China’s internationally disputed claim to much of the South China Sea, and the Pentagon’s national security strategy has declared China an adversary. When reports of a long-term investment agreement with Iran surfaced last September, China’s foreign ministry dismissed the question out of hand. Asked about it again last week, a spokesman, Zhao Lijian, left open the possibility that a deal was in the works. “China and Iran enjoy traditional friendship, and the two sides have been in communication on the development of bilateral relations,” he said. “We stand ready to work with Iran to steadily advance practical cooperation.” The projects — nearly 100 are cited in the draft agreement — are very much in keeping with Mr. Xi’s ambitions to extend its economic and strategic influence across Eurasia through the “Belt and Road Initiative,” a vast aid and investment program. The projects, including airports, high-speed railways and subways, would touch the lives of millions of Iranians. China would develop free-trade zones in Maku, in northwestern Iran; in Abadan, where the Shatt al-Arab river flows into the Persian Gulf, and on the gulf island Qeshm. The agreement also includes proposals for China to build the infrastructure for a 5G telecommunications network, to offer the new Chinese Global Positioning System, Beidou, and to help Iranian authorities assert greater control over what circulates in cyberspace, presumably as China’s Great Firewall does. The American campaign against a major Chinese telecommunications company, Huawei, includes a criminal case against its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, for seeking to disguise investments in Iran in order to evade American sanctions. The Trump administration has barred Huawei from involvement in 5G development in the United States, and has tried, without great success, to persuade other countries to do the same. Moving ahead with a broad investment program in Iran appears to signal Beijing’s growing impatience with the Trump administration after its abandonment of the nuclear agreement. China has repeatedly called on the administration to preserve the deal, which it was a party to, and has sharply denounced the American use of unilateral sanctions. Iran has traditionally looked west toward Europe for trade and investment partners. Increasingly though, it has grown frustrated with European countries that have opposed Mr. Trump’s policy but quietly withdrawn from the kinds of deals that the nuclear agreement once promised. “Iran and China both view this deal as a strategic partnership in not just expanding their own interests but confronting the U.S.,” said Ali Gholizadeh, an Iranian energy researcher at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. “It is the first of its kind for Iran keen on having a world power as an ally.” The proposed partnership has nonetheless stoked a fierce debate within Iran. Mr. Zarif, the foreign minister, who traveled to Beijing last October to negotiate the agreement, faced hostile questioning about it in Parliament last week. The document was provided to The Times by someone familiar with its drafting with the intention of showing the scope of the projects now under consideration. Mr. Zarif said the agreement would be submitted to Parliament for final approval. It has the support of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, two Iranian officials said. Ayatollah Khamenei’s top economic adviser, Ali Agha Mohammadi, appeared on state television recently to discuss the need for an economic lifeline. He said Iran needs to increase its oil production to at least 8.5 million barrels a day in order to remain a player in the energy market, and for that, it needs China. Iranian supporters of the strategic partnership say that given the country’s limited economic options, the free-falling currency and the dim prospect of U.S. sanctions being lifted, the deal with China could provide a lifeline. “Every road is closed to Iran,” said Fereydoun Majlesi, a former diplomat and a columnist for several Iranian newspapers on diplomacy. “The only path open is China. Whatever it is, until sanctions are lifted, this deal is the best option.” But critics across the political spectrum in Iran have raised concerns that the government is secretly “selling off” the country to China in a moment of economic weakness and international isolation. In a speech in late June, a former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, called it a suspicious secret deal that the people of Iran would never approve. The critics have cited previous Chinese investment projects that have left countries in Africa and Asia indebted and ultimately beholden to the authorities in Beijing. A particular concern has been the proposed port facilities in Iran, including two along the coast of the Sea of Oman. One at Jask, just outside of the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance to the Persian Gulf, would give the Chinese a strategic vantage point on the waters through which much of the world’s oil transits. The passage is of critical strategic importance to the United States, whose Navy’s Fifth Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain, in the gulf. China has already constructed a series of ports along the Indian Ocean, creating a necklace of refueling and resupply stations from the South China Sea to the Suez Canal. Ostensibly commercial in nature, the ports potentially have military value, too, allowing China’s rapidly growing navy to expand its reach. Those include ports at Hambantota in Sri Lanka and Gwadar in Pakistan, which are widely criticized as footholds for a potential military presence, though no Chinese forces have officially been deployed at them. China opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti in 2015, ostensibly to support its forces participating in international antipiracy operations off the coast of Somalia. The outpost, which began as a logistics base but is now more heavily fortified, is within miles of the American base in that country. China has also stepped up military cooperation with Iran. The People’s Liberation Army Navy has visited and participated in military exercises at least three times, beginning in 2014. The most recent was last December, when a Chinese missile destroyer, the Xining, joined a naval exercise with the Russian and Iranian navies in the Gulf of Oman. China’s state-owned Xinhua news agency quoted the commander of Iran’s Navy, Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi, saying that the exercise showed “the era of American invasions in the region is over.” David E.

Hindu God in a Music Video? A K-Pop Band Runs Afoul of Fans,2020-07-11,By Tiffany May and Su-Hyun Lee,"['The statue of the Hindu god Ganesha flashed onscreen for just seconds in the music video by Blackpink, an all-female K-pop band. The elephant-headed deity was shown on the floor, near a bejeweled Aladdin lamp, as a member of the band preened and rapped on a golden throne. That glimpse of Ganesha in the video for “How You Like That” was enough for eagle-eyed K-pop fans, many of them in India, to unleash a torrent of criticism against Blackpink last month, accusing the group of cultural appropriation, of using the religious object as a prop and of defiling it by placing it on the ground. They demanded that the image be removed. “No hate to the artists but our hindu religion and Gods aren’t a toy/prop/aesthetic for pop culture music videos to use,” a fan from Delhi with the user name Iam_drish wrote on Twitter, adding that it wasn’t the first time Indian and Southeast Asian culture had been disrespected by K-pop. As the tempest grew, Ganesha suddenly vanished from the video posted on YouTube, and fans declared victory. On Wednesday, Blackpink’s management acknowledged that it had edited the deity out, saying in a statement that its use had been an “unintentional mistake.” The swift re-editing of the Blackpink video illustrated how K-pop fans, who are deeply invested in the mythmaking of their musical idols, use the internet to spread their messages, reach the artists (and their management) almost instantly and get quick results. K-pop, fueled by highly choreographed musical performances, is South Korea’s biggest cultural export. The country’s music industry generated more than $5 billion in revenue in 2018, most of it from K-pop, according to a white paper published by the Korea Creative Content Agency in March. YG Entertainment, the agency that manages Blackpink, made $220 million in revenue in 2019. But the fans are key to the phenomenon, and they know it. They have helped to propel bands like Blackpink to stardom by coordinating mass postings and stunts on social media before an album release or a star’s birthday — in some cases, even pooling their money to buy subway ads. Blackpink, whose members use the stage names Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa (real names Ji-soo Kim, Jennie Kim, Roseanne Park and Lalisa Manoban), has more than 100 million followers across social media platforms. But K-pop fans — an internet-savvy army that spans the globe and counts members of different races, ages and social-economic strata among its ranks — are also pushing their idols to be socially progressive. They have become more politically active, claiming to have targeted an Oklahoma rally for President Trump’s campaign by registering for thousands of tickets with no intention of showing up. K-pop groups are also reaching across cultural boundaries to find new muses. The boy band BTS was praised for “Idol,” a song released in 2018 that was infused with Afro-beats and Korean folk rhythms. But bands have also stumbled over cultural and racial red lines. The inclusion of religious and socially sensitive motifs for their opulent-looking video backdrops and candy-colored costumes has led to accusations of cultural misappropriation. Members of Blackpink, for example, were criticized for wearing bindis and box braids. Ganesha was the latest cultural touchstone to stir up the fan base. YG Entertainment, Blackpink’s agency, was bombarded by social media posts and emails, some of which followed a fan-created template. Fans demanded a public apology and the Ganesha statue’s removal. On June 30, the agency uploaded a new version of the “How You Like That”\xa0video without the deity. “It was immediately edited when we became aware of it,” said a YG representative, Cho Woo-young. Vedansh Varshney, a 21-year-old university student and K-pop fan from Delhi, said of K-pop’s cultural mash-ups: “Some people will feel like our culture is represented. But this is not the situation at all when it becomes disrespectful.” The list of comparable K-pop scandals includes a 2016 social media post by Taeyang, a singer with the band Big Bang, who used an app to merge his face with an image of Kanye West and wish his followers a “Happy Monkey New Year.” In 2017, the group Mamamoo performed a parody of “Uptown Funk” in blackface. In 2018, an old photograph circulated online showing a member of the K-pop band BTS wearing a hat with a badge resembling Nazi insignia. A photograph of another band member in a T-shirt with a picture evoking the atomic bombing of Japan by the United States had already been widely shared. Apologies followed, along with suggestions that cultural ignorance was to blame. But some ask why the bands keep making similar mistakes. Some experts point to South Korea’s history to explain the prism through which K-pop artists distill foreign influences and inspiration. “When you take elements of a culture and use it in a way that demeans or ridicules the people in that culture, that’s disrespectful,” said Crystal Anderson, an affiliate Korean studies faculty member at George Mason University. “What is often left out of the conversation is how those images and their creators got to places like East Asia in the first place,” Dr. Anderson said by telephone.  South Korea was largely cut off from the outside world during the Cold War, with many newspapers, books and films banned by military dictators. As the country opened up in the 1990s, many looked to America as a model for cultural success. But some racist tropes were imported and replicated during a campaign called “Let’s learn from Hollywood,” scholars say. “When foreign cultures came into Korea, they arrived through the lens of mainstream American media, making the situation prone to distortion,” said Shim Doobo, a professor of media and communication at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul. “K-pop has grown faster than the industry had time to raise issues with or reflect on their problematic behavior,” Dr. Shim added. Even as fans chastise K-pop stars for using offensive images, it is unclear how many independent artistic choices the singers are allowed to make. The groups are tightly managed by agencies that dictate virtually every detail of their public lives, from their appearance to their romantic relationships. Discussions of racism in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis have also led to calls for change in K-pop. Last month, many praised BTS’s donation of $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement, following up with donations of their own. But Black fans also renewed longstanding critiques about K-pop, particularly what they saw as a refusal to recognize the genre’s influences in Black music, dance and culture. Still, though all the controversies — even the unholy pairing of a Hindu god with gyrating musical stars — the international army of K-pop fans has remained fiercely loyal. Mr. Varshney, the student from Delhi, said the genre had inspired him to shuck off traditional macho behavior and a hypermasculine appearance. He started learning Korean three years ago to understand the lyrics, and he mashes up K-pop choreography with Bollywood music. But Mr. Varshney wants his K-pop idols to include more nuanced portrayals of other cultures in the music he loves. “If there is a pattern and we don’t speak out about it, it will keep happening,” he said.']",A tempest over the band Blackpink’s use of a Hindu god in a video was the latest example of K-pop fans holding artists to account — while staying fiercely loyal.
"As India Struggles With Coronavirus, Bollywood’s Biggest Star Tests Positive",2020-07-12,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — When this country’s biggest film star, Amitabh Bachchan, announced Saturday night that he had contracted the coronavirus, a loud alarm bell rang across India. Mr. Bachchan, known as Big B, is not simply an enormously successful actor. He is one of India’s most revered figures. His face and rich, avuncular voice, dripping with gravitas, are everywhere, deployed in ads for household products, voice-overs at museums and countless public service campaigns. He was recently roped into doing a campaign on — what else? — the coronavirus. The worry was that if Big B could catch the virus, anybody could, and with India getting walloped by Covid-19, Mr. Bachchan, 77, said on Twitter on Saturday: “All that have been in close proximity to me in the last 10 days are requested to please get themselves tested!” India is now racking up more new reported infections each day — about 30,000 — than any other country except the United States and Brazil — and it is rapidly catching up to Brazil. India now has the third-highest total cases after the United States and Brazil. The authorities in several big Indian cities and states are reinstating quarantines after attempting to loosen things up to stimulate a critically wounded economy. The borders between states are again being rigorously patrolled, with visitors shunted off to isolation centers. International travel is still blocked. Hospitals are overflowing with the sick. Even emergencies are being turned away. One pregnant woman was left to die in the back of an ambulance a few weeks ago after being rejected from eight hospitals in 15 hours. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to lift spirits by saying in televised speeches that India is still doing better than richer countries, especially when it comes to the death rate. India has reported about 16 coronavirus-related deaths per million people, while the United States, Brazil, Spain and Italy have all lost hundreds per million. Experts think this might be for a few reasons. India’s average age, around 28, is younger than that of other countries. Obesity is less prevalent, too, and many doctors believe that obesity creates a greater vulnerability to the coronavirus. Some medical professionals also believe that Indians have strong immune systems because of their constant exposure to microbes, living in cities that are not as clean as cities in the West. Another explanation, though, might simply be testing — or the lack of it. India has performed far fewer coronavirus tests per capita than many other countries have. Either way, the Indian authorities keep coming up with innovative ways to fight the virus. At airports, for instance, video cameras have been installed that enable security officers to check passengers’ boarding passes remotely to minimize face-to-face contact. The officers who use electromagnetic wands to screen passengers now use wands attached to four-foot rubber poles to maintain distance. And many Indians, even the poorest, have been wearing face masks for months. India’s biggest enemy is the density of its population. This country has dozens of cities with more than a million people. Even in smaller towns and villages, many families live in cramped quarters, eight or even 10 people to a room, which makes a highly contagious illness like the coronavirus very hard to stop. In many of these areas, it is impossible to maintain social distancing. In recent weeks, Mumbai, one of India’s most-packed cities and home to Mr. Bachchan, the movie star, has especially struggled. The virus started out in Mumbai’s wealthier neighborhoods among the jet-setter crowd. Then it swept through the slums. Now it is gnawing through the entire city, home to 20 million. On Saturday night, Mr. Bachchan announced via Twitter — where he has 43.2 million followers — that he had tested positive. He was soon admitted to Nanavati Hospital, near the exclusive Juhu neighborhood in Mumbai where he lives, overlooking the Arabian Sea. It appears that several of his family members have fallen sick as well. His son, Abhishek Bachchan, also an actor, disclosed that he had contracted the coronavirus. Abhishek’s wife, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, an actress and model, tested positive, as did their 8-year-old daughter, Aaradhya. All seemed to have mild symptoms, officials said. The illness in the illustrious Bachchan clan was such big news that the health minister of Maharashtra State issued a Twitter post about it at 4:30 a.m. Sunday. “I pray to god that Amitabh Bachchan Ji recovers from this soon,” the minister, Rajesh Tope, said, adding the respectful “Ji” to Mr. Bachchan’s name. It is hard to overstate how big Big B really is. Walk through just about any city in India, and there is his handsome, gray-bearded face staring down from a billboard or a railway bridge, advertising a new phone app or chocolate bar or public health campaign. The son of a renowned poet, Mr. Bachchan is celebrated for his mastery of language and diction. He has acted in more than 200 films over the past 50 years — and he is still working and drawing admirers. Until the coronavirus lockdown brought life to a screeching halt this spring, thousands of fans would camp out in front of his Mumbai mansion nearly every Sunday, hoping to get a glimpse of him. Mr. Bachchan would step out from his gates for a few minutes and stand on a stool and graciously wave. “He’s like god,” said Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, a filmmaker who has worked with Mr. Bachchan. “I’ve never seen a star having such power, such credibility. He’s the biggest superstar this country has ever, ever seen.” Part of Mr. Bachchan’s appeal, Mr. Dungarpur said, was that, for half a century, Mr. Bachchan has carefully chosen roles where he is fighting against all odds, taking on the system, getting justice for the common man. He is also very civically minded and has helped out with many real-life causes. Mr. Dungarpur, who runs a film preservation foundation to save heritage films across South Asia, said Mr. Bachchan had helped him immensely, serving as the foundation’s brand ambassador. His contracting of the coronavirus might create more fear across India. But it could also help take away some of the stigma that infected Indians have endured, evidenced by people kicked out of their neighborhoods and a few even driven to suicide. Mr. Dungarpur predicted that a lot of Indians would find his struggle inspiring and say to themselves, “If Amitabh Bachchan can fight this, so can we.” Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from Jaipur, India, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.']","Amitabh Bachchan, whose face is everywhere in the country, checked into a hospital with mild symptoms.

China Imposes Tit-for-Tat Sanctions on Three American Lawmakers,2020-07-13,By Keith Bradsher,"['BEIJING — As tensions between the two sides mount, the Chinese government announced on Monday that it would impose sanctions on three American lawmakers and a diplomat in retaliation for similar moves last week by the Trump administration against four  officials in China. The largely symbolic sanctions targeted Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, all of whom are Republicans. Also named were Sam Brownback, President Trump’s ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, a United States government agency that focuses on human rights. The Trump administration imposed its sanctions in response to what it describes as pervasive human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang region, home to the largely Muslim Uighur minority. The administration banned four Chinese officials and a Chinese government agency last Thursday from accessing American banks and other financial institutions. It also restricted them from obtaining visas to the United States.  Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday that China had to react to American interference in its domestic affairs. “We urge the U.S. side to immediately revoke the wrong decision and stop any words and deeds that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests,” Ms. Hua said at a news briefing. “China will make further response according to the development of the situation.” Ms. Hua described the Chinese sanctions as “corresponding.” But she did not provide details on how they might prevent the targeted Americans from using China’s financial system or obtaining Chineses visas. The sanctions are likely to be mostly symbolic on both sides, as neither the Chinese officials nor the Americans are known to have assets in each other’s financial systems. Relations between the United States and China are increasingly strained. The administration has banned certain high-tech exports to Hong Kong in response to a newly imposed national security law in the territory, while President Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic, an accusation Beijing resents. The Trump administration took the latest action after weeks of heavy pressure from Congress, including an overwhelming, bipartisan vote by the House in May in favor of penalties against senior Chinese officials in Xinjiang. The United States applied sanctions to Chen Quanguo — a member of China’s 25-member ruling Politburo and party secretary of the Xinjiang region. The administration also penalized Zhu Hailun, a former deputy party secretary for the region; Wang Mingshan, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau; and Huo Liujun, a former party secretary of the bureau. The bureau itself was also included in the sanctions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday that the American sanctions were in response to “forced labor, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith.” Chinese security forces have rounded up as many as a million mostly Muslim members of ethnic minorities in barbed-wire camps and prisons for extensive indoctrination, among other human rights abuses. The Chinese government began its crackdown several years ago after a series of attacks on civilians that Beijing attributed to Uighur extremists. Ms. Hua said on Monday that the Chinese government was “unswervingly determined to combat violent and terrorist forces, separatist forces and religious extremist forces.” Claire Fu contributed research.']","The sanctions, which target Republican members of Congress, were in retaliation for the Trump administration’s bans on Chinese officials accused of human rights abuses."
"Suriname Elects a New President, Ending Bouterse’s Long Rule",2020-07-13,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Harmen Boerboom,"['Suriname elected a new president on Monday, ending the long rule of Desi Bouterse, who dominated the small South American nation’s politics since its independence through intimidation and charisma. The president, Chan Santokhi, a 61-year-old former police chief and leader of the opposition, was elected to the office by Suriname’s Congress following a landslide opposition victory in the May general elections. In handing Mr. Santokhi a victory, the Surinamese punished Mr. Bouterse, a former military dictator turned populist champion, for a disastrous economic crisis and the widespread corruption in his government. Mr. Santokhi takes charge of a deeply divided nation teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and struggling to contain the coronavirus, which has infected 741 people and killed 18. “We’re on the brink of a financial abyss,” Mr. Santokhi said in Congress Monday, as he promised to unite Suriname’s ethnically diverse citizens. “This crisis has surpassed every worst-case scenario we had expected.” Suriname’s longer-term prospects appear brighter, as the country is expected to begin exploiting major new offshore oil discoveries by 2026. The new government will have to rebuild Suriname’s damaged relations with the Netherlands, Suriname’s former colonial ruler and major trade partner, whose judges had convicted Mr. Bouterse of drug trafficking in absentia in 1999. In the last 10 years in office, Mr. Bouterse had shifted Suriname’s foreign alliances away from the Netherlands and toward China and nearby Venezuela, whose redistributive economic policies and anti-imperialist rhetoric he copied at home. Mr. Bouterse leaves power as he appeals another criminal conviction, this time at home, for his role in the murder of 15 prominent political opponents following a 1980 military coup. Even as he loses his presidential immunity, it is unclear that he will serve the 20 year sentence the court handed down. As police chief, Mr. Santokhi had investigated Mr. Bouterse for his role in the violence connected to the coup, a deeply traumatizing event for Suriname’s older generation known as the “December Murders.” Some in Suriname, however, fear that trying to enforce the homicide sentence could provoke riots from Mr. Bouterse’s well-organized supporters and make the small nation ungovernable. After four decades of running the country in different guises, Mr. Bouterse retains strong connections in the Suriname’s military, commands a large personal fortune and enjoys the adoration of a loyal base. But in a sign of conciliation, Mr. Bouterse, an elected lawmaker, made a rare appearance in Congress on Monday, where he congratulated the new government. “Out of experience, I can tell you it won’t be an easy job,” Mr. Bouterse said. In an attempt to maintain his support ahead of elections, Mr. Bouterse raided the reserves of private banks and imposed restrictions on foreign exchange rates earlier this year. The moves proved popular with his core supporters but provoked an unprecedented backlash from the private sector and devastated an already damaged economy. Economic mismanagement proved to be Mr. Bouterse’s undoing. The Surinamese abandoned his ruling party in droves, voting many of his chief allies out of power. Mr. Bouterse’s top economic policymaker, Amzad Abdoel, received 117 votes out of more than 70,000 cast in his congressional district.']","Desi Bouterse has cast a long shadow over Suriname since its independence. Once a dictator, he returned as a populist, but fell in the face of the pandemic and an economic crisis."
A Health Worker Raised Alarms About the Coronavirus. Then He Lost His Job.,2020-07-13,By Emma Bubola,"['MILAN — In February, he said the directors of the nursing home where he worked kept him from wearing a mask, fearing it would scare patients and their families. In March, he became infected and spoke out about the coronavirus spreading through the home. In May, he was fired amid claims that he had “damaged the company’s image.” Hamala Diop, a 25-year-old medical assistant, challenged the decision in a lawsuit that was first heard in court on Monday. The proceedings will raise the issue of whether whistle-blowers have paid a price in raising alarms about dangerous conditions at medical facilities. After successfully lowering the curve of new cases after a devastating initial outbreak, Italy is now bracing for a potential second wave. The country, with the oldest population in Europe, was affected especially deeply by the coronavirus, and nearly half the infections reported in April happened in nursing homes, according to the Italian National Institute of Health. The breadth of the outbreak put the management of nursing homes under judicial and media scrutiny. As the country fears the emergence of new clusters, some worry that Mr. Diop’s experience could have a chilling effect on those seeking to raise early warnings about potentially dangerous behaviors. “Nobody protected us from catching the virus,” Mr. Diop said, “and nobody protected us from getting fired.” On Feb. 26, as officials had already sealed off towns in the northern region of Lombardy, a director at the Palazzolo Institute of the Don Gnocchi Foundation, a nursing home in Milan where Mr. Diop worked, walked to the ward where Mr. Diop and his colleagues were tidying up the dining room. Mr. Diop said in an interview the director told them not to wear masks, that the building was safe and that they should not scare the residents. When presented with this account, the foundation said that they had always rejected any accusation that the employees were kept from using masks as “serious and baseless.” For more than two weeks, while the coronavirus epidemic was exploding in the region, Mr. Diop said that he and his colleagues washed, changed and fed the residents without wearing masks or other protection. More than 150 residents would die in March and April, according to Milan’s prosecutors investigating the case. Asked if that figure was accurate, nursing home officials declined to comment. “They watched TV and saw what was going on outside,” he said of the residents, “but I had to reassure them and tell them that the virus will never come into our safe place.” The human resources director encouraged managers to place on leave employees who “polemicized” or insisted on wearing protective gear “even when they are not required to,” according to an email submitted as evidence. Mr. Diop said that he received his first mask on March 12, when more than 15,000 people in the country had already been infected and days after the government had imposed nationwide restrictions on movement and work. That same day, Mr. Diop fell ill. A week later, his swab test came back positive for the virus. His mother, who also works at the home, was infected, too. Eleven days after becoming sick, he filed his complaint along with 17 colleagues, most of whom also had the virus. In it, they argued that management had covered up the first coronavirus cases among the staff and prevented them from using the necessary protective gear, contributing to the spread in the nursing home. “We are their arms and their legs and they all become like our grandpas and grandmas,” Mr. Diop said of the residents. “And they kept us from protecting them,” he said in reference to the management. In a statement, the foundation’s lawyers said the home had followed the instructions of the Italian National Institute of Health on the use of masks, and that communications about the infections among workers took place according to privacy laws. After news of the lawsuit was published by Italian newspapers, dozens of victims’ families filed similar complaints. Milanese prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the home’s management. On May 7, Mr. Diop was fired by the cooperative that employed him, a subcontractor for the foundation, for talking to reporters about the lawsuit, and many of his colleagues have also been transferred or dismissed. Mr. Diop challenged the decision, and his lawyer, Romolo Reboa, argues in court filings that Italian and European laws on whistle-blowers should protect workers who raise alarms about situations that put lives at risk. Mr. Reboa cited a similar case of a nurse in Rome who was fired after anonymously speaking on the radio about the lack of masks in his hospital. “In nursing homes, the politics of Covid was if you speak, you get sanctioned,” Mr. Reboa said. “And this created a climate of intimidation that had a direct impact on the number of deaths.” Mr. Diop, originally from Mali, lives with his parents and two siblings in Cormano, a small town north of Milan. He said that losing his job was a serious financial setback and that he was worried he would not find new work given his record. While he had expected to face some consequences for his actions, he said he did not think he would lose his job, since the government had imposed a freeze on layoffs during the emergency and health care workers were particularly in demand. “We only are heroes when they like it,” he said.']",A lawsuit by a nursing home employee in Italy will test whether health care professionals are paying a price for pointing out dangerous conditions at medical facilities.
Protests Rock Russian Far East With Calls for Putin to Resign,2020-07-11,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Tens of thousands of people protested in Russia’s Far East on Saturday in a rare display of opposition to President Vladimir V. Putin in the country’s vast hinterland, chanting “Putin Resign” and demanding the release of a regional governor arrested this past week on suspicion of multiple murders. The protests in Khabarovsk, a city bordering China, and several other towns were the largest in Russia’s usually somnolent provinces in many years, rivaling or even exceeding in size demonstrations last summer in Moscow, the main center of opposition to the Kremlin. Unlike streets protests in Moscow, which the authorities can easily discredit as the work of a privileged metropolitan elite led astray by Russia’s enemies in the West, the outburst of anger against Mr. Putin in a hardscrabble region nearly 4,000 miles east of the capital presented an unusual and potentially more troublesome challenge. The demonstrations in towns across Khabarovsk Krai, a sprawling region that stretches from the frontier with China to the Arctic along the Pacific Ocean, followed the arrest on Thursday of the region’s popular governor, Sergei I. Furgal. He is one of Russia’s few provincial leaders not affiliated with political forces entirely controlled by the Kremlin. Mr. Furgal, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of the nationalist rabble-rouser Vladimir Zhirinovsky, took office in 2018 after defeating a Kremlin-endorsed candidate. Despite his affiliation with a party scorned by Russian liberals as a collection of crackpots and crooks, he has now been embraced by many Kremlin critics as a victim of political repression by Mr. Putin. Aleksei A. Navalny, a Moscow-based anti-corruption campaigner and Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, cheered Saturday’s protests in the Far East, hailing the street demonstration in Khabarovsk as the “biggest in the city’s history.” Mr. Nalvalny tweeted a video of the protests and a message of support: “Far East, We Are With You!” The Ministry of Interior, which controls Russia’s regular police forces, estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 people had joined the protest in Khabarovsk. Local news outlets put the number at more than 40,000. State-controlled media ignored the protests while giving extensive coverage to troubles in the United States, particularly a spike in coronavirus cases. The focus on America’s problems instead of Russia’s Far East led Dmitri Alekseyev, a wealthy businessman in Vladivostok, a city east of Khabarovsk, to comment on Facebook that “it seems I am living in the U.S.A.” City authorities in Khabarovsk, the regional capital, tried to prevent the rally by sealing off the main square, claiming that it needed to be disinfected. But municipal police officers stood aside as crowds poured peacefully into the center of the city. Videos showed festive scenes of protesters, both young and old, waving signs in support of the arrested governor and chanting “Freedom for Furgal,” “Moscow Get Out” and “Putin Step Down.” Protests were also reported in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, an important industrial center, Solnechny and other towns in Khabarovsk Krai. A former timber and scrap metal trader, Mr. Furgal has long been trailed by accusations of criminality. But protesters said they were less concerned about his innocence or guilt and more concerned that his alleged crimes, ignored for nearly two decades by investigators, had suddenly been used to depose a governor who, unlike Mr. Putin, had won a real and competitive election. Appearing in court in Moscow on Friday, Mr. Furgal pleaded not guilty to charges of multiple murders and attempted murder in the early 2000s. His arrest now, so many years later, was widely seen as politically motivated, the latest heavy-handed strike in a rolling crackdown unleashed after a rigged national plebiscite on constitutional amendments effectively entrenched Mr. Putin as president for life. After seven days of voting, the electoral commission in Moscow last week announced that Mr. Putin had won what the Kremlin described as a “triumphant referendum on confidence.” More than 78 percent of voters endorsed amendments that allow Mr. Putin to crash through term limits previously mandated by the Constitution and stay in power until at least 2036. He was supposed to step down at the end of his current term in 2024. But Mr. Putin’s image as a can-do leader has been badly battered by his often passive response to the coronavirus pandemic and a deepening economic crisis. His approval rating has slumped in recent weeks to its lowest level since taking office more than 20 years ago. While other countries in Europe or East Asia have slowed the pace of new infections, Russia is seeing nearly 7,000 new cases a day. And it risks new spikes following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in Moscow and most other places ahead of Mr. Putin’s constitutional plebiscite and a huge military parade in Red Square. Few commentators expect street protests to snowball nationwide and force Mr. Putin to step down, not least because the Kremlin controls an immense security apparatus adept at crushing demonstrations. But events in Khabarovsk and angry grumbling across the country over growing economic hardship suggest that Mr. Putin has lost his aura as an invincible leader supported by a large majority of the public. Mr. Putin has for years faced periodic outbursts of street protests involving mostly young people in Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia’s biggest and wealthiest cities. But aided by relentless propaganda on state-controlled television and loyal security officers, Mr. Putin has swatted his critics away, sneering at them as spoiled troublemakers out of step with ordinary Russians in the provinces who have repeatedly re-elected him by ever-increasing margins. But none of those presidential elections, which have excluded would-be opposition candidates like Mr. Navlny, has come close to being free and fair, leaving the Kremlin reliant on secret opinion polls to gauge Mr. Putin’s real level of support. Protests in places like Khabarovsk provide a rare unfiltered view of what many people, including those with no connection to Mr. Putin’s inveterate critics in Moscow, might really think.

Ethiopia Announces Arrests in Prominent Singer’s Killing,2020-07-11,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Ethiopia has said that two men have been arrested in connection with the killing of Hachalu Hundessa, a well-known musician and activist whose death last month was followed by unrest in which hundreds were killed. Attorney General Adanech Abebe announced the arrests in a televised statement on Friday night, saying that a third suspect in Mr. Hundessa’s shooting was still on the run. “We will continue to uphold the rule of law,” Ms. Abebe said. She said the two men arrested had confessed to killing Mr. Hundessa, acting on the orders of an armed splinter wing of the Oromo Liberation Front, an opposition group, with the goal of inciting ethnic tension and overthrowing the government. She provided no evidence for the claim, and the Oromo Liberation Front had yet to respond to the accusation as of Saturday morning. Mr. Hundessa, 34, was shot on June 29 in a suburb of the capital, Addis Ababa. He was taken to a hospital but died of his wounds. The singer and activist was a member of Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, who have long been marginalized despite their numbers. His songs of resistance made him a hero to a generation of young people struggling for political and economic change. After his death, violent protests broke out in Addis Ababa and the neighboring Oromia region. Officials said that at least 239 people had been killed in the unrest, during which buildings were burned and groups of young men carried out ethnically motivated attacks. The government blocked the internet and arrested nearly 5,000 people, including activists, journalists and a prominent critic of the government, Jawar Mohammed. Tensions also escalated when the police blocked mourners from attending Mr. Hundessa’s funeral in his hometown, Ambo, 60 miles west of the capital. The violence has posed a challenge to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is overseeing Ethiopia’s delicate transition from authoritarian rule to multiparty democracy. Mr. Hundessa’s music provided a soundtrack to a wave of antigovernment protests that began in 2015, which eventually led to the resignation of the prime minister at the time, Hailemariam Desalegn, and the rise of Mr. Abiy, an Oromo himself. Since taking office in 2018, Mr. Abiy has introduced widespread political, economic and social overhauls, including amnesty for political prisoners and the legalization of banned opposition groups. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for such measures, and for restarting peace talks with neighboring Eritrea. But the changes brought about by Mr. Abiy have also lifted the lid on serious challenges to his government. He has faced criticism from members of the Oromo community who say he has not done enough to alleviate their problems. Mr. Abiy recently said that those who had killed Mr. Hundessa wanted to cause civil unrest and derail progress in Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous nation, after Nigeria. In a statement after the attorney general’s announcement, Mr. Abiy’s office asked members of the public for help in tracking down the third suspect and said that the government was committed to the overhauls.  “The government recognizes that this journey is tumultuous and filled with many obstacles, as structures, systems and networks that remained under the grip of authoritarianism are slowly being chiseled away,” the statement read, adding that, “political will at the highest level is anchored in establishing a just and democratic order that pays heed to equality and respect of fundamental rights and dignity of every citizen.” Leaders and officials around the world have called on Ethiopia to refrain from using disproportionate force in dealing with the recent protests. The United Nations Human Rights Office said it was “deeply concerned” about the violence, while the African Union chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat, appealed for restraint from all sides. Last week, hundreds of Oromo residents of Minnesota gathered in St. Paul to condemn Mr. Hundessa’s killing. Representative Ilhan Omar said on Twitter that she would “do everything in my power to ensure that the United States helps pursue justice for the killing of Hachalu Hundessa.”']","The shooting last month of Hachalu Hundessa, a hero to young Ethiopians calling for reform, was followed by unrest in which hundreds of people were killed."
Louisiana Orders Bars Closed and Masks for Most,2020-07-11,,"['This briefing has ended. Follow the latest news on the coronavirus outbreak. President Trump on Saturday wore a mask in public for the first time, after repeated urging from aides that it was a necessary message to send to Americans resistant to covering their faces. Mr. Trump wore a dark mask affixed with the presidential seal during a visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he planned to visit wounded troops. He was surrounded by Secret Service agents and others also wearing masks. Anticipation over whether he would wear a mask had been building, after the president had repeatedly dismissed suggestions that he wear a mask, frequently appearing in public spaces without one, mocking those who did and ignoring public health rules in several states. But as the pandemic has spread to states with large numbers of Republican voters, Mr. Trump had signaled more recently that he was more open to masks, and told reporters he planned to wear a mask on the visit to the medical center. Before going there, he stopped to speak with reporters at the White House. “I’ll probably have a mask, if you must know,” Mr. Trump said. “I think when you’re in a hospital, especially in that particular setting where you’re talking to a lot of soldiers and people that in some cases just got off the operating tables. I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask. I’ve never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place.” Weeks ago, the president took a mask off before seeing reporters during a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan, in violation of factory policy, which he said he did to avoid being photographed with it on. Last month he refused to wear a mask at a factory in Maine that produced coronavirus testing swabs, forcing the manufacturer to dump products made during a demonstration for the president. And in May, he did not wear a mask during a visit to a Honeywell mask factory in Phoenix, Ariz., despite signage in the building asking visitors and workers to do so at all times. Masks were scarce at recent Trump campaign events in Oklahoma, Arizona and South Dakota. In contrast to Mr. Trump’s reluctance, a growing number of governors, both Republican and Democratic, and even Vice President Mike Pence have taken up the cause in recent weeks. Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona and Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia are among the chorus of Republican officials who have encouraged their constituents to actively cover their faces in public. In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards on Saturday said almost all residents must wear a mask in public. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, recently issued a similar order. Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mitt Romney of Utah have also called on the president to wear face coverings, at least as a symbolic gesture. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also implored the president to wear one. In an interview this month, Mr. Trump said he “would wear one if I were in a group of people and I was close,” adding that he “sort of liked” the way he looked. “It was a dark black mask,” he said at the time, “and I thought it looked OK. I looked like the Lone Ranger.” As the national death toll mounts and the coronavirus continues its surge across the Sun Belt, the governor of Louisiana on Saturday ordered bars to close and most residents to wear a mask outside. The state had an early outbreak that then receded, before a recent spike in cases and hospitalizations. South Carolina announced its highest single-day total for coronavirus cases on Saturday, recording more than 2,200 infections; its previous record was set on July 4 with 1,854 new cases. More than 22 percent of tests in the state came back positive on Friday — the highest positivity rate for the state yet, according to health officials. North Carolina, Oregon, Arkansas, Hawaii and Alaska also recorded single-day highs Saturday. More than 60,000 new coronavirus cases were announced in the U.S. on Saturday, more than any day of the pandemic except Friday, when the country recorded more than 68,000 — setting a single-day record for the seventh time in 11 days. The country’s seven-day death average reached 642 on Friday, up from 471 on July 5, but still a fraction of the more than 2,200 deaths the country averaged each day in mid-April, when the outbreak in the Northeast was at its worst. And eight states set single-day death records this week: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Tennessee. South Carolina and Florida were among the first states to reopen and are now among the worst-hit states. Florida hit daily records twice in the last 10 days, and has surpassed 10,000 daily cases five times in that period, announcing 10,360 new infections on Saturday. In South Carolina, National Guard troops were expected to be called in to help hospitals in the state handle the increased strain on the health care system. The Department of Health and Environmental Control reported the first death of a child in the state, according to a news release. The child was younger than 5 and from the Midlands region of the state, according to the release, which did not otherwise identify the child. South Carolina has had more than 54,000 coronavirus cases and more than 950 deaths as of Saturday, according to a New York Times database. Gov. Henry McMaster announced that the sale of alcohol in all bars and restaurants would be prohibited after 11 p.m., beginning Saturday night. Mr. McMaster said he hoped the move would help reduce transmission among young adults. More than 20 percent of the state’s confirmed cases are in people ages 21 to 30, health officials said. Florida and Texas closed bars again last month, and bars across Las Vegas and Reno shut down for the second time at midnight on Friday. Public health experts have said the virus has spread quickly through bars because people linger, drink and often have to shout or get closer to hear each other over blaring music. Louisiana has more cases per capita than all but New York and New Jersey, and on Friday, the state recorded more than 2,600 positive tests, more than any day since April 2. “It’s become clear to me, especially after the numbers that we saw yesterday, that our current restrictions are not enough,” Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, said at a news conference announcing the order. He said that more than 10 percent of the people who were being tested were testing positive. The governor said that Louisianians over the age of 8 must wear a mask when they are not able to socially distance from other people, unless they have a health condition. Local parishes can opt out, but only if they hit certain requirements, Mr. Edwards said, noting that only three were in that position on Saturday. Several states and cities are rolling back their reopenings or even contemplating locking down again. In Texas, which reported record numbers of daily cases four times this week, Gov. Abbott signaled Friday the possibility of a new economic “lockdown” if the state cannot curtail its outbreak. In Georgia, Atlanta officials said Friday they were preparing to shift back to “Phase 1” guidelines, which call for residents to largely stay at home. Most of Georgia’s cases have been concentrated in the counties making up the Atlanta metropolitan area. In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said this week that emergency public health restrictions would be reinstated on Monday, including prohibitions on indoor dining and barring out-of-state visitors to New Mexico’s state parks.  More than 10,000 Israelis whose livelihoods have imploded because of the coronavirus erupted in rage over the government’s economic policies at a protest Saturday night that filled Rabin Square in downtown Tel Aviv. Actors, nightclub owners, hotel and domestic workers and people from countless other walks of life demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “get the money flowing,” likening their struggle to a war, but one for bread — a staple that is Israeli shorthand for economic anxieties. Masks were in abundance but distance between protesters was not. The police said they had authorized 1,800 people to attend the demonstration but the crowd overflowed the two-city-block plaza in front of City Hall. Mr. Netanyahu, whose management of the pandemic was already under assault — the infection is spreading in Israel faster than ever — had tried hard to defuse the protest in meetings on Friday, the Israeli news media reported. But its organizers refused to call it off. The unemployment rate is 21 percent, with more than 850,000 Israelis jobless. But differences in the way different categories of workers are protected are leaving the self-employed, small-business owners and unsalaried workers with far less of a safety net than those whose companies put them on unpaid leave. Mr. Netanyahu announced Thursday that the self-employed would receive more than $2,100 by next week, but protesters said earlier rounds of subsidies were too little and had arrived too late. “Enough with the lies!” read one sign. “We need the money now, not tomorrow,” said Avinoam Nehamad, who owns a tourism company, according to Walla News. In Serbia, thousands of protesters also demonstrated outside Parliament for the fourth consecutive night on Friday, ignoring a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. The rallies — set off by an announcement of since-aborted plans to reinstate a total lockdown in Belgrade, the capital — quickly evolved into protests over democratic backsliding in recent years under President Aleksandar Vucic, his approach to Kosovo, and the inconsistent and politicized ways in which his government has imposed social restrictions during the pandemic. At least 60 people on two Marine bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa have been infected with the coronavirus, according to Marine officials. A spokesman for the Marines said that commanders had enacted “soft shelter-in-place orders” at the bases, Camp Hansen and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, and that only essential personnel would be permitted to enter and leave those areas as the authorities sought to curb the spread of the virus. “Cleaning teams have been dispatched and thorough contact tracing is ongoing to identify and isolate those who may have come in contact with infected personnel,” a spokesman for the Marines, Major Kenneth Kunze, said in a statement on Saturday. A Marine familiar with the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that it was likely that the virus was transmitted to at least one of the bases after a unit recently deployed there in mid-June, part of the Marine Corps unit program that regularly sends troops to Okinawa to train and deploy throughout the region. It is believed that some of those deployed in the unit contracted the virus after sneaking off the base for July 4 celebrations, according to the Marine as well as a notice sent by a Marine official. “Okinawans are shocked by what we were told” by the U.S. military about the outbreak, the Okinawa governor, Denny Tamaki, told a news conference, according to The Associated Press. He questioned disease prevention measures taken by the U.S. military. GLOBAL ROUNDUP On a day when India reported more than 28,000 new coronavirus infections, one case in particular caught the whole country’s attention: Amitabh Bachchan, a Bollywood star and one of India’s most revered figures. Mr. Bachchan, known as Big B, announced on Saturday to his 43 million followers on Twitter that he had tested positive and urged his recent contacts to get tested themselves. His son, Abhishek, also an actor, disclosed that he was positive as well. Both appear to have only mild symptoms. India is now racking up more new reported infections each day than any other country except the United States and Brazil. It also has the third-highest total number of infections after those same two countries, with about 850,000 confirmed cases and more than 22,000 deaths. Hospitals in India are overflowing to the point that pregnant women have died in labor after being turned away. The surge in cases has led officials around India to reimpose restrictions after attempting to loosen things up to stimulate a critically wounded economy. The borders between states are being rigorously patrolled, and international travel is still closed. But the density of India’s population makes it difficult to practice social distancing in cities like Mumbai, home to Mr. Bachchan. It’s hard to overstate how big Big B really is, having appeared in more than 200 films over the past 50 years. “He’s like god,” said Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, a filmmaker who has worked with him. “I’ve never seen a star having such power, such credibility. He’s the biggest superstar this country has ever, ever seen.” Mr. Bachchan’s illness might create more fear across India. But Mr. Dungarpur predicted that many Indians would find his struggle inspiring and say to themselves: “If Amitabh Bachchan can fight this, so can we.” Other developments around the world: Australian citizens and residents traveling from overseas to New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, will be charged for their mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine starting July 18, the state premier said on Sunday. Everyone whose airline ticket was purchased after July 12 will have to pay 3,000 Australian dollars, or about $2,100, for the first adult, 1,000 dollars for each additional adult, and 500 dollars for each child 3 or older. Mandatory hotel quarantines at a similar cost to international arrivals are already in effect in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and other parts of the country are likely to begin charging travelers as well amid a new outbreak in Melbourne, Australia’s second-biggest city. On Friday, Australia said it would halve the number of people permitted to return each week to 4,000 from about 8,000. The border has been closed to nonresidents since March. Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing who has criticized the Chinese government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, was released from detention on Sunday, a week after the police took him away. In Hong Kong, a Department of Health spokeswoman said on Saturday that the latest outbreak in the semiautonomous Chinese territory was worse than an earlier peak in March because of a growing number of cases with unknown origins and growing clusters linked to housing estates, homes for older people and restaurants. Hong Kong recorded 28 new infections and 33 preliminary positive cases on Saturday, after a spike this week. In France, the widow of a bus driver who was beaten to death after he asked four passengers to wear masks is demanding “exemplary punishment” for his attackers, The Associated Press reported on Saturday. Four people are in custody in relation to the July 5 attack on the driver, Philippe Monguillot, at a bus stop in the city of Bayonne. Mr. Monguillot had been hospitalized in critical condition, and his death was announced on Friday. His wife, Veronique Monguillot, said in a meeting with the French interior minister that she and their three daughters had been “destroyed” by the attack. “We must bang a fist on the table, so this never happens again,” she said.  Thousands of theme park fans turned out — in masks in the scorching Florida heat and amid a virus surge — for the reopening of Walt Disney World, a place designed to chase your troubles away. After closing in March because of the pandemic, the mega-resort near Orlando began tossing confetti again at 9 a.m. Two of its four major parks, the Magic Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom, welcomed back a limited number of temperature-checked visitors, with some attractions and character interactions unavailable as safety precautions. Epcot and Disney’s Hollywood Studios were set to reopen on Wednesday. It amounted to a breathtaking effort by a corporation to prove that it can safely operate — entertaining families and employing tens of thousands of workers — at a highly dangerous time. Other amusement parks are also opening. Dorney Park in Pennsylvania and Cedar Point in Ohio also announced they would open to all guests on Saturday, after exclusively allowing season pass holders for several days. SeaWorld Orlando also resumed operating its rides and marine exhibits on Saturday. The reality of whether Disney succeeds in keeping its guests and employees safe will become clear in the weeks to come. Demand is also a question, especially since Disney World draws much of its attendance from the Northeast. Earlier in the week, negative commentary about the reopening flooded Twitter. People used words like “irresponsible” and “disappointed” to describe Disney’s decision to stick to its reopening plans, announced in May, even as coronavirus cases surged. There are 49 state governments that report the home county of people who die from the coronavirus. And then there is Kansas, which refuses to do so. There are 49 state governments that update their coronavirus case totals at least five times a week. And then there is Kansas, which forgoes updates on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends. As Kansas’ case numbers surge to record levels — more than 4,000 infections have been announced already this month, including spikes around Wichita, Lawrence and the Kansas City suburbs — the state sticks out for its opacity. Since early in the pandemic, Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration has refused to release the names of meatpacking plants tied to thousands of cases, citing privacy concerns. In neighboring Colorado and Missouri, state officials have provided detailed accounts of similar outbreaks. Officials at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment use the same reason — patient privacy — for refusing to say which of the state’s 105 counties are reporting coronavirus deaths. All other states have long provided county-level death details. In Kansas, it is up to local officials to decide whether to release that information. The state government has stuck by its policies even as outbreaks have emerged at Kansas bars, churches and colleges, and as officials in several counties have overturned Ms. Kelly’s order requiring masks. Until mid-May, Kansas updated its public data every day, like almost every other state. But for nearly two months, state-level updates have come only three times a week. That has left Kansans with less frequent information at the same time that Republicans in the state have tried to curb the emergency authority of Ms. Kelly, a Democrat, and as officials in many counties have disregarded her reopening plan. Kristi Zears, a state health department spokeswoman, said the decision to cut back on public updates allowed officials to focus on other aspects of the coronavirus response, and that it had not slowed the pace of case investigations. “With the increasing number of outbreaks and increasing requests from local health departments to assist with case investigations and contact tracing, we shifted more focus on assisting counties,” Ms. Zears said in an email. As school districts across the United States consider whether and how to restart in-person classes, they face two fundamental uncertainties: No nation has tried to send children back to school with the virus raging at levels like America’s, and the scientific research about transmission in classrooms is limited. The World Health Organization has concluded that the virus is airborne in crowded, indoor spaces with poor ventilation, a description that fits many American schools, and many of the country’s 3.5 million teachers are feeling under siege, under pressure from the White House, pediatricians and some parents to resume normal teaching. “I’m just going to say it: It feels like we’re playing Russian roulette with our kids and our staff,” said Robin Cogan, a nurse at the Yorkship School in Camden, N.J., who serves on the state’s committee on reopening schools. Three science reporters for The Times, Pam Belluck, Apoorva Mandavilli and Benedict Carey, reviewed relevant studies from around the world. The data, they write, clearly shows that children are far less likely than adults to become seriously ill from the virus. And some research suggests younger children are less likely than teenagers to infect others, though the evidence is not conclusive. Countries like Norway and Denmark reopened schools after reducing infection levels, and have not seen a surge in cases. They initially opened only for younger children, strengthened sanitizing procedures, and have kept class size limited, children in small groups at recess and space between desks. The larger concern is that children could become infected, many with no symptoms, and then spread the virus to others, including family members, teachers and other school employees. In Israel, the virus infected more than 200 students and staff after schools reopened in early May and lifted limits on class size a few weeks later, according to a report by University of Washington researchers. On the other hand, a study in Ireland of six infected people — two high school students, an elementary student and three adults — who spent time in schools before they closed in March found that the only documented transmission involved one of the adults, and outside of school. When California shut down its economy in March, it became a model for painful but aggressive action to counter the virus. The implicit trade-off was that a lot of upfront pain would help slow the spread, allowing the state to reopen sooner and more triumphantly than places that failed to act as decisively. But the virus had other plans. California is now averaging about 8,000 new cases a day, and the state’s economy is in retrenchment mode again. Unemployment, which was 3.9 percent in February, the lowest on record, shot up to 16.3 percent by May, compared with 13.3 percent nationwide. Container traffic at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach is down about a third from a year ago, while many beaches and attractions like Disneyland were closed on July Fourth and are delaying their reopening plans. Most dispiriting is the sense that even after politicians made tough calls that Californians largely supported, the economy seems no better off. Andrew Snow, who owns the Golden Squirrel, a restaurant and bar in Oakland’s Rockridge neighborhood, cut his staff of 28 people to two after the pandemic hit. But thanks to takeout orders, a new line of business selling groceries and the resumption of outdoor service, he recently brought two back, and was set to bump that figure to six or eight by the July Fourth weekend. But business is slowing again, as California is averaging about 8,000 new cases a day, about triple the level a month ago. Mr. Snow’s plans to bring back workers over the holiday weekend didn’t come to pass, and he has put further hiring on hold. “People are scared,” he said. “The math for having more people doesn’t work out anymore.” A Scottish pilot in Vietnam who spent more than two months on life support after contracting Covid-19 and became the subject of nationwide public interest was released from the hospital on Saturday and headed to the airport for his return home. The case of the pilot, Stephen Cameron, 43, has come to exemplify Vietnam’s all-out effort to beat the coronavirus, with the state news media in the Communist country covering his treatment extensively. Mr. Cameron was so seriously ill at one point that doctors contemplated a double lung transplant. “I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the Vietnamese people, the dedication and professionalism of the doctors,” Mr. Cameron said before his departure, in a video released by Cho Ray Hospital, where he was treated. “The odds say that I shouldn’t be here, and so I can only thank everybody here for doing what they have done.” Vietnam has been among the most successful countries in tackling the virus. It is the largest country not to have reported a single Covid-19 death. No cases of local transmission have been reported since mid-April. And just 369 cases in total have been confirmed in the country of more than 97 million people. Known as Patient 91, Mr. Cameron arrived in Ho Chi Minh City in February to take a job with Vietnam Airlines. He tested positive for the virus in March after visiting a bar that emerged as the center of Vietnam’s biggest coronavirus cluster. Doctors at Cho Ray Hospital, in Ho Chi Minh City, said he was now free of the virus. But he faces a long recovery period after spending two months in a medically induced coma. A Facebook video posted by the hospital on July 3 showed him lying in bed surrounded by doctors and other workers, who applauded his progress as he answered simple questions and tested the strength in his legs. The German soccer club Union Berlin wants its fans back, and soon. And to do so, it plans to offer free coronavirus tests to more than 20,000 fans so they can fill up its stadium’s seats when the next season starts in September. From setting up contact tracing to allowing a limited amount of fans in stands, clubs across Europe have studied various alternatives to let people watch their teams play in stadiums. If carried out, Union Berlin’s plan would be a first. The club said ticket holders would have to test negative for the coronavirus within 24 hours of the game and bring the test’s result along with their ticket. When most European countries were in the early stages of the pandemic, some soccer games in late February and early March contributed to the spread of the virus, before leagues suspended their seasons — or canceled them altogether. With games now played behind closed doors, stadiums have been depleted of those who once made them roar and bristle with life. And for many, the financial loss caused by the absence of tickets sales is critical. Most of the 22,000 seats in Union Berlin’s stadium are terraces on which fans stand close together, so social distancing is not feasible, the club’s president, Dirk Zingler, said in a statement announcing the free coronavirus tests. “And if we aren’t allowed to sing and shout, then it’s not Union,” he said. Beyond the logistics and cost of providing over 20,000 tests several times a month, the club may run into other obstacles: Large gatherings are banned in Berlin until Oct. 24, and even with tests, crowds could prove risky. In Switzerland, FC Zurich had to postpone two games after it said on Saturday that several members of its staff and at least one player had tested positive for the coronavirus, in what may await other teams as they finish the current season. On an afternoon in early April, while New York City was in the throes of what would be the deadliest days of the pandemic, Dr. Lorna M. Breen found herself alone in the still of her apartment in Manhattan. She picked up her phone and dialed her younger sister, Jennifer Feist, as she did nearly every day. Lately, their conversations had been bleak. Dr. Breen, 49, supervised the emergency department at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital in Upper Manhattan. The unit had become a brutal battleground, with supplies depleting at a distressing rate and doctors — herself among them — and nurses falling ill. The waiting room was perpetually overcrowded. The sick were dying unnoticed. When Dr. Breen called this time, she sounded odd. Her voice was distant, as if she was in shock. “I don’t know what to do,” she said. “I can’t get out of the chair.” Her sister helped to get her into a psychiatric ward. More than 50 family members, friends and current and former colleagues told Dr. Breen’s story to three reporters for The Times: Corina Knoll, Ali Watkins and Michael Rothfeld. They painted a picture of a consummate overachiever. Gifted, confident, clever. Unflappable. She planned thrilling trips, joined a ski club, played cello in an orchestra, took salsa classes and attended Redeemer Presbyterian, a church that attracted high-achieving professionals. Once a year, she gathered all her social circles at a party on her rooftop. In late February, when elected leaders were still assuring the public that the virus did not pose a serious threat, she became convinced it would catch hospitals off guard. And it did, inundating emergency rooms like hers with desperately ill people. There would be bodies every day. Ultimately, during the worst of the crisis, almost a quarter of the people who were admitted to the Allen to be treated for Covid-19 would die. On April 26, Dr. Breen killed herself. Her family believes she should be counted among the pandemic’s casualties. That she was destroyed by the sheer number of people she could not save. That she was mortified to have cried for help. “Lorna kept saying, ‘I think everybody knows I’m struggling,’” her sister said. “She was so embarrassed.” The New York State Department of Health announced on Friday that residents in certain nursing homes would be allowed to have visitors, after being all but cut off to outside guests during the early months of the pandemic. New York originally barred visitors at nursing homes on March 13 over fears they would spread the virus among older people, whom epidemiologists consider to be at an elevated risk of developing life-threatening complications. To date, about 42 percent of deaths in the United States have been linked to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, including more than 6,400 residents or staff members in New York. The toll in New York nursing homes accounts for more than one-tenth of the reported deaths in such facilities across the country. Only those facilities that have gone without any new coronavirus cases among residents and staff for at least 28 days will be eligible to receive visitors, according to the announcement. Even then, only 10 percent of residents at eligible facilities will be allowed to host visitors at the same time. Residents can have visits from up to two individuals at a time, one of whom must be at least 18 years of age. Visitors also will be asked to go through a familiar array of health screenings, including temperature checks at entrances, and to wear face coverings and socially distance while inside. A spokeswoman for the Health Department said that roughly 150 of the more than 600 nursing homes in New York could soon qualify to accept visitors, according to a report from The Associated Press. While most New Yorkers grudgingly accepted New York City’s lockdown in March, one community eagerly embraced it: graffiti writers. Deserted commercial streets with gated storefronts offered thousands of blank canvases. From the South Bronx to East New York, a new generation of graffiti writers has emerged, many of whom have never hit a trainyard or the inside of a subway car. But like early taggers who grew up in a city beset by crime, grime and empty coffers, today’s generation is dealing with its own intense fears over the devastating effects of the coronavirus on communities and the economy. “Does art dictate the times or do the times dictate art?” said John Matos, 58, a graffiti writer known as Crash who started out in the 1970s. “Before now, the streets were sanitized, with pieces that were cool and nice, and done with permission. Now, we’re back to the roots.” Concerns over the virus, as well as the death of George Floyd and others at the hands of the police, have been reflected in the pieces showing up around the city. But a lot of the new tags around town are, on their face, apolitical, though the mere act of writing on a wall is a political statement in itself. “The whole thing with quarantine is that people feel powerless because daily life and activity is very different,” said Eric Felisbret, the author of “Graffiti New York,” who took up aerosol art as a teenager on the Lower East Side. “They can’t control anything. But they can get out there and bomb — that’s something they can control.” Because of the pandemic, the Treasury Department postponed the traditional April 15 federal tax filing deadline until July 15 — and this time there is no wiggle room. Last month, the Internal Revenue Service said there would not be another blanket filing delay. So for anyone who has not yet filed a return — or filed but not yet paid the taxes owed for 2019 — the deadline is Wednesday. “It’s just like April 15, but in July,” said Cindy Hockenberry, the director of tax research and government relations for the National Association of Tax Professionals, a trade group. Not long ago, Colombia and Latin America more broadly were in the middle of a history-making transformation: The scourge of inequality was shrinking like never before. Over the past 20 years, millions of families had marched out of poverty in one of the most unequal regions on Earth. The gap between rich and poor in Latin America fell to its lowest point on record. Now, the pandemic is threatening to reverse those gains like nothing else in recent history, economists say, potentially upending politics and entire societies for years to come. To document this critical moment, two Times reporters, Julie Turkewitz and Sofía Villamil, and a photographer, Federico Rios, traveled more than 1,000 miles across Colombia. Throughout the journey, they witnessed a swift collapse of prosperity. Small businesses had closed for good. Universities were hemorrhaging students. Schools that had turned the children of construction workers into engineers were near collapse, unable to pay teachers. Farmers were burning their crops, ruined by disrupted markets. Parents began rationing medicine to their children, unsure when they would have money for more. Yet while some families sold their cellphones to buy dinner, wealthy people retreated to countryside homes. “It was never my dream to go backward,” said David Aguirre, 32, who had risen from a low-level bodyguard to the boss of his own strawberry farm. “The sacrifice of many people, days of work from 6 to 6 at night, rain, sun. And then — for it all to become nothing?” The number of food-insecure New York City residents has doubled to about two million since the onset of the pandemic. But just as quickly as the need escalated, so, too, did new solutions. Those who help feed the hungry are up early, clipboards in hand, checking on deliveries. They work the phones, begging for donations. They direct employees and a growing army of volunteers. And they try to keep their wits about them, despite the long hours, the long to-do lists and the long lines that are becoming all too common. Red Rabbit, a Harlem-based company that was founded in 2005 by the Wall Street equities trader Rhys Powell to provide meals for schoolchildren, was serving 22,000 meals and snacks a day when schools were shut down in March. Since then, Red Rabbit has started making meals for adults for the first time, with meals distributed to emergency workers, their children and others in the community. Now, 90,000 meals are prepared weekly. And in late March, the Rev. Andrew Marko, the pastor of Evangel Church in Queens, converted the 100,000-square-foot building that houses the church and shuttered school into a mammoth operation to feed those in need. Pastor Marko is constantly on the phone to chase down donations. “I’m the food crier,” he said, marveling at how the effort has taken on a life of its own. “I feel like I’m on the back of a speedboat and not sure who’s driving.” Yet the results are profound. “We’ve moved almost three million pounds of food since the crisis started,” Pastor Marko said. Museums and production companies are offering many online options.

"How Russia Built a Channel to the Taliban, Once an Enemy",2020-07-13,By Mujib Mashal and Michael Schwirtz,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — During one of the most violent stretches of fighting in northern Afghanistan, as the Taliban scored victories that had eluded them since the beginning of the conflict, the top American commander went public with a suspicion that had nagged for years: Russia was aiding the insurgents. In diplomatic circles in Kabul around the time of that accusation, in 2017, there were murmurs that the Russian assistance had included night-vision goggles and armor-piercing ammunition. But Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander, offered no definitive evidence, and that spoke to how confusing the battlefield had become as three longtime adversaries — the Taliban, Russia and Iran — agreed on their common interest in seeing the Americans leave Afghanistan. In the maze of corruption, cash and foreign hands in Afghanistan, it was no easy task to pin down who was doing what. “We’ve had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and said, ‘This was given by the Russians to the Taliban,’” General Nicholson said a year later. “We know that the Russians are involved.” The recent revelation of an American intelligence assessment that Russia had provided the Taliban with bounties to attack U.S. and coalition troops stunned political leaders in Washington and added a potent dose of Cold War-style skulduggery to deliberations over Afghanistan’s future. Both Russia and the Taliban have rejected the assertion. But while that would be a notable escalation of Russian interference in Afghanistan, it was clear to many officials that Russia had been working to hedge its bets with the Taliban for years. The Russians saw the Afghan government as entirely controlled by the United States, and at worst so fragile that it would struggle to survive the U.S. withdrawal. In interviews, Afghan and American officials and foreign diplomats with years of experience in Kabul say that what began as a diplomatic channel between Russia and the Taliban just under a decade ago has more recently blossomed into a mutually beneficial alliance that has allowed the Kremlin to reassert its influence in the region. The shift coincided with increasing hostility between the United States and Russia over Syria’s civil war and other conflicts, analysts say, as well as Russia’s frustration with rising instability in Afghanistan and the slow pace of the U.S. pullout. Now, the United States is conducting the troop withdrawal it agreed to with the Taliban even without a final peace deal between the insurgents and the Afghan government which the Americans have supported for years. But Russia’s covert efforts, officials and analysts say, are aimed at harassing and embarrassing the United States as the troops leave rather than profoundly changing the course of the conflict. “It was in modest quantities; it was not designed to be a game-changer on the battlefield,” General Nicholson, who has since retired from the military, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday about Russian arms and aid to the Taliban. “For example, the Taliban wanted surface-to-air missiles, the Russians didn’t give it to them. So I always concluded that their support to the Taliban was calibrated in some sense.” Some pointed out the considerably more extensive American efforts to support the mujahedeen insurgency against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. “We did the same,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. field officer in Afghanistan who retired last year as the agency’s acting chief of operations in Europe and Eurasia. “We turned the heat up as the Russians were leaving Afghanistan.” “Putin,” he said, “is a student of history.” As things began turning on the battlefield in recent years, officials described increasing suspicions of a greater Russian role in helping the Taliban. But they often struggled to pin down specifics, other than occasional influxes of new weapons and munitions that could have had several sources. In addition to Pakistan’s well-established support to the Taliban, Iran was taking a greater hand in helping the insurgents, and often using similar channels as the Russians, Afghan intelligence officials say. The dots began connecting more clearly during a stretch of alarming violence in northern Afghanistan, when the Taliban twice overran Kunduz city, a provincial capital, in 2015 and 2016, sending the U.S. military scrambling.  As Afghan intelligence narrowed in on the ambitious regional Taliban commander behind those assaults, they tracked his travel back and forth across the nearby border with Tajikistan, a Russian intelligence stronghold, according to current and former senior Afghan security officials. Kunduz is also the base of operations for two Afghan businessmen who American intelligence officials say acted as middlemen in the bounty scheme between Russian intelligence officers and Taliban fighters. U.S. officials say they confronted Russia about its aid to the Taliban on several occasions, but their public claims lacked detail, and it never amounted to a major issue. Russian officials said they received no documented evidence. Three decades after the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia’s cultural, economic and personal ties in the country remain deep. When Russia has looked to exert influence, whether benign or otherwise, it has had a host of friends to call on: Soviet-trained generals who led the Afghan forces for years on American pay; businessmen who bragged of friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia; politicians who kept homes in Moscow even as they grew rich on American contracts. For much of the first decade of the war, the United States did not really have to worry about the deep Russian reach into Afghan society, as Mr. Putin’s government was aligned with the American mission of defeating Al Qaeda and Islamist groups that Moscow also saw as a threat — including the Taliban. Diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks show genuine attempts by both sides to coordinate efforts in Afghanistan. Russian officials spoke of a “collective fist” in the fight against terrorism, and urged unity “with one voice — the American voice.” But as the war in Afghanistan dragged on, and the two powers took opposing sides in the crises in Syria and Ukraine, the Russians increasingly saw the U.S. mission as failed, and the American presence in the region as a threat. American intelligence officials now date Russia’s discreet outreach to the Taliban as beginning about eight years ago — around the time that Mr. Putin, after a four-year hiatus as prime minister, reassumed the presidency with a more confrontational posture with the West. The mistrust soon became intense enough that Russian officials accused the United States of playing a hand in the rise of an Islamic State chapter in Afghanistan around 2015, with many of its earliest fighters being extremist militants from Central Asia who yearned to bring a holy war against Russia. At a meeting of the Russian Security Council in 2013, Mr. Putin said his country could no longer stand by in the face of failures by the United States and its partners. “We need a clear action strategy, which will take into account different possible developments,” Mr. Putin said at the meeting. “The task is to reliably protect the interests of Russia under any circumstances.” Leading the portfolio on the diplomatic front was Zamir Kabulov, a veteran of the Soviet war in Afghanistan and reportedly a former Russian intelligence operative.  Mr. Kabulov began publicly criticizing the United States for weaknesses in the Afghan government and for failing to rein in Islamist militancy there — and increasingly describing the Afghan Taliban as a national entity that posed no threat beyond the country’s borders and could be worked with. Reports increased about Taliban figures making trips to Russia. And just as the United States and Taliban were finalizing details of the American withdrawal, Russia brought the same Taliban leaders into Moscow meetings with a large number of Afghan political figures for discussions over the political future of the country. As the United States has drawn down its military presence, it has increasingly relied on Afghan partners for intelligence and counterintelligence. What Afghan security officials were seeing in recent years, particularly in the north, was a deeply messy reality. Around the time they began focusing more on Russian activities, the Afghans also unraveled an Iranian scheme of distributing arms to discontented warlords and militia commanders — the weapons were Russian, and the route was through Tajikistan, officials said. The Iranian scheme was short-lived, one senior Afghan official said, after Iran realized the weapons it was providing were turning up in the saturated black market. The Russians often used the hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel imports for NATO and Afghan forces as a way to inject cash into Afghanistan to ensure influence and keep intelligence assets on their side. One former senior Afghan official said that instead of direct cash transfers, the Russians would mostly arrange for the convoys of oil tankers snaking into Afghanistan to be topped with extra fuel that would be cashed for circulation inside the country. Though the countries of Central Asia gained their independence after the Soviet collapse, Russia has never let go of its foothold in the region. In one cable, a Russian diplomat described the borders of countries like Tajikistan, where the Russian Air Force still has about 7,000 troops, as “an extension of its own border.” When the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan in 1990s, Tajikistan was a hub for the resistance commanders who received aid from Russia and Iran. In the 20 years since the U.S. invasion, the country has become a center of criminal traffic and vice, a kind of adult playground for many of the Afghan elite who frequently travel back and forth to Tajikistan and often have family there. In that mix of spies, money and mafia, the Taliban, too, found a foothold. The insurgents made a point of taking and maintaining control of some of the border crossings from Kunduz Province into Tajikistan. From the south of the country all the way to the north, they had border access to evade military pressure, maintain ties with friendly foreigners and keep a channel for the opium trade that partly finances the insurgency. Several Afghan officials, including Asadullah Omarkhel, who was the governor of Kunduz at the time, said they shared with the Americans intelligence that Mullah Abdul Salam, the Taliban commander who led the assaults on Kunduz, repeatedly crossed into Tajikistan for what they suspected were discussions with Russian agents. A Tajik news outlet reported meetings between Russian officials and Taliban commanders at a Russian air base in Tajikistan as early as 2015. And it was these border crossings that the Taliban used to bring weapons in, officials say. Mr. Omarkhel said Americans initially were not confident about claims of Taliban ties to Russia, but then they started striking the Taliban bases along the border, including a strike that killed Mullah Salam. At Thursday’s congressional hearing, General Nicholson repeated his accusation of Russia arming the Taliban, noting that even though the aid was not extensive, it still had effect. “In the northern part of Afghanistan, in particular in Kunduz, the Russian assistance did help the Taliban inflict higher casualties on the Afghan security forces and more hardship on the Afghan people,” he said. Najim Rahim, Eric Schmitt and Taimoor Shah contributed reporting.']","The recent assessment that Russia paid bounties to the insurgents to attack U.S. troops stunned many, but officials said the Kremlin’s outreach began almost a decade ago."
"For 20 Years, His Firm Called Him Antoine. Now Mohamed Is Suing.",2020-07-11,By Aurelien Breeden,"[""PARIS — Mohamed Amghar was a 40-year-old software salesman in the final stages of interviewing for a new job in November 1996 when, in his telling, his future boss made a request that left him speechless. You’ll have to change your name to “Antoine,” the man said, even specifying, according to Mr. Amghar, not to use ‘‘Philippe’’ because there were already two in the office. Mr. Amghar felt he had no choice. Still, he was ashamed — and angry. “It’s a betrayal,” said Mr. Amghar, born in Paris to Algerian parents who arrived there in 1946, when Algeria was still part of France. “You are made to understand, at 40 years old, that ‘No, Mohamed, you aren’t truly French like everyone else.’” And so, Mohamed became Antoine — on his email address, on his business card, on train and plane tickets, on name tags used at industry conferences, even on performance awards he collected over two decades at the company, Intergraph, an American software firm with French offices in Rungis, south of Paris. Mr. Amghar, now 63 and retired, sued the company last year in a labor court in Créteil, south of Paris, accusing it of discrimination and moral harassment and asking for more than 440,000 euros, or nearly $500,000, in damages. The court held a hearing in March but won’t rule until next year. The case has stood out because few racial discrimination suits reach French courts. And it resonates powerfully as France reckons with its colonial past, racism in the police and attitudes toward racial discrimination more generally in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis. Jacques Toubon, France’s human rights ombudsman, noted this month in a landmark report that studies and official statistics were unequivocal on the extent and “systemic nature” of discrimination in France. “People of a foreign origin or who are perceived as such are more exposed to unemployment, social insecurity, bad housing conditions and poorer health,” he wrote. At the time Mr. Amghar says his boss requested that he use a different name, he had been assured of the position but had not yet signed a contract, and he had already quit his old job. He was divorced with three children — the oldest was 13 at the time. “And I was not stupid,” Mr. Amghar said in an interview at his lawyer’s office in Paris. “I knew that being called Mohamed wasn’t the best passport, not only to get interviews but also a job.” Mr. Amghar says that, relatively speaking, he was fortunate even to get the job given France’s record of discrimination. The sales manager position involved selling engineering software to energy or chemical companies like Total or Arkema and was well-paid. He also acknowledges that he never filed an official complaint over his time at Intergraph, from 1997 to 2017. “I thought to myself: ‘You didn’t say anything in the beginning, what are you going to say now?’” he said. Intergraph, based in Alabama and bought in 2010 by Hexagon AB, a Swedish firm, did not deny that Mr. Amghar used a different name at the office, but said it had found no proof that management had requested the change. Hexagon’s PPM division, which includes Intergraph, said in an email that after receiving Mr. Amghar’s complaint in 2018, it had conducted an “internal investigation” that involved reviewing documents and speaking with current or former employees. But the company said it had “found no evidence of discrimination or that Intergraph France management required Mr. Amghar to change his name, or otherwise required Mr. Amghar to use the name of ‘Antoine’ when representing the company.” “Intergraph has always adhered to a strict standard of ethics and professional conduct in order to prevent all types of discrimination, racism and harassment, which are subjects it takes very seriously,” the company said. Hiring discrimination against Arab or Black minorities in France is widely documented. One recent study where fake applications were submitted to more than 100 blue-chip companies found that candidates with Arab-sounding names were nearly 20 percent less likely to get an answer than those with traditional French ones. “In all the studies that have been done in France, you find significant discriminations based on origin, whether Arab or Black,” said Yannick L’Horty, an economist who led the study with a team of researchers who specialize in assessing labor discriminations and the impact of public policies in the job market. Mr. Amghar’s case is unusual because he was, in fact, hired — which Intergraph is eager to point out. A lawyer representing the company in France declined to comment. But in 2018, responding to a letter from Mr. Amghar’s lawyer that threatened to file a suit barring “amicable reparation,” the firm called the accusations of discrimination “surprising” because Mr. Amghar had been “recruited by Intergraph and stayed there for 20 years.” In the letter, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, the company said that Mr. Amghar’s former boss — who no longer works at Intergraph — did not remember asking him to change names, adding that “one cannot exclude the possibility” that Mr. Amghar himself had chosen ‘‘Antoine.’’ Mr. Amghar, who is meticulously organized, has kept business cards, pay stubs, emails, contracts, security clearance documents, awards, and more, all featuring the name “Antoine.” And while there is no record of the November 1996 interview, Mr. Amghar bristles at the suggestion that he would have intentionally put himself in the awkward position of using two different names. He was once stopped at an airport because his passport didn’t match tickets booked by the company. In  meetings or emails, senior managers sometimes used Antoine while colleagues used Mohamed. On pay slips, he was ‘‘Mohamed Antoine.’’ One award from 2010 even used ‘‘Antoine (Mohamed) Amghar.’’ Mr. Amghar’s closest colleagues quickly learned the truth. But others said they were stunned to discover, months or even years after first meeting him, that Antoine was, in fact, Mohamed. Raoul Tardy, a retiree who worked for Intergraph in Norway from 1991 to 2015, said that Mr. Amghar was introduced to him as Antoine. For several years, that was the name he used on the phone or at meetings. “In the phone directory, it was Antoine. On the business card, it was Antoine. On the organizational chart, it was Antoine. It was Antoine everywhere,” Mr. Tardy said. Then, in the early 2000s on a bus ride during a company gathering in Austria, he overheard colleagues call Mr. Amghar ‘‘Momo,'’ a nickname for Mohamed. Mr. Amghar told him the truth. “I didn’t fall from my seat, but almost,” said Mr. Tardy, one of several former Intergraph employees who submitted written testimonies supporting Mr. Amghar in his suit. “What really shocked me is that none of the French managers tried to fix the problem.” Mr. Amghar is cheerful and quick to joke, but some of his sarcasm hints at deep resentment. For his managers, a man of Arab origin in his position was “inconceivable,” he said. “Mohamed can’t sign a 12 million euro contract and chat with the C.E.O. of a company,” Mr. Amghar said in mock outrage. “It’s not possible!” Frédéric Blas, a former colleague who was an in-house lawyer at Intergraph France from 2011 to 2016, said Mr. Amghar “felt humiliated. There was a real bitterness, a frustration.” There were no explicit instructions from senior managers to use the name Antoine, Mr. Blas said, but that was the name heard and used by those who didn’t work very closely with Mr. Amghar. It was “unsettling,” Mr. Blas added, and sometimes difficult for him not to use Antoine by force of habit. Galina Elbaz, Mr. Amghar’s lawyer, who also works for the International League Against Racism and anti-Semitism — a French civil rights group that has taken interest in his case — said that criminal discrimination cases are rarely prosecuted. “It’s five to six cases a year, barely,” Ms. Elbaz said, adding that often the victims are poor, working, and reluctant to spend months or years, and thousands of euros in lawyer fees, on an uncertain outcome. Mr. Toubon, the human rights ombudsman, noted in his report that among those who had reported personal cases of job discrimination to his office, only 12 percent had taken legal action. Victims do not always have hard proof of the mistreatment, the report noted, and many of them are reluctant to disrupt their professional lives by taking their employer to court. In labor courts — like the one handling Mr. Amghar’s case — there are precedents in his favor. But cases often drag on, Ms. Elbaz said, as the judges are not professional magistrates and aren’t always well versed in anti-discrimination law. Still, Mr. Amghar said it was important for him to file the suit. He recalled his father’s account of racism suffered in Algeria and then in France as a carpentry worker, and he remembered his parents’ faith that French meritocracy would give their children a different experience. “If people like me, who did what was necessary to get good jobs, to get training, to live as citizens, are besmirched and denied our rights, where are we going?” Mr. Amghar said animatedly. “I only have one name, I only have one nationality,” he added. “My name is Mohamed, and I am French.”""]","Mohamed Amghar, a retired software sales manager in France, has filed a discrimination complaint against his former employer, accusing the company of making him use a traditional French name at work."
"Caught Between Indian and Chinese Troops, at 15,000 Feet",2020-07-11,By Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — First it was cellphone towers, new roads and surveillance cameras, popping up on the Chinese side of the disputed Himalayan border with India.Then it was more run-ins between troops on each side, pushing, shoving and eventually getting into fistfights.Then, about three years ago, Indian soldiers spotted their Chinese foes carrying iron bars with little numbers written on them — a weapon apparently issued as standard gear, and a sign that the Chinese were gearing up for hand-to-hand combat.“This is how China operates,” said J.P. Yadav, a recently retired official with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, on the Indian side. “These are very planned things.”Now, weeks after a deadly brawl erupted along the border, thousands of Chinese and Indian troops are amassed over a contentious, jagged line in one of the most remote places on earth. Satellite photos reveal a major Chinese buildup, including a blizzard of new tents, new storage sheds, artillery pieces and even tanks. Each country has accused the other of provocative actions along the murky border. But according to people who live and work in the region, Ladakh, a Chinese push into Indian territory has been building for years. The area, high up in the Himalayas, has little obvious strategic value, few resources and few people — it’s difficult to even breathe up there, with much of the terrain above 15,000 feet. But India and China, both in the grip of increasingly nationalistic governments, will not give an inch of territory, even along a border so remote that it has never been conclusively mapped.The Ladakhis caught in between are a fragile group, numbering perhaps a few hundred thousand. They are Tibetan in culture, identify themselves as Indian and have long been pulled in different directions at the edges of empire.“If we don’t speak now, it will be too late,” said Rigzin Spalbar, a Ladakhi politician. “The Chinese have intruded and encroached on our land. Even the media is not telling the truth. They are only showing the things that the government wants to them to show.” Mr. Spalbar and other prominent Ladakhis insist that they have reported Chinese incursions for years, but that the Indian military refused to do anything about it. They say there was a code of silence, in which the Indian media was complicit, and that the Indian armed forces didn’t want to face the fact that a more powerful and aggressive military was steadily nibbling away at its territory. Indian Army officials declined to comment for this article. Chinese officials have been stingy with details as well, including about whether any Chinese troops were killed in the clash in June. Western intelligence agents, who see the border as one of Asia’s most dangerous flash points, say they think that China lost more than a dozen soldiers in the fight. In early July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India swooped into Ladakh, rallying the troops while wearing a puffy green army jacket and aviator-style shades. “Friends,” he vowed, “the era of expansionism is over,” implying that India was willing to push back against China. Years ago, the two countries agreed that their troops should not shoot at each other during border standoffs. But the Chinese seem to be testing the limits. In the June fighting, which left 20 Indians and an unknown number of Chinese dead, Indian commanders say that Chinese troops used iron clubs bristling with spikes. Many analysts say that China’s actions in Ladakh mirror the more assertive approach China has taken across Asia, especially in the South China Sea, since its leader, Xi Jinping, took over in 2012. And Mr. Modi’s brand of renewed Indian nationalism may also have provoked the Chinese. The Indians, too, have also been building military roads along the disputed border, known as the Line of Actual Control. And Indian officials recently promised to take back Aksai Chin, a high-altitude plateau that India says is part of Ladakh but that China controls and claims as its own. Aksai Chin is “a very important strategic place” to the Chinese military, said Yue Gang, a retired colonel in the People’s Liberation Army. If India were to seize it, he said, it “would cut the transportation between Tibet and Xinjiang,” two restive areas that China is constantly concerned about.  In culture, language, history and Buddhism, Ladakh is close to Tibet. But Ladakhi scholars are firm about one thing: They don’t want to be part of China. “Ladakhis see themselves as Indians,” said Sonam Joldan, a Ladakhi political scientist. Up until a few years ago, Ladakhi and Tibetan nomads roamed freely, pushing their herds of goats, sheep and yak across the lonely, high-altitude plains. They used to converge along a stretch of the Line of Actual Control and barter. The Ladakhis carried Indian products like basmati rice; the Tibetans brought Chinese-made goods like plastic Thermoses. The trading sessions ended, Ladakhis say, after Chinese troops occupied the area. This is hardly the first time Ladakh has been swept up into geopolitics. In the mid-19th century, the British helped set up the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which seems to stretch endlessly across the Himalayas. The British, who controlled the Indian subcontinent, believed that the bigger the buffer zone against the Russian empire, the better. So they allowed the maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir to also grab neighboring Ladakh, enabling him to corner the lucrative trade in pashmina wool. This part of Asia is known for its cashmere (the word for which is derived from Kashmir), and Ladakh’s longhaired Changthangi goats produce especially fine pashmina. But even after several treaties were signed, the border between Ladakh and China was never neatly defined. It snakes across high mountains that few people have ever climbed. “There were different narratives during the British times,” said Siddiq Wahid, a scholar of Central Asian history. “Aksai Chin was a part of Tibet, and it was not a part of Tibet, it was part of Ladakh and not part of Ladakh.” Shortly after India gained independence in 1947 and Pakistan was created, war erupted between the two countries over Jammu and Kashmir. The princely state, which had hoped to stay independent, hurriedly agreed to be part of India, and thus Ladakh became Indian. In 1950, China invaded Tibet and soon built a road linking it to Xinjiang, slicing through Aksai Chin. The area was so desolate that it wasn’t until several years later that India even found out about the road. This triggered a brief war in 1962 that ended in a disastrous loss for India, and China seized all of Aksai Chin, more than 14,000 square miles. By the mid-1970s, things had cooled down, at least on the China front. A protocol evolved between Indian and Chinese troops, including a ban on firearms during border standoffs and regular meetings to iron out disputes. Things were still hot with Pakistan, though. The same piece of territory, Jammu and Kashmir, has propelled India into repeated conflicts with both Pakistan and China — two nations which, like India, have nuclear arms today. Indian soldiers who served along the China border in the 1980s and 1990s remember friendly interactions with the Chinese troops. “We used to shake hands and they would take photos with us and we would take photos with them,” said Sonam Murup, a retired officer. Those visits with the Chinese were welcome distractions. Soldiers stationed along the border had to tramp around a frozen moonscape for weeks, with little food or water. “We’d wash our face once maybe every 15 or 16 days,” Mr. Murup recalled. But the bonhomie with the Chinese ended years ago. Ladakhis say Chinese troops have blocked herders’ access to Indian territory in areas like Demchok and Pangong Tso, a scenic lake where several brawls have erupted. Indian officers say they have tried to follow protocols for avoiding confrontation, like unfurling banners that read “This Is Indian Territory” in English and Chinese, but that the Chinese refuse to listen. Indian commanders acknowledge that their soldiers, too, now carry hand weapons, like bamboo sticks and sling shots. The Chinese have clearly outpaced India in developing the region, Indian commanders concede, which could give them a strategic advantage in a conflict. “They have better facilities,” said Mr. Yadav, the former border official. He said China had paved a highway running right along the border and that Chinese border troops were resupplied by military vehicles carrying supplemental oxygen. But Mr. Yadav said the Indians had some advantages. He claimed the Chinese troops were in poorer shape, saying, “They don’t walk much.” More important, he added: “They have not seen war, while on our side our soldiers have been waging war every day in Kashmir.” Hari Kumar and Sameer Yasir contributed reporting from New Delhi, Iqbal Kirmani from Leh, India, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul, South Korea.']","Ladakh is a place of high-altitude pastures, lonely herders and desolate moonscapes — and a byword for intractable geopolitical disputes."
Coronavirus Outbreak at U.S. Bases in Japan Roils an Uneasy Relationship,2020-07-13,"By Motoko Rich, Makiko Inoue and Hikari Hida","['TOKYO — An outbreak of coronavirus cases on United States military bases in Okinawa, Japan, has alarmed the island’s local population, which at times has been at odds with the Americans stationed there and has otherwise been successful in limiting Covid-19. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has about 20,000 troops stationed on the island, reported 94 confirmed cases to the prefectural government and said it had instituted strict measures in all 33 installations in the region.  Denny Tamaki, the governor of Okinawa, said he was shocked by the number of infections and said it was “extremely regrettable” that so many cases had emerged among American troops and affiliated personnel in less than a week. Excluding the American cases, Okinawa has recorded just 148 infections since February. Mr. Tamaki added that he had “strong doubts” about the prevention measures reported by the United States. Japan, which has been relatively successful in containing the virus, has also experienced a recent surge of new cases concentrated in Tokyo, where a state of emergency was lifted at the end of May. Tokyo reported two consecutive days of record daily infections last week, with a large number of cases among people in their 20s and 30s who worked in or had visited venues in Tokyo’s nightlife districts. The United States military in South Korea also announced on Monday that 11 troops had tested positive upon arrival from the United States. The American military has struggled with outbreaks among its troops, with a major cluster of infections in March on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. The Japanese military, by contrast, has reported just 14 cases among its defense forces, all of whom are thought to have contracted the virus in their communities rather than while deployed.  The cases in Okinawa are a new strain on relations between the military and the local government, where the presence of American bases, dating to the end of World War II, has been an ongoing source of friction. Citizens have long complained of noise, crime and aircraft accidents, and have repeatedly questioned why nearly half of the 55,000 American troops in Japan — which include personnel from all of the military branches — are stationed on Okinawa. One of the bases where a number of the recent coronavirus cases have been recorded, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, is the subject of a contentious plan to relocate the base’s operations from central Okinawa to a less-populated coastal area where construction is underway. The Japanese central government considers the bases essential to the country’s security, and many citizens and businesses on Okinawa welcome the troops as customers and neighbors. When news of infections first started emerging from the bases, both the governor and the Okinawa prefectural assembly demanded more information from the Marine Corps about the number of cases, which troubled Okinawan officials and residents who feared they may have unknowingly come into contact with infected troops. “When anything like this happens, when the military doesn’t provide essential information of how many people are infected or where they are from or where they have been outside of the base, the Okinawan people are really scared and frustrated and disappointed,” said Manabu Sato, professor of political science at Okinawa International University, which overlooks the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. “I’m scared,” said Tomonari Kiyuna, a worker at a noodle shop in Chatan, a neighborhood on Okinawa frequented by American soldiers. “We’re very careful, wearing masks, washing hands, and sanitizing,” Mr. Kiyuna said. “I want them to disclose the information. They are Americans but they are staying in Okinawa, Japan. Okinawans or the Japanese people have the right to know” about infections stemming from the bases. Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said in a news conference that the government had “received the necessary information from the U.S.’s side, such as numbers of infected personnel and facilities affected.” Governor Tamaki said he was concerned that the soldiers had spread infections during celebrations on July 4. “There is information that the U.S. Forces personnel went out to the nightlife districts and had beach parties outside of the bases on July 4,” Mr. Tamaki said in a statement on Saturday. He requested that the military stop transferring new troops from the United States, where case numbers are surging. Under measures instituted over the weekend, all American troops and families on Okinawa are prohibited from leaving base without approval from commanders. They cannot visit restaurants, even for takeout, travel on public transit, use child-care facilities or exercise off base. Futenma and Camp Hansen, where the largest number of cases have been reported, are effectively on lockdown, American officials said. Throughout Japan, all troops and families arriving from the United States must quarantine for 14 days, said Col. Robert A. Firman, public affairs director for U.S. Forces Japan. “That measure will continue for the foreseeable future,” Colonel Firman said. “Installation commanders also have the discretion to increase protective measures based on local conditions, and that’s what we are seeing in Okinawa.” Colonel Firman said that military staff must also wear masks in most base facilities, implement social distancing and limit the size of any gatherings. Major Kenneth Kunze, a spokesman for the Marines on Okinawa, said that “thorough contact tracing is ongoing to identify and isolate those who may have come in contact with infected personnel. Anyone on or off base identified as having been in contact with an infected or suspected infected individual will be notified.” One of the largest hospitals on Okinawa, Chubu Hospital, has offered free testing to anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to the virus. So far, the hospital has tested 130 people since news of the base outbreaks. In a Facebook post, Yoshihiro Takayama, a doctor in the Infectious Disease and Public health department at Chubu Hospital, warned against blaming the military for the spread of the virus. “People tend to misunderstand that the U.S. service personnel spread the virus as many cases were found among them,” Dr. Takayama wrote. “But I don’t think so. It’s assumed that they were infected on July 4, judging from the confirmed date. But it’s still unknown from whom they got infected as epidemiological information is not shared. They could have been infected from contact with Japanese residents or among service personnel. It is supposed that there are multiple routes, but we should not have preconceptions.” He added that people had “visited many bars, danced in groups shoulder to shoulder and shared wine bottles,” including both American military personnel and local residents. In Chatan, where there are many bars frequented by the Americans, businesses noticed a downturn as the base lockdowns went into effect. “We saw a huge drop in customers yesterday, especially Americans,” said Itaru Maeshiro, owner of the Transit Cafe, where about a third of regular customers are American military personnel. At a sushi shop in Chatan, chef Kazuya Kaneshi said that the strict lockdown measures were tough for business. “But we don’t want infections at the same time,” he said. “If infections expand in the whole of Okinawa, it will be a huge problem.” Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']","The Marines reported 94 new cases on Okinawa, an island that had seen just 148 other infections.

"In Latin America, the Pandemic Threatens Equality Like Never Before",2020-07-11,"By Julie Turkewitz, Sofía Villamil and Federico Rios","['Over the past two decades, inequality in Latin America had fallen to the lowest point in its recorded history. The pandemic threatens to reverse that. We traveled 1,000 miles across Colombia to document this critical moment. BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Sandra Abello grew up poor, left school at 11 and spent her teenage years scrubbing floors as a live-in maid. But by this year, something remarkable had happened. Ms. Abello, now 39, finally had a home in a decent neighborhood. One of her daughters, Karol, was about to finish high school. Another, Nicol, was turning 15, and they were planning a party with a big dress and many guests. They were saving for a washing machine. Ms. Abello was proud of all she had accomplished. Then the pandemic hit, and Ms. Abello lost her cleaning work. By May, she had been evicted, forcing her to move her children into a tin shed in an illegal settlement high above the city. At night, a bitter cold pushed its way in. A lifetime of effort had evaporated in a matter of weeks. Ms. Abello’s oldest daughter, Karol, an aspiring nurse, called it the “great regression.” Not long ago, Colombia — and Latin America more broadly — were in the middle of a history-making transformation: The scourge of inequality was shrinking like never before. Over the past 20 years, millions of families had marched out of poverty in one of the most unequal regions on earth. The gap between rich and poor in Latin America fell to its lowest point on record. Now, the pandemic is threatening to reverse those gains like nothing else in recent history, economists say, potentially upending politics and entire societies for years to come. We — two reporters and a photographer with The New York Times — wanted to understand what this meant for the region’s future, and in particular for the families that had been so central to that march toward economic equality. So we began to drive, packing the car with masks and traveling more than 1,000 miles from Colombia’s capital to the northeastern border and back, interviewing dozens of people about the way the pandemic was changing the course of their lives. As we went, leaving the mountain-flanked high-rises of Bogotá for the tropical regions beyond, it became clear that the engines of upward mobility were failing, choked off by an economic shutdown that began in March and fell hardest on the working poor and vulnerable members of the middle class. Small businesses had closed for good. Universities were hemorrhaging students. Schools that had turned the children of construction workers into engineers were near collapse, unable to pay teachers. Farmers were burning their crops, ruined by disrupted markets. Teenage boys had turned to selling drugs to feed their siblings. Young women and girls had been pushed into prostitution to pay the bills. Mothers and fathers began rationing medicine to their children, unsure when they would have money for more. Wealthy people retreated to countryside homes, while other families sold their cellphones to buy dinner. “It was never my dream to go backward,” said David Aguirre, 32, who had risen from a low-level bodyguard to the boss of his own strawberry farm. He had poured his life savings into his business, opening just a few months before the pandemic struck. Now it was unclear if the farm would survive. When we met, he’d just fired his four workers and killed off a quarter of his crop — unable to find a buyer and unable to pay his employees to pick it. The berries lay dry and cracked around us, poisoned with Roundup, and he worried about returning to the dangerous work of protecting the wealthy. “The sacrifice of many people, days of work from 6 to 6 at night, rain, sun,” he said. “And then — for it all to become nothing?” Bogotá Even on the first day of our journey, we could see the distance between the rich and poor widening. We drove into the hills above the capital, to an encampment of hastily built sheds that had long been a last resort for desperate families. When the lockdown began, the settlement quickly swelled with people like Ms. Abello who had been moving up — bakery employees, preschool janitors — but lost their jobs and apartments. The pandemic hadn’t just stalled their progress. It suddenly made them squatters. That day, the police arrived with a wrecking crew, saying that the settlement was illegal and too precariously built to live in, even if tearing it down exacerbated the pain of the pandemic. Ms. Abello’s walls fell with a terrifying clatter. For the second time in the brief life of the crisis, she and her family had nowhere to go. Medellín Eight hours outside of Bogotá, the school appeared like a sanctuary on a hill, ringed by an expansive lawn and a gate. The institution, Mi Segundo Hogar, had played a life-changing role for families of modest means over the years, offering low-cost, high-quality education. It produced flight attendants and pharmacists in families where the parents had walked barefoot to class. Now, the school sat empty, with in-person classes canceled across Latin America. Unemployed parents had stopped paying fees, sometimes apologizing profusely through text message, and the school was barely paying instructors. On the patio, the rector, Lina Castrillón, said Mi Segundo Hogar was in danger of closing. Technically, classes had moved online, but only a fraction of the students were able to connect every day. Many didn’t have computers, or tried to log on via cellphone, and data was expensive. It was not just that her students were going to slide backward in their learning, Ms. Castrillón said. She worried this interruption would fundamentally reshape their lives, leading to dropouts and lower pay, stunting an entire generation. At home, disconnected from school, she said, “they are losing their vision” of a better future. For years, Colombia was a glaring example of the region’s wealth gap — and of the struggles to narrow it. The nation’s generations-long war with rebels grew out of anger over inequality. Class divisions are so baked into society that poorer people refer to wealthier ones as “your mercy” in casual conversation, a relic of colonialism. Cities are divided into “estratos,” which signify one’s social class. The rich live in estrato six. The poor live in estrato one. Those in informal settlements — which legally don’t exist — live in what people colloquially call “estrato zero.” But life had been changing, considerably. Colombia, one of the most unequal countries in an extremely inequitable region, cut its poverty rate nearly in half, to 27 percent, from 2002 to 2018. The country signed a historic peace deal with the main rebel group, promising to help thousands on the economic and social margins join the nation’s success. The gulf between rich and poor was still stubbornly wide compared with much of the world. In the 1990s, the wealthiest 10 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean earned about 50 times more than the poorest 10 percent, according to Matías Busso, an economist with the Inter-American Development Bank. By the time the pandemic hit, top earners made an average 22 times what the poorest made. So while inequality clung to the region, it had fallen to a record low, he said. Now, the pandemic could push poverty and inequality back to what they were at the turn of the 21st century in Colombia, according to an analysis by professors at the Universidad de los Andes. “A setback of two decades,” they called it. Economists are predicting similar regressions around the region, with the World Bank warning that more than 50 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean could fall into poverty this year alone. “The current crisis is probably the biggest threat to inequality that we have experienced,” Mr. Busso said. In Medellín, we watched hundreds of single mothers line up outside a food bank that expanded significantly when the crisis began. One woman, María Camila Salazar, 22, said her mother, María Eugenia Carvalho, 53, had become so dangerously malnourished that her thin shoulders now jutted from her frame. “We go to bed without eating, without giving anything to our children,” she said. Before the pandemic, Carolina Urda, 31, who runs the food bank, had been working to expand a sewing and washing business meant to move women in unstable jobs — nannies, recycling collectors — into something more secure. The women now had no jobs at all, and Ms. Urda was spending hours each week gathering food to feed their families. “But we don’t want more food,” she said, shaking two fists in frustration. “We want empowered, self-sufficient, autonomous businesswomen.” Bucaramanga Perhaps the most glaring image of Latin America’s backslide was the highway. We had expected to find empty routes. Instead, mile after mile, we met processions of Venezuelan migrants pulling suitcases toward home. They had come to Colombia only a few years or even months before, part of an exodus of migrants escaping Venezuela’s political and economic collapse. Many had hoped to learn a trade or finish a degree in Colombia, or just make enough money to help their families back home. Now, because of the pandemic, the people we met had lost whatever small hold they had on a life in Colombia — a job, an apartment — and were migrating in reverse, returning to a nation where they were almost certain that disaster awaited. Most said they had family in Venezuela who could help them, while in Colombia they no longer had anything. “Hope is over,” said one man, Rafael Decena, 50. Since the pandemic began, more than 80,000 Venezuelans have crossed back into their country, according to Colombian authorities. In Bucaramanga, a midsize city in Colombia, hundreds of migrant families camped outside a park to rest. One night, a parade of buses arrived, a fleet sent by the Colombian government to take people the last 120 miles to the border. Roraima Daversa, 26, and her son Amado, 9, climbed aboard, their feet cracked and blistered. They had spent night after night sleeping on the side of the road. As Ms. Daversa took a seat, tears began rolling down her face. She felt relief. She and Amado no longer had to walk. “Every day he asked, ‘How much longer?’” But there was also grief. Ms. Daversa, who had studied environmental management in Venezuela, had hoped to save money in Bogotá and return to her country to open a business. Now, she was headed back, worse off than when she left. Cúcuta In Cúcuta, a town pressed up against the Venezuelan border, a 17-year-old stood in a cranberry-colored T-shirt and jean shorts, tugging at a purse with a shiny bow, swinging one heel nervously. A few men approached. A ribbon of cars roared past. When the lockdown began, her father lost his job in construction and the refrigerator emptied. Pushed to desperation, she made the excruciating decision to head to a local park, where men began to pay her for sex, $6 an encounter. She was not even the youngest one there to do so. Somebody had to bring in money, she said, “and it turned to me.” Before the crisis, she had been selling small items — cigarettes, candy — in the street. But she had always dreamed of returning to school, of becoming a criminologist like those powerful women on television. Having sex with strangers is “horrible,” she said, and when she has to, she imagines herself in a classroom, with her friends, to distract herself. Over the past two decades, school attendance and rising access to birth control played a crucial role in shrinking the country’s wealth gap, allowing millions of women to study and work, when so many of their mothers had been forced to stay home. When the pandemic hit, though, the number of women forced into prostitution swelled in Cúcuta, said Alejandra Vera, the director of a local advocacy group. So did the number of unwanted pregnancies, as travel restrictions and job losses made it difficult to get condoms and other types of birth control. One morning, the 17-year-old, whose name is being withheld because she is a minor, woke before dawn to the pleas of her son, six months old, who wanted to toddle along the floor and play. She made coffee and dropped off her son with his father at a house down the road. Her mother, 54, saw her off from their patio. She knew what her daughter was doing. It is hard for her to talk about. “I don’t criticize or condemn,” the mother said. “There’s no work now,” she added, breaking down. “This is not a life.” Bogotá Back in Bogotá, Ms. Abello, the mother who had been evicted twice amid the pandemic, had moved in with a friend, both families crammed together. Karol, the aspiring nurse, was trying her best to keep up with classes, but she couldn’t log into the school website without the internet, so a friend was downloading the assignments and texting them to her. She then completed them by hand, took pictures and texted them back. But it was hard, and she worried she was falling behind. Nicol, the younger daughter, turned 15. They had a small celebration, just family, and she wore Karol’s old dress, black, with tulle. As the quarantine loosened, Ms. Abello finally returned to her job cleaning a bakery. But her housekeeping clients never asked her back, and she was earning about half as much as she did before. It wasn’t clear when they’d be able to move into their own place. “This has been hard on my mom,” said Karol. “As soon as this is over, I hope she gets new work and we can go back to our old lives.” “Well,” she said, “God willing.” Jenny Carolina González contributed reporting from Bogotá.']",
"Brexit Border Bureaucracy Looms for Truckers, Pet Owners and Travelers",2020-07-13,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — No more seamless access to medical care. A spike in cellphone bills. And months of preparation if you are bringing the dog. For Britons who have lapsed into complacency about crossing the English Channel in the four years since they voted for Brexit, the situation will soon get a lot more complicated. Up until now, the biggest problem they faced was driving on the wrong side of the road when reaching France. With Brexit grinding into its final phase, a government publicity drive is warning that Britons will lose health care rights in European Union countries and could pay roaming fees when using cellphones there. Perhaps as alarming for a nation of dog lovers, roaming freely will be harder for British pets. Owners must plan four months in advance to secure the paperwork to take them. Britain formally left the European Union in January but is honoring most of the bloc’s rules until a transition period ends in December. After that Britain will be outside the bloc’s economic structures and can proceed with plans to tighten immigration controls and strike trade agreements around the globe. But for travelers, and many businesses, the end of the transition period means more of one thing often regarded as a specialty of the European Union: bureaucracy. “For ordinary travelers it means getting ready for paying more and for more inconvenience,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London. “For business, the government is telling them to get ready for an enormous amount more paperwork.” Talks between Britain and the European Union over a trade deal are scheduled to continue on Wednesday. Despite new optimism around them, there is no sign of an immediate breakthrough. Even assuming Prime Minister Boris Johnson strikes an agreement with the bloc that guarantees no tariffs or quotas on trade, more controls on imports and exports are inevitable. That is the outcome of leaving the bloc’s single market and customs union — something Mr. Johnson has promised to do — a system that allows thousands of trucks to roll off ferries between Dover and Calais each day, mostly without stopping. According to British government estimates, the change of rules will require an additional 400 million customs declarations each year, adding a significant cost to businesses. The government has said it will spend more than 700 million British pounds — about $880 million — on infrastructure plans and will build around a dozen facilities near ports to process imports. If the technology works as planned, while trucks are crossing the Channel, their drivers will be instructed by text message whether they are required to stop at a special site either at a port or nearby. Others will be allowed to complete formalities at their destinations. “We are committed to working closely with businesses and the border industry to help deliver not just a fully operational border at the end of the transition period, but also the world’s most effective and secure border,” said Michael Gove, a senior Cabinet member with the title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. But he acknowledged that a new customs system will not be fully functioning until next July, so Britain will effectively wave many European trucks through ports for several months. That has provoked fears of a legal challenge under the rules of the World Trade Organization, according to a leaked internal letter from Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, with concerns that, under some circumstances, Britain could be deemed to be giving preferential treatment to E.U. imports by not subjecting them to the same conditions as, for example, American or Australian ones. The customs change poses big economic risks. One business lobbying organization, the Institute of Directors, surveyed 978 members and found less than a quarter were fully prepared. One in seven said they were distracted by the coronavirus crisis and almost one-third wanted the details of the new system to be clear before adjusting. “With so much going on, many directors feel that preparing for Brexit proper is like trying to hit a moving target. Jumping immediately into whatever comes next would be a nightmare for many businesses,” said Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors. Part of the problem is that Britain has been here before, having missed successive deadlines last year for its departure from the European Union. In 2019, some businesses prepared for a rupture only to find it unnecessary. So this time, the government needs to ensure that companies know change is coming, even before it is clear how much the disruption can be minimized. Travelers too need to know that the rights many have taken for granted, like working or retiring in continental Europe, are at an end. So the government campaign, with a slogan “The U.K.’s new start: let’s get going” is warning Britons, for example, that they will no longer be able to use a European pet passport system and will need different paperwork. Mr. Johnson, who was elected with the help of many voters in northern, working-class districts, is unlikely to fret about upsetting affluent, pro-European Britons who commute with their pets to vacation homes in rural France. On Monday the government also announced details of a new immigration system to be introduced next year, once Britain ends the free movement of European Union workers. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said the system would “attract the best and brightest from around the world,” but many low-paid workers will be excluded, which has alarmed several types of employers that rely on them, including nursing-care institutions. But the government hopes that such employers will have to increase wages to attract Britons to perform those jobs. That upward pressure on earnings could prove popular in economically disadvantaged parts of the country, which Mr. Johnson has promised to help by “leveling up” prosperity. So far, the prime minister has paid no political penalty for taking a hard line over Brexit, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, has not called for an extension of the transition period. If the disruption to trade and travel is severe, however, criticism is certain to grow. And the government has struggled to provide much evidence of the opportunities it promised would flow from leaving the European Union. “The change of tone was clear last year in the Conservative election campaign slogan,” said Mr. Menon. “Let’s ‘get Brexit done’ implied that this is something to get out of the way.”']",Next year businesses and travelers face mounds of new paperwork (and higher cellphone bills) as Britain builds up frontier controls.
‘I Felt Defenseless’: Seoul Mayor’s Secretary Speaks Out About Alleged Abuse,2020-07-13,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The secretary to one of the most powerful political figures in South Korea, Mayor Park Won-soon of Seoul, described suffering years of abuse and sexual harassment at his hands, calling in her first public statement on Monday for a world where women can be treated “like humans.” The statement was released hours after the funeral of Mr. Park, who committed suicide last week after his secretary went to the police with her accusations. “I felt defenseless and weak before the immense power,” the woman said in a statement released through her lawyer at a news conference on Monday. “I wanted to shout at him in a safe court of law, telling him to stop it. I wanted to cry out how much he has hurt me.” “I wanted to forgive him,” the statement continued. “I wanted him to be judged in a court of law and to apologize to me as a fellow human.” While his mindset is unknown, Mr. Park, a lifelong champion of women and the second most powerful official in Seoul after the president, killed himself on Thursday, a day after his secretary, whose name and other personal information were not released, went to the police with her allegations. In his suicide note, Mr. Park did not mention the accusations, saying only that he was “sorry to everyone.” On Monday, the woman’s lawyer, as well as activists, called for an investigation, saying she had been widely vilified on social media, where online trolls tried to reveal her identity and blamed her for driving the popular mayor to kill himself. Under the legal procedures of South Korea, Mr. Park’s criminal case is closed, and there will be no indictment, because the suspect is dead. “What has happened doesn’t go away just because the accused is dead,” said Go Mi-kyeong, head of the Korea Women’s Hotline, one of the women’s rights groups where Mr. Park’s secretary sought help after going to the police. “The first step toward restoring the victim’s human rights is to unveil the full truth.” Ms. Go called on the police to disclose what they have learned so far about the case. The police interviewed the victim and her lawyer for almost 10 hours until early Thursday. Ms. Go also demanded that Seoul City Hall launch an investigation on why it had dismissed the secretary’s earlier complaints of sexual harassment. “When she appealed for help with City Hall, officials there just tried to protect the mayor, saying that he would never have done such a thing or that she should dismiss it like a minor mistake,” said Lee Mi-kyeong, head of the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center, another women’s right group. “This is a typical case of sexual violence where the victim faces a tremendous power and is blocked from raising an issue.” Seoul City Hall did not immediately respond to the demand for an investigation. In South Korea, men dominate society’s upper echelons, enforcing a strictly hierarchical code. The culture can make women vulnerable to\u200b sexual\u200b abuse and make it difficult to speak out. As in other countries, the #MeToo movement has rippled across South Korea in recent years. Women have come forward with accusations of sexual abuse against an array of prominent men, including theater directors, politicians, professors, religious leaders and a former coach for the national speedskating team. Many of the accused have apologized and resigned from their positions. Several have faced criminal charges. Mr. Park was by far the most prominent South Korean facing #MeToo accusations. In 2018, he won a record third-term as mayor of Seoul, a city of 10 million where he pushed policies to make it safer for women. As a well-known human rights lawyer, he won the country’s first sexual harassment case. Kim Jae-ryeon, the\u200b secretary’s lawyer, said the \u200bvictim first came to her on May 12, accusing Mr. Park of sexually harassing her in his office and \u200bin a\u200b bedroom attached to it. Mr. Park pressed his body on \u200bher while taking selfies\u200b, the lawyer said during the news conference\u200b. He \u200balso \u200bcalled her into his bedroom and asked her to hug him. Usually late at night, he sent obscene messages and photos of him in underwear through \u200bTelegram, an encrypted messaging app, the lawyer said. “Once, when he saw a bruise on the victim’s knee, he touched his lips \u200bthere, saying that it will heal the wound,” the lawyer said. The lawyer said the victim had told the police that she showed some of Mr. Park’s obscene messages to her friends, as well as a journalist and fellow \u200bCity Hall workers. The secretary also presented the police with incriminating evidence from her smartphone, she said. Mr. Park, now dead, cannot defend himself over these accusations. His family has urged the news media not to carry unconfirmed, one-sided accusations. Amid rain on Monday, hundreds of supporters gathered in front of City Hall, as Mr. Park’s funeral was held inside. \u200bWhen the hearse carried Mr. Park’s body out to be cremated, many supporters wailed \u200band some tried to block the\u200b vehicle. His ashes were later moved to Changnyeong\u200b, his hometown\u200b in southern South Korea, which he left 50 years \u200bago \u200bto pursue one of the most storied political careers in South Korea. Mr. Park’s death divided South Korean society. Many lamented online the premature departure of one of the country’s most talented human rights lawyers, who laid the foundation for the country’s now vibrant civil-society movement. But his detractors called him a “hypocrite.” As political, religious and other leaders\u200b have\u200b paid tribute to him\u200b in the past few days\u200b, some lawmakers and women’s rights leaders have refused to follow suit. In her statement on Monday, \u200bhis secretary expressed condolences over Mr. Park’s death. But she said she felt “stifled” by the way society gave him such a rousing funeral, while she has been subjected to “distortions and speculations” over her motive. “I ask myself how I am going to continue to live,” she said.

Seoul Will Investigate #MeToo Accusations Against Dead Mayor,2020-07-15,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Seoul City Hall officials said on Wednesday that they would create a joint fact-finding team with women’s groups and legal and human rights experts to investigate accusations that Mayor Park Won-soon had sexually abused a secretary for four years. The team’s members \u200bwill \u200bhave no power to subpoena or indict those they want to \u200bquestion because Mr. Park, 64, killed himself on Thursday, a day after the secretary filed a complaint against him to the police. By law, the criminal case against Mr. Park was automatically closed upon his death. But women’s rights activists, as well as the unidentified secretary, who spoke to the news media through her lawyer, have called for an investigation even if prosecutors cannot bring charges against Mr. Park. In a survey conducted \u200bby Realmeter a \u200bday after Mr. Park’s funeral on Monday, more than 64 percent of respondents said they considered an investigation necessary, the company said on Wednesday. “The most important thing is to find the truth,” said Hwang In-sik, a spokesman for the city of Seoul, during a news conference on Wednesday, where he announced the fact-finding investigation. But Mr. Hwang indicated that the investigators might be able to ask City Hall for disciplinary actions or even \u200brequest that \u200bthe police begin a formal investigation if they find enough incriminating evidence against any \u200bCity Hall \u200bofficials other than Mr. Park. Besides the secretary’s allegations\u200b of sexual harassment\u200b, the investigators will look into when and through whom Mr. Park first learned of his secretary’s complaint to the police. Women’s rights activists have said that the filing was leaked to Mr. Park, giving him an opportunity to potentially destroy evidence before he died by suicide. They also said that the secretary’s initial appeals to city officials for help had been ignored as officials tried to protect Mr. Park’s reputation. \u200b “I am so crushed that I can hardly find a word to say to the people,” Lee Hae-chan, the head of the Democratic Party, said on Wednesday about the accusations against the late mayor. “I once again say we are sorry to the people.” The suicide of Mr. Park, as well as the accusations against him, have dominated news headlines in South Korea for several days. As mayor of Seoul, a city of 10 million, Mr. Park was South Korea’s second-most-powerful elected official, credited with making the city safer and more friendly toward women and often \u200bcited as a possible presidential candidate\u200b. \u200b Before becoming mayor, \u200bMr. Park had been one of the country’s most prominent human rights lawyer\u200bs\u200b, \u200bchampioning women’s rights throughout his career\u200b and winning the country’s first sexual harassment case. The accusations against Mr. Park were also a blow to \u200bPresident Moon Jae-in’s governing liberal Democratic Party\u200b, of which Mr. Park had been a member. Two other party members have\u200b recently\u200b become the focus of the #MeToo movement. In April, Oh Keo-don, the mayor of Busan, South Korea’s second-largest city, admitted to sexual misconduct and resigned after a public servant accused him of sexually assaulting her in his office. In 2018, Ahn Hee-jung, a rising star in Mr. Moon’s party and a presidential hopeful, stepped down as governor of South Chungcheong Province after his secretary went on television to accuse him of repeatedly sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on rape charges.']","A fact-finding team will have no power to subpoena or indict anyone, but women’s rights activists and the mayor’s accuser have called for an investigation anyway."
Poland’s Presidential Election Was Close but Voters Remain Far Apart,2020-07-14,By Marc Santora,"['WARSAW — President Andrzej Duda narrowly won re-election this week, using the same playbook that brought his Law and Justice party to power five years ago: stoking fear and blaming an enemy. In 2015, it was an enemy at the gates: Migrants, who party leaders said carried “all sorts of parasites,” were threatening the nation. This time, it was an enemy within: Gay men and lesbians living in Poland, Mr. Duda said, were promoting an ideology “more dangerous than communism.” Mr. Duda won by a thin margin in the closest election in the country since the end of communist rule in 1989. But the bitter campaign against his opponent, Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, exposed old rifts and created new divisions in Poland that are unlikely to go away any time soon. “This election was focused on inner conflicts and inner division,” said Andrzej Leder, a sociology professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences. “And the level of polarization was stunning.” The optimism that greeted Mr. Trzaskowski’s campaign has been replaced by despair among his supporters, and those who feel they were targeted by Mr. Duda’s homophobic language fear what may be ahead. “I am terrified by Duda’s words,” said Kamil Tkaczyk, a 27-year-old hairdresser in Warsaw, who is gay. “Together with my partner we are considering migrating to a country, which would not only be free of prejudice, but most of all, where we could feel safe,” he said. Mr. Tkaczyk and others who oppose the government say the recent election was not only about trying to safeguard democracy in Poland, where the Law and Justice Party has overhauled the country’s courts in a way that critics say undermines the rule of law. It was also about defending the country’s place in Europe and the world. While supporters of the government point to the generous social welfare programs that have helped bridge economic inequality in Poland, many who voted for Mr. Trzaskowski blame Mr. Duda’s campaign for solidifying the political polarization that has taken hold across the country. “Politics is becoming really brutal again,” said Mr. Leder, the professor. “While the ruling party won politically, they have not won culturally,” he added. “The government knows these are the last years they can really try and change the mentality of the country.”  Party leaders have already signaled they plan to move forward with proposals that would silence critics, apply pressure on academic institutions and exert even more control of the courts. In April, the Court of Justice of the European Union ordered the suspension of a new disciplinary chamber of the Polish Supreme Court, which has a politically selected membership and extraordinary powers to prosecute judges who oppose the government. Some of the most influential and nonpartisan media outlets in the country are owned by foreign companies, such as Ringier Axel Springer, a German publisher. During the campaign, Mr. Duda warned of a “German attack” in the election and criticized the Warsaw correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party leader, said on Tuesday that “media in Poland should be Polish.” Mr. Kaczynski also told the Polish Press Agency that the government planned to “take actions” to ensure media outlets covered the news “more realistically.” Mr. Leder, who opposes the Law and Justice party, said that people under the age of 50 sent a clear message to the ruling party by thoroughly rejecting Mr. Duda and his campaign. Younger, urban voters overwhelmingly supported Mr. Trzaskowski, whose campaign nearly dislodged an incumbent president with a host of advantages, including the use of state media and the help of prominent supporters within the Catholic clergy as well as President Trump. Mr. Trzaskowski won Warsaw with 68 percent of the vote. He also won voters aged 40 to 59 by 10 points, those 30 to 39 by 11 points, and those 18 to 29 by nearly 30 points. Mr. Duda handily beat the Warsaw mayor with voters over 50 by nearly 20 points and those over 60 by 25 points. Mr. Duda supporters were also mostly in eastern and southern regions of the country, where the economy is still lagging. Cezary Tomczyk, the head of Mr. Trzaskowski’s campaign team, said they planned to file a formal protest with the Supreme Court disputing the election results. But few expect the challenge to lead to any action or change the outcome, given the party’s control over the courts. Jan Grabiec, a spokesman for the opposition Civic Coalition party, said they were also reviewing complaints, especially with regard to ballots cast outside the country, which were handled by the government. “What happened abroad is an enormous scandal,” said Mr. Grabiec. “Wherever the election was organized by the National Electoral Commission, it went more or less OK. But wherever it was organized by people subject to the government, it was a disaster,” he said. Marcin Matczak, a constitutional scholar who has opposed the changes to the judiciary made by Law and Justice, said there is now a systemic problem with the courts. “The key function of the courts is to settle social conflicts in a civilized manner,” he said. “After what Law and Justice did to the judiciary, the Supreme Court that is to issue the decision on the validity of the election cannot fulfill this function anymore.” Many in the country will not respect the court’s decision, no matter how it rules. The conflict “over the fairness of the presidential election will go on instead of being settled by the Supreme Court,” said Mr. Matczak. “The bad emotions will escalate, the divisions will grow. This is what happens to a society deprived of an independent judiciary.” Since declaring victory, Mr. Duda has struck a conciliatory tone. “It was a tough campaign, at times probably too tough,” he said on Monday. “If anyone felt offended by my words, I ask them to forgive me. And to give me another five years to improve.” His assurances are unlikely to satisfy Zbigniew Maraszek, a 53-year-old high school teacher from Plonsk, a city of 20,000 in central Poland. Mr. Maraszek said the government had created an atmosphere that had become “unbearable.” His wife, Katarzyna, a 47-year old university teacher, blamed the government for “weaponizing” the Catholic Church in the party’s fight against homosexuality. “I consider myself a Catholic, but I find it unacceptable,” she said. Still, despite her strong support for Mr. Trzaskowski, Ms. Maraszek was not able to convince her mother to change her mind at the polls. Her mother, she said, voted for Mr. Duda. Monika Pronczuk and Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting.']","President Andrzej Duda won a narrow victory after a bitter, polarizing campaign that tore at the social fabric of the country.

The Tahini War: The Food at the Center of an Arab Gay Rights Battle,2020-07-15,By Adam Rasgon,"['TEL AVIV — When Julia Zaher, the owner of a company that makes some of the most popular tahini in Israel, made a donation to an Israeli gay rights group recently, she saw it as an unremarkable act. “When I see people in a tough place, I always like to help them,” Ms. Zaher, 65, an Arab citizen of Israel, said in an interview. “If everyone turns their back on this community, who is going to help?” But after the gay rights organization publicly thanked her, the backlash in Israel’s socially conservative Arab community was swift and unforgiving. Activists called for a boycott of her company, Al Arz. Videos circulated on Facebook and Twitter of Arab shopkeepers pulling Al Arz’s tahini from their shelves and throwing it in the garbage. An executive at one of the largest Arab-owned grocery chains in Israel, Al Mashadawi, said it was considering dropping Al Arz from its 14 stores. “We have values that we follow,” said Jabr Hejazi, a supermarket owner in the northern town of Tamra who abruptly stopped carrying the brand. “It’s a simple matter.” But gay rights activists say the controversy has had the welcome side effect of focusing attention on a group whose problems have been ignored for too long: gay and transgender members of Israel’s Arab minority, who say they are marginalized and discriminated twice over. “This is a huge event,” said Khader Abu-Seif, 33, an L.G.B.T. rights activist in Tel Aviv. “Of course, we’re seeing ugliness, but we’re also seeing support from people who never spoke out openly for us in the past.” Ms. Zaher, a mild-mannered, strong-willed mother of two from Nazareth, may seem an unlikely catalyst for the controversy. A schoolteacher for decades, she took over her husband’s tahini business when he died after a heart attack in 2003. The company was in poor financial shape, she said in an interview on Saturday in Tel Aviv. But she poured herself into it, paying off debts, convincing the bank to lend her more money and upgrading the manufacturing process. Today, her company’s two plants in the Nazareth area produce a whopping 20 to 25 tons of tahini a day. The thick paste they make from Ethiopian sesame seeds is nearly ubiquitous at supermarkets and restaurants in Israel, and is exported to 18 countries including the United States. And Ms. Zaher became the rare woman to lead a major Arab-owned company. No stranger to philanthropy, she had made previous donations to benefit women’s rights and people with disabilities. The donation she made to Aguda, a national L.G.B.T. rights organization, was to help set up a hotline for Arabic-speaking Israelis. The group’s C.E.O., Ohad Hizki, declined to say how much Ms. Zaher had given, but called it “significant.” He said the hotline would be open for calls by next month. The controversy erupted when Aguda thanked Ms. Zaher on Twitter on July 1. Mouad Khateb, one of the most prominent opponents of the donation, expressed the views of many critics, saying that he had no objection to whatever gay and transgender people do in private, but that the donation would contribute to “normalizing” their “unnatural” way of life to the Arab public. “What’s most problematic is when Arabs are participating in these efforts,” said Mr. Khateb, who has used derogatory terms to describe members of the L.G.B.T. community and claimed that they suffered from “psychological disorders” requiring “treatment.” But the boycott has also drawn public opposition from supporters of gay rights. “I’m with Al Arz against the boycott,” wrote Hana Amoury, a resident of the port city of Jaffa, on Facebook. “Those still saying and thinking gay people are ‘abnormal’ need to do some reading.” Mr. Abu-Seif, the activist, noted that an Arab lawmaker from Acre, Aida Touma-Sliman, had spoken out in defense of the L.G.B.T. community — a rare instance, he said, and a sign that it was becoming more difficult for Arab politicians to remain on the sidelines when the L.G.B.T. community was under assault. Aside from the anti-gay backlash, some gay Arabs also criticized the donation for going to an Israeli organization, which they contend supports policies that work to erase the Palestinian experience, instead of a Palestinian one. Aguda denies the accusation, saying it advocates equal rights for all gay and transgender people in Israel, regardless of their religious or national background. Al Arz’s donation was only the latest in a series of public demonstrations of support for Arab gays and lesbians, activists say. In May, thousands of mourners attended the funeral of Ayman Safiah, a gay dancer who drowned in the Mediterranean after helping save the life of a friend. And last August, hundreds of people protested in Haifa after the stabbing of a young transgender Arab. “What we have been seeing is the taboo slowly being broken down,” said Fady Khoury, 35, a gay civil rights lawyer from Haifa. “Everything that happened in the past year is the culmination of the work that has been done over the past two decades — all the efforts activists have made to promote social change on this issue.” But Ms. Zaher, whose phone has been ringing constantly over the past week, said she was still puzzled by the uproar. “I never could have imagined that something like this would happen,” she said. “It doesn’t make sense: You do something positive and then you get something negative in return.”']","After an Arab tahini magnate donated to an Israeli gay rights group, her company faced a boycott.

"Sudan Will Scrap Alcohol and Apostasy Laws, and End Flogging",2020-07-13,By Abdi Latif Dahir,"['NAIROBI, Kenya — Sudan will allow non-Muslims to consume alcohol, scrap its apostasy law and abolish the use of public flogging as a punishment as its transitional government eases decades of strict Islamist policies. The moves, announced late Saturday by the justice minister Nasredeen Abdulbari, are part of a slew of changes introduced under the transitional government as it seeks to break with the rule of Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who was deposed last year after more than three decades in power. The government had already moved to ban the genital cutting of women, a measure that is coming into effect now. The latest announcement came a week after tens of thousands of people took to the streets despite a coronavirus lockdown demanding faster reform and greater civilian rule as the nation takes baby steps toward democracy. “As a government, our work is to protect all Sudanese citizens based on the Constitution and based on laws that should be consistent with the Constitution,” Mr. Abdulbari told state television. The laws being scrapped are legacies of both Mr. al-Bashir and Gaafar al-Nimeiry, an army colonel who led Sudan between 1969 and 1985. In 1983, he imposed Islamic law throughout the nation, precipitating the conflict between the Muslim majority north and the mainly Christian and animist south that led to South Sudan’s secession in 2011. After taking power in 1989, Mr. al-Bashir extended Islamic rule and introduced public order laws that criminalized a wide array of activities and behaviors, including drinking alcohol and wearing revealing clothes for women. Those who contravened the rules faced prison sentences, fines and public lashing. Rights organizations said the laws were “oppressive” and gave the authorities extensive powers to make arbitrary arrests, particularly of women. The apostasy rules in particular drew worldwide condemnation after a heavily pregnant woman was sentenced to death in 2014 for renouncing Islam. The woman, Meriam Ibrahim, gave birth while she was in prison and was later released after organizations including Amnesty International campaigned for her release. Mr. Abdulbari said the government had decided to get rid of the apostasy law because it was “a threat to the security and safety of society.” The repeal is “seen as broadening personal freedoms and is a sharp departure from the previous prohibitive regime,” said David Kiwuwa, director of the Center for Advanced International Studies at the University of Nottingham’s campus in Ningbo, China, who described it as “a strong signal” that Sudan was changing under its civilian authorities. After Mr. al-Bashir was toppled in April 2019 following months of protests, his government was replaced by an 11-member sovereign council consisting of six civilians and five military leaders, tasked with preparing the country for elections after a three-year transition period. The council appointed Abdalla Hamdok, an economist who has held several United Nations positions, as prime minister, and his government immediately embarked on an ambitious program as it sought to placate pro-democracy demonstrators and rejoin the international community. As they moved to dissolve the former governing party of Mr. al-Bashir last November, the authorities also overturned a moral policing law that dictated women’s dress, and in April they approved a ban on genital cutting. Mr. Hamdok’s government has also undertaken a political and economic overhaul, revived talks with rebel groups, and begun investigations into the bloody suppression of the Darfur region under Mr. al-Bashir, promising to prosecute and possibly hand over to the International Criminal Court those wanted for war crimes. The administration has also lobbied the United States to drop Sudan from the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that has restricted investment and foreign aid. Yet despite the good will and heady optimism, Sudan’s political transition remains delicate, buffeted by economic headwinds and restrictions necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Hamdok survived an assassination attempt in March, and concerns of a coup have swirled in recent months. In early July, one person was killed and several others were injured at protests in major cities including the capital, Khartoum, demanding the swift delivery of “freedom, peace and justice.” On Sunday, security forces forcibly dispersed a sit-in in Darfur, which some took as an indication that the military retains the balance of real power. Observers said on Monday that the scrapping of the laws should be read within the broader context of Sudan turning a new page and promoting a more inclusive and representative society. But more would need to be done if the government were to change long-held cultural practices, said Ahmed Soliman, a research fellow at the Africa Program at the British foreign-policy research institute Chatham House. “The transitional government has demonstrated its intent to keep equal citizenship at the forefront of the political transition, including by addressing issues of gender and religious freedoms,” Mr. Soliman said, adding: “There is also division about these reforms, with a strong backlash by conservative religious and political figures who see the changes as an attack on Islam and morality.”']",The moves are part of efforts to broaden personal freedoms during a delicate democratic transition.
Myanmar Plan to Breed Protected Species in Captivity Draws Criticism,2020-07-15,By Richard C. Paddock and Saw Nang,"['BANGKOK — Myanmar will soon adopt rules that would permit captive breeding of about 175 threatened species, including tigers, pangolins and Irrawaddy dolphins, despite fears that such ventures could encourage poaching of wild animals and spawn new diseases that jump to humans. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation quietly circulated a list of wildlife last month that could be raised commercially for display in zoos, tourist attractions or hotels and, in a handful of cases, to produce meat for sale to the public. Government officials assert that the list is aimed at improving wildlife protection by reducing illegal hunting and increasing conservation under a 2018 law. The government is expected to issue detailed rules on commercial breeding in coming months, said U Naing Zaw Htun, the ministry’s director of wildlife conservation. But international conservation groups said the plan could undermine wildlife protection by increasing demand for wild meat and for species used in traditional medicine. “Commercial trade has been shown to increase illegal trade in wildlife by creating a parallel market and boosting overall demand for wild animal products,” the World Wildlife Fund and Fauna and Flora International said in a joint statement questioning the government plan. The list posted on government websites identifies 89 species of mammals, birds and reptiles, including such rare creatures as the helmeted hornbill, the Bengal slow loris and the white-handed gibbon. The list also includes a reference to snakes as a broad category. At least 100 snake species in Myanmar are threatened, including the Burmese python, the spitting cobra and the Russell’s viper, said U Kyi Soe Lwin, manager of the privately run Yangon Zoological Garden. Conservationists contend that commercial breeding of protected wildlife would undermine efforts to protect endangered species. Captive breeding has little conservation value, they say, because such animals are rarely suited for release in the wild. Animal experts and conservationists said that at least 175 of the species covered by the list are considered threatened in Myanmar or globally. It is unclear whether the rules would allow endangered animals to be captured in the wild. Under the ministry’s plan, eight species can be commercially farmed for meat, including at least one that is listed as threatened in Myanmar — the estuarine, or saltwater, crocodile. Mr. Naing Zaw Htun, the government official, defended the inclusion of the crocodile because breeding it for its meat and skin is already permitted. Keeping wildlife for human consumption, especially in crowded Asian markets, has been linked to viruses that have infected humans, including the coronavirus that has caused the current pandemic and SARS, which emerged in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide. Conservationists and health experts have urged governments around the world to curb consumption of wild meat, or bush meat, as it is sometimes known. “Commercial wildlife breeding and trade can also increase the risk of disease spillover from wildlife to humans, such as Covid-19,” the World Wildlife Fund and Fauna and Flora International said. The pangolin, which at one point was suspected of playing a part in the transmission of the new coronavirus, could be bred in Myanmar zoos under the new regulations. Both of the country’s species, the Sunda pangolin and the Chinese pangolin, are critically endangered, said U Nay Myo Shwe, a wildlife expert with Fauna and Flora International. Permitting captive breeding of tigers in Myanmar could open a new base of operations for illegal tiger traders. In much of Southeast Asia, demand for tiger parts in traditional Chinese medicine and human encroachment have put tremendous pressure on the species. Conservationists say that a flourishing market in tiger parts gives poachers an incentive to hunt wild tigers and sell them. In Myanmar, scientists have identified 22 individual tigers in the wild and estimate that no more than 50 survive in two fragmented habitats, giving the species little chance of long-term survival. Edwin Wiek, the founder of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said he expected investors seeking to establish tiger farms in Myanmar would obtain animals from China and Laos, where enforcement is relatively lax. Another endangered species on the government’s list is the Irrawaddy dolphin. Mr. Nay Myo Shwe, the wildlife expert, said only about 75 of the freshwater dolphins survive in Myanmar, where they inhabit the Irrawaddy River for which they are named. None are in captivity, he said, and so the only way to begin commercial breeding would be to capture a pair. “Putting dolphins in zoos would be like having them live in lockdown conditions,” he said. “The nature of the dolphin is they like to range freely in a very wide area, not in a limited area like a zoo.” Similarly, he questioned the inclusion of the helmeted hornbill, which is so critically endangered that its numbers are unknown. Like the dolphin, none are kept in captivity, so commercial breeding would mean capturing them. The helmeted hornbill, which lives in Myanmar’s dwindling pristine forests, has long been sought for its large horn, which is prized for carving and is sometimes used in China as a substitute for ivory.']","Myanmar’s conservation ministry is considering captive breeding of as many as 175 threatened species, including tigers, Irrawaddy dolphins and rare birds that exist only in the wild."
Bahrain to Execute 2 Shiite Protesters After Years of Desperate Appeals,2020-07-13,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — Two Bahraini men who say they were tortured into making false confessions were sentenced to death for the fifth time on Monday in what international rights groups called another stain on Bahrain’s record of imprisoning, torturing and executing government critics. The two men, both members of Bahrain’s Shiite majority, were first arrested and tried for a bombing that killed a police officer in 2014. They faced execution even after a Bahraini internal investigation found medical evidence that one had been tortured. “They’d beat me up. I’d go up again and deny,”  said Husain Moosa, one of the defendants, describing his interrogation to a rights activist in a January recording reviewed by The New York Times. After the third beating by an interrogator, Mr. Moosa recalled, “ I told him, ‘I’ll say what you want. What do you want me to say?’” Bahrain, a tiny island kingdom off the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf, has a majority-Shiite population but is ruled by a Sunni monarchy, leading to occasional protests and violence against government security forces. Since 2011, when it turned to Saudi Arabia to help quash a Shiite revolt, the Bahraini government has prosecuted a growing number of Shiite leaders and activists. The kingdom carried out 10 executions in the six decades before 2017, then six in just the past three years, according to Reprieve, a Britain-based rights group that provides legal support to people facing the death penalty. Reports of detainees tortured into confessing with electric shocks, extreme cold and sexual abuse are common. Bahrain’s government has established two oversight agencies to investigate misconduct allegations against its security forces, funding them with the help of Britain, which has supplied Bahrain’s security and justice system with millions of pounds since 2012. The kingdom is also a longtime ally of the United States and hosts the Navy’s Fifth Fleet. “To Western partners, Bahrain promises human rights reform,” said Maya Foa, Reprieve’s director. “To citizens, it threatens that if you speak out, you will be imprisoned, tortured and convicted of crimes you did not commit.” Mr. Moosa and the other man sentenced on Monday, Mohammed Ramadhan, were arrested in February 2014 after a bomb detonated in the village of Al Dair, near Bahrain’s international airport, while policemen in the area were breaking up a riot, according to prosecutors. One officer was killed, and several others injured. Prosecutors identified Mr. Moosa and Mr. Ramadhan, who faced several terrorism-related charges. Mr. Moosa, 34, a hotel driver, later said that interrogators handcuffed and repeatedly beat him on his back, face and genitals. In pain, he eventually confessed, implicating Mr. Ramadhan, a 37-year-old airport policeman. “The most tormenting thing was being hit on my testicles just to say that it was Mohammed,” Mr. Moosa recounted in the January recording. “They hit me with their shoes, and two people would come and make me lie on the floor and they would touch the testicles. One person would grab my thighs to open my legs completely and the other person would press the testicles.” Mr. Moosa has said his wrists were zip-tied, causing them to swell so much that his interrogators had to hospitalize him. Zahra Moosa, Mr. Moosa’s sister, said that injuries were “obvious on his hands and his back” when she visited him in prison in 2014. “It’s impossible that my brother would do something like killing,” she added. “He’s just a peaceful protester.” Mr. Ramadhan said that during his interrogation, security officials touched his buttocks and forced him to stand for hours in a frigid room. They also threatened to sexually assault his wife and sisters in front of him, he said. A father of three who had previously marched in peaceful pro-democracy protests, Mr. Ramadhan has said his interrogators acknowledged that his political activism made him a target for prosecution. He confessed to protesting, but refused to sign a confession claiming responsibility for the bombing. “They literally told me that they were waiting for a major case to frame me in it,” he told his wife from prison on July 4, according to a recording of the call. “They said they knew about my participation in protests and demonstrations, and that I betrayed the government.” Sentenced to death in December 2014, the men have appealed several times, and each time their convictions have stood. Their one break came when, under international pressure over the case, a Bahraini oversight agency announced that it had found a doctor’s report documenting injuries on Mr. Moosa’s wrists that raised the “suspicion that he was subjected to assault and mistreatment.” That report, the review said, had been overlooked during the initial trial. Based on the internal review, Bahrain’s high court overturned the two men’s death sentences in October 2018, but a lower court reinstated them in January of this year. The high court reaffirmed the verdict on Monday. Bahrain has not announced when the two men will be executed. Once the king signs off, however, execution is imminent. In a statement, an official in Bahrain’s public prosecution office, Haroon Al Zayani, said the convictions were based on victim and witness testimony, physical evidence and technical and forensic reports, none of which he described. He said the evidence also included text messages on the defendants’ phones showing them planning to commit the crimes. The medical reports documenting Mr. Moosa’s injuries are not “in line with the procedures of the police nor the public prosecution” office, Mr. Al Zayani said. He said the confessions were made “with full consciousness and voluntarily, without any physical or verbal coercion,” and that the men were convicted with “all the requirements of a fair trial.” The men’s supporters and rights groups have drawn the opposite conclusion, arguing that Bahrain’s courts have been turned into a tool for the kingdom’s crackdown on political opponents. “I know that no one is listening to me because I do not have much money, I do not have many possessions and I am not famous. However, I want my voice to be heard,” Mr. Ramadhan said in the July call to his wife. “I am innocent of the crime of which I was accused, subjected to a sham trial and sentenced to death.” Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.']",The men were convicted of a bombing that killed a police officer in 2014.

"Hong Kong Voters Defy Beijing, Endorsing Protest Leaders in Primary",2020-07-13,"By Austin Ramzy, Elaine Yu and Tiffany May","['HONG KONG — Defying warnings from local officials that the Hong Kong opposition’s unofficial primary vote could be illegal under a sweeping new security law, hundreds of thousands of people chose avowedly pro-democracy candidates to run in citywide elections this year, results released Monday showed. Early returns showed that the more than 600,000 people who had voted favored candidates who were prominent supporters of the months of demonstrations that have gripped the semiautonomous Chinese city. Their choices indicated a desire to see the goals of the protest movement pressed within the government itself, but could lead to an intensifying confrontation with the authorities, who could bar some from running. “So many people came out to vote despite the threat that it may violate the national security law,” said Lester Shum, a 27-year-old activist and candidate who was among the front-runners on Monday. “That means Hong Kong people have still not given up.” Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement has been hobbled by mass arrests at protests and by the new security law, which bans vaguely defined crimes of secession, subversion and terrorism and is already working to mute dissent. The one remaining avenue of resisting Beijing’s tightening grip over the city, they say, is to capture a majority in the legislature in September. The obstacles are enormous. Hong Kong’s electoral system has long been weighted heavily in favor of the establishment that is backed by the Chinese Communist Party. Pro-Beijing parties are far better funded than the opposition. Now they must contend with the new, far-reaching national security law imposed by the central Chinese government that makes speaking out against the authorities possibly criminal. Opposition candidates, whose calls for democratic freedoms could be deemed as hostile to China’s ruling Communist Party, say they fear that whoever has protested the law could be disqualified from running or jailed. Even if they did succeed in being elected, there was no guarantee that the party would let them govern. Supporters of the democratic camp have been grappling with whether to rely on familiar, moderate politicians or to abandon them in favor of more confrontational candidates — and those disagreements have threatened to divide the vote. The informal primary this past weekend to help determine who should run in September sought to avoid such a split. Among those in the lead were activists such as Joshua Wong, who led the large street demonstrations in 2014 for freer elections, and Ted Hui and Roy Kwong, young lawmakers who often tried to mediate between protesters and the police during last year’s unrest. “They are in favor of electing people who have a strong record in the protest movement so that they can continue the protests” within the legislative body, said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Those who have strong recognition in the protests stand out, irrespective of their parties.” The turnout represented more than half of the opposition’s votes in 2016, and was several times higher than the organizers had expected. Voters went to polling stations set up on sidewalks as well as in unconventional venues such as a lingerie shop and a converted double-decker bus. Joyce Leung, a 35-year-old mother of two young children, said that she had decided to vote for candidates who regularly attended the protests even though they were at risk of exclusion from competing. “I think they will definitely be disqualified,” she said on Sunday, after having cast a vote at a sidewalk polling station on Hong Kong Island surrounded by tenement buildings, office towers and coffee shops. “But I still wanted to show them that a lot of people are supporting them.” Hong Kong’s electoral system has never been equal. Britain had little interest in democracy when it ran the city, and China quickly undermined a pledge that the entire legislature would be elected, by maintaining the British colonial system of limited voting.  Just half of the 70 seats in the legislature represent geographical districts that are directly elected by voters. The other half are so-called functional constituencies, most chosen by corporate voting and more likely to go to establishment candidates. That tilted system has historically discouraged some Hong Kong residents from participating. But in November, after months of fierce and at times violent antigovernment protests, voters turned out in large numbers for an election of Hong Kong’s district councilors, a low-level office that previously drew little attention. More than seven in 10 eligible voters cast ballots, compared to a previous high of 47 percent — and delivered a stunning victory for the pro-democracy camp, which swept 86 percent of the seats. That victory shocked Beijing and emboldened protesters to set their eyes on the more ambitious target of elections for the Legislative Council, a far more powerful body. Their goal has taken on extra urgency as other displays of dissent have become increasingly perilous under the new security law. Sage Ip, a 29-year-old flight attendant who cast her ballot on Sunday in the Sai Ying Pun district, said she voted in the primary because she was worried that she would never get a chance to do so again. “Voting is something that is still within our capacity. We can’t express ourselves at protests anymore.” The police now regularly ban marches, citing violence and coronavirus-prevention measures, and sweep up hundreds of demonstrators in mass arrests. “To cast your vote, you do not need to risk your life,” Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong and leading strategist for the opposition, said in June. “It is a form of protest that actually is risk-less, I would say. So why not? Why not use your vote to buy a chance?” Gwyneth Ho, a 29-year-old former journalist who emerged as a front-runner in her district on Monday, has urged pro-democracy supporters to keep fighting, no matter the odds. “We all know, we do something not because it’s effective, or because it’ll succeed,” she called out to commuters streaming past her outside a busy subway station on a recent Wednesday late last month. “It’s because we can’t give up on any front.” If the pro-democracy candidates were able to capture a majority in the legislature, they could use their position to block the government’s agenda. Some have proposed vetoing the government’s budget, which could force the dissolution of the legislature. If a new legislature were also to block the budget, the chief executive would be forced to step down. Erick Tsang, the constitutional affairs secretary, warned last week that the pro-democracy camp’s primary could potentially be considered subversion under the new national security law if its goal were to form a majority to block the Hong Kong government’s policies. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, repeated Mr. Tsang’s warning on Monday night. Beijing’s representative office in Hong Kong was more strident, declaring in a statement late Monday that the primary was “nakedly illegal behavior” that caused “serious damage to the fairness and justice” of the legislative elections. It singled out Mr. Tai, the opposition strategist, for criticism, accusing him of working at the behest of unnamed forces. “The goal of the Benny Tai gang and the opposition is to seize the power of governance in Hong Kong and deliberately stage the Hong Kong version of the ‘color revolution,’” the office said, referring to anti-Communist uprisings China says are orchestrated by the West. “He was so openly manipulating the election. Whose instructions did he receive? Who gave him such confidence?” The pro-democracy camp’s electoral push also displayed rifts within the opposition movement. A few candidates who champion more aggressive tactics refused to participate in the pro-democracy camp’s primary, arguing that voters should be able to choose from the full range of candidates in September. More moderate voices have argued that voters needed to be strategic rather than ideological, and should rally behind the candidates most likely to win. A significant threat looms over all the pro-democracy camp’s plans: disqualification. In the last legislative election, several candidates were barred from competing over questions of whether they acknowledged Beijing’s position that Hong Kong was an “inalienable part” of China. Six who won later lost their seats because they protested against China during their oaths of office. This year, many in the opposition fear that election officials will also bar candidates who have questioned the new security law. Mr. Shum, who campaigned at the street booth with Ms. Ho, said his ultimate goal was for the pro-democracy camp to win so many seats that Beijing would be forced to take drastic action in response, such as disqualifying all the elected lawmakers. He said he hoped that such extreme action would then provoke an international response in support of the protesters. But others warn that any large-scale rejection of pro-democracy candidates by the government could cause Hong Kong to erupt. “This time around we are talking about the possibility of getting more than half the seats, but I think the reality is we may not be allowed to participate in the election at all,” said Fernando Cheung, a veteran opposition lawmaker who is stepping down this year. “If that is to happen, the anger and the frustration would be extreme,” he said. “I’m afraid the confrontation would be much worse.”']",Voters turned out in high numbers to cast ballots in an unofficial primary for the city’s pro-democracy camp despite government warnings it might be against the new security law.
China Vows to Retaliate After Trump Signs Hong Kong Sanctions Bill,2020-07-15,By Steven Lee Myers,"['China on Wednesday sharply criticized President Trump’s moves to strip Hong Kong of its preferential trading status with the United States and clear the way for new sanctions on officials and companies there, vowing to retaliate with punitive measures of its own. The response from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing promised to continue a pattern of tit-for-tat punishments that have accompanied the sharp downward turn in relations between the two countries on a variety of fronts, from trade to technology to human rights. China was swift to criticize Mr. Trump’s latest actions, which he announced at a rambling White House news conference on Tuesday. Those moves, along with his remarks, underscored the extent to which relations with Beijing have become intertwined with the American presidential election. Mr. Trump said he had issued an executive order revoking the special trading status that Hong Kong had enjoyed for more than two decades, following the Chinese government’s imposition of a sweeping new national security law there.  The law came into force on June 30, and its chilling effect on political freedoms in the city — which, under a formula called “one country, two systems,” is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy from China — has already been evident in a series of arrests and police raids. Mr. Trump also signed legislation, adopted overwhelmingly in May by Congress, that authorizes the administration to impose sanctions on officials or institutions, including banks, that were found to have undermined Hong Kong’s semiautonomous status.  His executive order, besides revoking the territory’s special trading status, calls for sanctions against people deemed to have been involved in a variety of acts in Hong Kong, including arrests made under the new security law and actions that undermine democratic processes or limit the news media’s freedoms. Officials in Beijing had clearly anticipated the moves, but they reacted harshly nonetheless. “The act on the United States side maliciously denigrates Hong Kong’s national security legislation, threatens to impose sanctions on China and gravely violates international law and basic rules of international relations,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement posted on Wednesday morning in China, not long after Mr. Trump finished speaking.  “It is gross interference in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs,” the ministry said. The Hong Kong government said in a statement that the United States was “using human rights, democracy and autonomy as an excuse” to introduce measures aimed at attacking China.  The impact of the new powers detailed in the American law and Mr. Trump’s executive order remains to be seen. Congress has authorized similar measures before, only to have the administration delay imposing them as it weighed other foreign policy considerations, including Mr. Trump’s signature trade deal with China. With relations deteriorating badly and the pandemic’s toll mounting in the United States, the administration has acted more aggressively in recent weeks. When the United States imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials over China’s crackdown on Uighurs and other Muslims in the far western region of Xinjiang, Beijing reciprocated by announcing travel bans and sanctions on prominent Republican members of Congress. Lau Siu-kai, a senior adviser to the Chinese government on Hong Kong policy, said the American actions would have limited effect on Hong Kong and would, contrary to the intent of the United States, drive the territory closer to mainland China. “The overall damage to Hong Kong and to China is rather minimal and can be absorbed,” said Mr. Lau, a former senior Hong Kong government official who is now with the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies. He said Hong Kong was becoming “increasingly detached from the United States and the West, and increasingly attached to China and Asia.” Others said the American actions could have more significant effects by hurting the city’s reputation for openness and rule of law. That could affect companies as well as academia.  “The only way we can regain the respect and favorable conditions that we deserve is if Beijing fulfills its original promise to the world and Hong Kong people, which is the genuine implementation of ‘one country, two systems’ and our high degree of autonomy,” said James To, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker.

Ireland Has a New Coronavirus Fear: Americans Who Flout Quarantine,2020-07-14,By Megan Specia,"['Janet Cavanagh, whose electric bike tour company offers a guided glimpse of western Ireland’s windswept landscape, saw her business come to a swift halt — along with nearly everything else — as the coronavirus pandemic forced the country into lockdown. She recently reopened her doors, eager to restart business and make up for lost time as restrictions eased. But she and a number of other business owners say that Ireland faces a new and unexpected threat: Tourists, particularly American ones, who flout Ireland’s quarantine rule. With the pandemic still raging unabated in much of the United States, unlike in Europe, Americans are among those most likely to be infected. They aren’t the only tourists ignoring the requirement that people arriving in Ireland isolate themselves for 14 days, but most of the public complaints involve Americans. Last weekend, Ms. Cavanagh canceled a guided tour for two people who had just arrived from the United States and didn’t think Ireland’s travel quarantine applied to them. She said she felt the responsibility to turn them away for the safety of her staff and community. “You don’t want to be responsible for endangering anybody here, because you have to live here,” she said, adding that it was simply not worth the risk. Simon Haden, the owner of Gregans Castle Hotel in County Clare, in the west of Ireland, said he recently received a call from Americans who wanted to book a reservation in his restaurant soon after arriving, and who had no plans to quarantine. He explained the situation to them, and turned them away. In recent days, dozens of Irish businesses — tour operators, restaurateurs and pub owners — have posted on social media similar stories about fending off customers who had just landed in the country but were ignoring directions to self-isolate. A national radio station, Newstalk, interviewed Americans arriving at Dublin airport, some of whom said they had no plans to quarantine. That has ignited a national conversation about whether the government, which does not monitor compliance with the isolation order or penalize violators, should start enforcing it. Many people in Ireland say the government should be tougher about preventing travelers from bringing the virus into the country, but the government has tried to tamp down that concern. The Irish leader, or taoiseach, Micheal Martin, told Ireland’s parliament on Tuesday that while there had been much conversation about American tourists, “the numbers are quite low coming in from the U.S.” Simon Coveney, the foreign affairs minister, acknowledged on Monday that there was evidence of visitors who had ignored quarantine laws in the country. But he said just 200 to 250 people a day had arrived in Ireland from the United States, most of whom he described as “Irish people coming home.” “We need to put this in perspective,” he said, but he added that “people should not be coming to Ireland if they can’t restrict their movement.” The issue has created a painful paradox for suffering business owners who rely heavily on American customers but feel compelled to turn them away. Visitors from the United States are usually the largest source of tourism revenue on the island of Ireland — both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom — accounting for 28 percent of foreign spending in 2018, according to Tourism Ireland. “The first thing I want to see is American guests return,” Mr. Haden said. “But not if it’s going to put the health and safety of our guests, our staff, the community under threat after the sacrifices we’ve made.” Those sacrifices included a stringent, monthslong lockdown that drove down the rate of new infections from almost 1,000 a day in mid-April to just 20 per day. Overall, Ireland has had more than 25,000 confirmed cases and 1,746 deaths. Ireland’s pubs, restaurants and hotels were finally allowed to reopen on June 29, but under tight regulations that require social distancing and limit the number of patrons at a given time. So just as people in Ireland have begun to move more freely, many of them fear losing the gains they have made. JP McMahon, a well-known, Michelin-starred chef, wrote on Twitter on Saturday night that a group of people from Texas dined at one of his restaurants in Galway, and while he was unclear if they had undertaken a two-week quarantine, staff were “very uncomfortable.” “This is not just an American problem,” he said in an interview. “We had Germans in today in our cafe who arrived yesterday, who felt that because their country had a low rate of infection it was OK.” He also worries that Irish people returning from abroad will neglect quarantine. Mr. McMahon has taken matters into his own hands, saying on Sunday that all international visitors booking into his restaurants would be required to prove their entry date into the country. At the height of the coronavirus crisis in Europe, Ireland, a European Union member, did not adopt the bloc’s blanket ban on nonessential travelers from outside it, or the kind of border controls erected by many European countries. Though most of the European Union has resumed allowing in some foreign visitors, it has continued to bar most people from the United States. The Irish government merely advises against nonessential travel to the country, but does not prohibit it, a policy set to be reviewed on July 20. Everyone arriving from abroad — visitors, residents and citizens alike — is told to quarantine for 14 days, and must complete a form stating where they will be staying during that time. There are currently no fines for breaking quarantine, but a traveler could face a fine of up to 2,500 euros or imprisonment for up to 6 months for not completing the form upon arrival or providing false or misleading information on it. Sam McConkey, an associate professor and head of the department of international health and tropical medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), said that because Ireland had chosen not to close its borders, adherence to and enforcement of the country’s self-isolation rules was essential. Speaking to the national broadcaster RTE, he said it was the only viable option. Some opposition politicians have also called for more extreme measures, including Duncan Smith, the transport spokesman for the Labour party, who on Monday said he wanted to suspend flights from the United States and other areas considered “Covid-19 hot spots” until mandatory testing could be put in place at Irish airports. Leo Varadkar, the former leader who guided the country through the first wave of the pandemic and now serves as the deputy head of government, said a mandatory quarantine “is not possible in Ireland.” Speaking to RTE on Tuesday, he cited legal concerns and pointed to outbreaks at Australia’s quarantine hotels as evidence against such measures. Ms. Cavanagh, who owns E-Whizz bikes in Clare, said in a typical year, around 90 percent of her business would come from the United States. But for now, she has put the thought of profit aside for the sake of safety, urging international travelers to self-isolate for the full two weeks. “So unless you have that kind of time to play with, we’d rather you didn’t come because we don’t want you to be mixing around in the community,” she said.']","The government is under fire for not enforcing the rule that people arriving self-isolate for 14 days. With the pandemic still raging in the United States, concern has focused on Americans."
White Supremacist Who Admitted Christchurch Killings Plans to Represent Himself,2020-07-13,By Isabella Kwai,"['An Australian white supremacist who pleaded guilty to killing 51 worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand last year plans to represent himself at a sentencing hearing in August, a court heard on Monday, raising concerns that he might use the proceedings to push his views and traumatize the survivors once again. The white supremacist, Brenton Tarrant, initially denied involvement before pleading guilty in March to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism for the killing spree in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. The massacre, the deadliest shooting in New Zealand’s history, led the government to ban most semiautomatic weapons and spurred an effort to restrict racist and violent content on the internet. The gunman had posted a white-supremacist manifesto online and live-streamed part of the shootings on Facebook. On Monday, a judge at Christchurch’s High Court confirmed that Mr. Tarrant, who appeared via video link from Auckland Prison, had waived his rights to legal representation before allowing his lawyers, Jonathan Hudson and Shane Tait, to withdraw from the case, according to the local news media. “We are not disappointed by Mr. Tarrant’s decision,” Mr. Hudson said, according to The New Zealand Herald. “There has been no conflict or relationship breakdown.”  Instead, the court will appoint a lawyer on standby should Mr. Tarrant choose to be represented later. By representing himself, Mr. Tarrant will be entitled to speak at the sentencing, although the judge has the power to determine what is relevant to the hearing, Len Andersen, the president of the New Zealand Criminal Bar Association, told the local news outlet Stuff. But that would most likely not include any attempt to share white-supremacist views. “Since he has accepted he is a terrorist and there is no difference for sentencing purposes what his ideology is, I expect the judge will say any such comments are irrelevant and stop him,” said Kris Gledhill, a professor of law at Auckland University of Technology. Mr. Tarrant’s sentencing has been set for Aug. 24, with the hearing expected to last several days as victims who survived the shooting and relatives of those killed give impact statements. The victims’ families and members of the Muslim community said that Mr. Tarrant’s move was an attempt to grab attention and could retraumatize them if he spoke during an event widely seen as a chance for them to find closure. “The whole sentencing isn’t about him; it’s about the impact on the community,” Anjum Rahman, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women’s Council in New Zealand, told Stuff. “Why give him airtime?” Another man sentenced last month for storming a mosque in Norway said he had been inspired by Mr. Tarrant’s hate-filled manifesto. With travel bans still in place because of the coronavirus pandemic, the government also said on Friday that it would grant exceptions to allow victims of the mosque attacks and their families who are overseas to attend the sentencing, and work to provide technology options for others to read victim-impact statements remotely.']",There is concern that the Australian who pleaded guilty to killing 51 worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand last year would use the occasion to spout his views.
"Caught in ‘Ideological Spiral,’ U.S. and China Drift Toward Cold War",2020-07-14,By Steven Lee Myers and Paul Mozur,"['One by one, the United States has hit at the core tenets of Xi Jinping’s vision for a rising China ready to assume the mantle of superpower. In a matter of weeks, the Trump administration has imposed sanctions over punitive policies in Hong Kong and China’s western region of Xinjiang. It took new measures to suffocate Chinese innovation by cutting it off from American technology and pushing allies to look elsewhere. On Monday, it challenged China’s claims in the South China Sea, setting the stage for sharper confrontation. And President Trump said on Tuesday that he had signed into law a bill to punish Chinese officials for the new security law that curbs the rights of Hong Kong residents, along with an executive order ending preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong. “The power gap is closing, and the ideological gap is widening,” said Rush Doshi, director of the China Strategy Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Washington, adding that China and the United States had entered a downward “ideological spiral” years in the making. “Where’s the bottom?” he asked. For years, officials and historians have dismissed the idea that a new Cold War was emerging between the United States and China. The contours of today’s world, the argument went, are simply incomparable to the decades when the United States and the Soviet Union squared off in an existential struggle for supremacy. The world was said to be too interconnected to easily divide into ideological blocs. Now, lines are being drawn and relations are in free fall, laying the foundation for a confrontation that will have many of the characteristics of the Cold War — and the dangers. As the two superpowers clash over technology, territory and clout, they face the same risk of small disputes escalating into military conflict. The relationship is increasingly imbued with deep distrust and animosity, as well as the fraught tensions that come with two powers jockeying for primacy, especially in areas where their interests collide: in cyberspace and outer space, in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, and even in the Persian Gulf.  And the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with China’s recent aggressive actions on its borders — from the Pacific to the Himalayas — has turned existing fissures into chasms that could be difficult to overcome, no matter the outcome of this year’s American presidential election. From Beijing’s perspective, it is the United States that has plunged relations to what China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said last week was their lowest point since the countries re-established diplomatic relations in 1979. “The current China policy of the United States is based on ill-informed strategic miscalculation and is fraught with emotions and whims and McCarthyist bigotry,” Mr. Wang said, evoking the Cold War himself to describe the current level of tensions. “It seems as if every Chinese investment is politically driven, every Chinese student is a spy and every cooperation initiative is a scheme with a hidden agenda,” he added. Domestic politics in both countries have hardened views and given ammunition to hawks. “What cooperation is there between China and the United States right now?” said Zheng Yongnian, director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore. “I can’t see any substantial cooperation.” The pandemic, too, has inflamed tensions, especially in the United States. Mr. Trump  refers to the coronavirus with racist tropes, while Beijing accuses his administration of attacking China to detract from its failures to contain the virus. Mr. Trump, in a statement delivered from the Rose Garden Tuesday evening that focused harshly on China and his presidential rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., referred to the pandemic as “the plague pouring in from China,” and said that the Chinese “could have stopped it.” Both countries are forcing other nations to take sides, even if they are disinclined to do so. The Trump administration, for example, has pressed allies — with some success in Australia and, on Tuesday, in Britain — to forswear the Chinese tech giant Huawei as they develop 5G networks. China, facing condemnation over its policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, has rallied countries to make public demonstrations of support for them. At the United Nations Humans Rights Council in Geneva, 53 nations — from Belarus to Zimbabwe — signed a statement supporting China’s new security law for Hong Kong. Only 27 nations on the council criticized it, most of them European democracies, along with Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Such blocs would not have been unfamiliar at the height of the Cold War. China has also wielded its vast economic power as a tool of political coercion, cutting off imports of beef and barley from Australia because its government called for an international investigation into the origins of the pandemic. On Tuesday, Beijing said it would sanction the American aerospace manufacturer Lockheed Martin over recent weapons sales to Taiwan. With the world distracted by the pandemic, China has also wielded its military might, as it did by testing its disputed frontier with India in April and May. That led to the first deadly clash there since 1975. The damage to the relationship could take years to repair. Increasingly, China seems willing to accept the risks of such actions. Only weeks later, it asserted a new territorial claim in Bhutan, the mountain kingdom that is closely allied with India. With China menacing vessels from Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia in the South China Sea, the United States dispatched two aircraft carriers through the waters last month in an aggressive show of strength. Further brinkmanship appears inevitable now that the State Department has declared China’s claims there illegal. A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, said on Tuesday that the American declaration would undermine regional peace and stability, asserting that China had controlled the islands in the sea “for thousands of years,” which is not true. As he stated, the Republic of China — then controlled by the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek — only made a formal claim in 1948. “China is committed to resolving territorial and jurisdictional disputes with directly related sovereign states through negotiations and consultations,” he said. That is not how its neighbors see things. Japan warned this week that China was attempting to “alter the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea.” It called China a more serious long-term threat than a nuclear-armed North Korea. Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia and professor of international studies at Stanford University, said China’s recent maneuvering appeared to be “overextended and overreaching,” likening it to one of the most fraught moments of the Cold War. “It does remind me of Khrushchev,” he said. “He’s lashing out, and suddenly he’s in a Cuban missile crisis with the U.S.” A backlash against Beijing appears to be growing. The tensions are particularly clear in tech, where China has sought to compete with the world in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and microchips, while harshly restricting what people can read, watch or listen to inside the country. If the Berlin Wall was the physical symbol of the first Cold War, the Great Firewall could well be the virtual symbol of the new one. What began as a divide in cyberspace to insulate Chinese citizens from views not authorized by the Communist Party has now proved to be a prescient indicator of the deeper fissures between China and much of the Western world. Mr. Wang, in his speech, said China had never sought to impose its way on other countries. But it has done exactly that by getting Zoom to censor talks that were being held in the United States and by launching cyberattacks on Uighurs across the globe. Its controls have been hugely successful at home in stifling dissent and helping to seed domestic internet giants, but they have won China little influence abroad. India’s move to block 59 Chinese apps threatens to hobble China’s biggest overseas internet success to date, the meme-laden short-video app TikTok. Last week, TikTok also shut down in Hong Kong because of China’s new national security law there. The American tech giants Facebook, Google and Twitter said they would stop reviewing data requests from the Hong Kong authorities as they assessed the law’s restrictions. “China is big, it will be successful, it will develop its own tech, but there are limits to what it can do,” said James A. Lewis, a former American official who writes on cybersecurity and espionage for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  Even in places where China has succeeded in selling its technology, the tide appears to be turning. Beijing’s recent truculence has now led the United Kingdom to block new Huawei equipment from going into its networks, and the Trump administration is determined to cut the company off from microchips and other components it needs. To counter, Beijing has redoubled efforts to build homegrown options. Calls for a total decoupling of China’s supply chain from American tech companies are unrealistic in the short term, and would prove massively expensive in the longer term. Still, the United States has moved to pull Taiwan’s microchip manufacturing — crucial to the supply chains of Huawei and other Chinese tech companies — closer to its backyard, with plans to support a new Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing plant in Arizona. Mr. Wang, the foreign minister, urged the United States to step back and seek areas where the two countries can work together. Pessimism about the relationship is nonetheless widespread, though most Chinese officials and analysts blame the Trump administration for trying to deflect attention from its failure to control the pandemic. “It is not difficult to see that under the impact of the coronavirus in this U.S. election year various powers in the U.S. are focused on China,” Zhao Kejin, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University, wrote in a recent paper. “The China-U.S. relationship faces the most serious moment since the establishment of diplomatic relations.” While he eschewed the idea of a new Cold War, his alternative phrasing was no more reassuring: “The new reality is China-U.S. relations are not entering ‘a new Cold War’ but sliding into a ‘soft war.’” Reporting and research were contributed by Claire Fu in Beijing, Lin Qiqing in Shanghai and Motoko Rich in Tokyo.']","Relations are in free fall. Lines are being drawn. As the two superpowers clash over technology, territory and clout, a new geopolitical era is dawning."
"A Racial Awakening in France, Where Race Is a Taboo Topic",2020-07-14,By Norimitsu Onishi,"['PARIS — Growing up in France, Maboula Soumahoro never thought of herself as Black. At home, her immigrant parents stressed the culture of the Dioula, a Muslim ethnic group from Ivory Coast in West Africa. In her neighborhood, she identified herself as Ivorian to other children of African immigrants. It was only as a teenager — years after the discovery of Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, “The Cosby Show” and hip-hop made her “dream of being cool like African-Americans’’ — that she began feeling a racial affinity with her friends, she said. “We were all children of immigrants from Guadeloupe, Martinique, Africa, and we are all a little bit unlike our parents,’’ recalled Ms. Soumahoro, 44, an expert on race who lived in the United States for a decade. “We were French in our new way and we weren’t white French. It was different in our homes, but we found one another regardless, and that’s when you become Black.’’ Besides fueling heated debates over racism, the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis has underscored the emergence of a new way of thinking about race in the public discourse in France, a nation where discussion of race and religion has traditionally been muted in favor of elevating a colorblind ideal that all people share the same universal rights. That ideal has often fallen short in reality, especially as French society has become more diverse and discrimination remains entrenched, leading some to wonder whether the universalist model has run its course. Today it is being challenged perhaps most vociferously by the many Black French who have gone through a racial awakening in recent decades — helped by the pop culture of the United States, its thinkers, and even its Paris-based diplomats who spotted and encouraged young Black French leaders a decade ago. To its opponents, Black and white, the challenge to the universalist tradition is perceived as part of the broader “Americanization” of French society. This challenge risks fragmenting France, they say, and poses a threat far more central to the modern republic’s founding principles than familiar complaints about the encroachment of McDonald’s or Hollywood blockbusters. Even those Black French who have been inspired by the United States also consider America to be a deeply flawed and violently racist society. In France, people of different backgrounds mix far more freely, and while Black people occupy fewer high-profile positions than in the United States, like all French citizens they enjoy universal access to education, health care and other services. “When I consider both countries, I’m not saying that one country is better than the other,” said Ms. Soumahoro, who has taught African-American studies at Columbia and now teaches at the Université de Tours. “For me, they’re two racist societies that manage racism in their own way.” Most of France’s new thinkers on race are the children of immigrants from the former colonial empire. Growing up in households with a strong sense of their separate ethnic identities, they gradually began to develop a shared sense of racial consciousness in their neighborhoods and schools. Pap Ndiaye — a historian who led efforts to establish Black studies as an academic discipline in France with the 2008 publication of his book “La Condition Noire,” or “The Black Condition’’ — said he grew aware of his race only after studying in the United States in the 1990s. “It’s an experience that all Black French go through when they go to the United States,” said Mr. Ndiaye, 54, who teaches at Sciences Po. “It’s the experience of a country where skin color is reflected upon and where it is not hidden behind a colorblind discourse.” The son of a Senegalese father and a Frenchwoman, Mr. Ndiaye is a “métis” in the French context, or of mixed race, though he identifies himself as a Black man. His views of the world and himself were a radical challenge to the French state. Rooted in the Enlightenment and the Revolution, France’s universalism has long held that each human being enjoys fundamental rights like equality and liberty. In keeping with the belief that no group should be given preference, it remains illegal to collect data on race for the census and for almost all other official purposes. But the unequal treatment of women in France and of nonwhite people throughout its colonies belied that universalist ideal. “Universality could work easily enough when there weren’t too many immigrants or when they were white Catholics,” said Gérard Araud, France’s former ambassador to the United States. “But faced with Islam on one side and Black Africans on the other, this model has evidently reached its limits. And so the debate is that on one side is this universalism, which is a beautiful ideal, but on the other is how to say at the same time that, yes, it’s not working.” Tania de Montaigne, a French author who has written about race, said that Black French will fully integrate only through the rule of law and citizenship. Emphasizing a racial identity, she said, would make Black French perpetual outsiders in a society where the overwhelming majority aspires to a colorblind universalism. “They say that there’s something, wherever you are in the world, whatever language you speak, whatever your history, this Black nature endures,” said Ms. de Montaigne, 44, whose parents immigrated from Martinique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. “But that’s exactly how you make it impossible to become a citizen, because there will always be something in me that will never be included in society.” In the United States, many immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean or Asia develop a shared sense of race and grow acutely aware of the role of race in America, a country where it is part of the daily conversation. Rokhaya Diallo, 42, a journalist who is also one of France’s most prominent anti-racism activists, said she became aware of a shared sense of race only after she became an adult and often found herself the only Black person in an academic or professional setting. She grew up in La Courneuve, a suburb of Paris known as a banlieue, in a building with mostly immigrants from France’s former Southeast Asian colonies. Race was never talked about. But fleeting images of Black people on French television struck a chord in Ms. Diallo, whose parents came from Senegal and Gambia. Like many people of her generation, she loved a children’s television series called “Club Dorothée.” But she could never forget an episode — a colonial trope — in which the host, a white woman, is boiled alive in a caldron by three Black men. “I’d talk about it with my brother,’’ Ms. Diallo said. “We weren’t able to put it in words, but I remember how it annoyed us — cannibals, stupid Blacks, things like that.” By contrast, American shows that were broadcast later in France, like “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” or “The Cosby Show,’’ showed Black people who were “comfortable in their skin,” Ms. Diallo said, adding, “The only positive images of Black people that I saw came from the United States.” Thanks to a U.S. government program, Ms. Diallo, who founded an anti-racism organization called Les Indivisibles in 2007, visited the United States in 2010 to learn about “managing ethnic diversity in the U.S.” Ms. Diallo is one of several high-profile individuals who took part in the U.S. program, a fact that has contributed to fears, especially among French conservatives, of an “Americanization’’ of French society.  The U.S. Embassy in Paris began reaching out to ethnic and racial minorities in France after the Sept. 11 attacks as part of a global push to “win hearts and minds.” The embassy organized educational programs on subjects like affirmative action, a taboo concept in France, drawing nonwhite French audiences for the first time, said Randianina Peccoud, who oversaw the outreach programs and retired from the embassy last year. Ms. Peccoud, who is from Madagascar, a former French colony, also identified grass-roots leaders like Ms. Diallo in the banlieues — often eliciting angry reactions from French officials and fueling enduring suspicions. “They were afraid that people in the banlieues would start to be a little aware of their own situation in French society,” Ms. Peccoud said. The visits to the United States, organized around themes like community organizing in Chicago and diversity, also gave participants an introduction to an alternative vision of society. Almamy Kanouté, an actor, activist and leader in the ongoing protests against police violence in France, visited the United States in 2011 to learn about policies toward new immigrants. In Minneapolis, he met a French-speaking man from Laos whose roots were acknowledged despite his becoming an American citizen — in contrast to France’s assimilationist policies. “Here, they want us to melt into a single body and put aside our cultural diversity,” said Mr. Kanouté, 40, whose parents are from Mali and who appeared in “Les Misérables,” the Oscar-nominated film. “With us, that’s not possible. We’re French, but we don’t forget what makes us whole.” For younger Black people in France, their awareness of race partly grew out of the work of the older generation. Binetou Sylla, 31, a co-author of “Le Dérangeur,” a book about race in France, said she vividly remembers buying the first edition of Mr. Ndiaye’s “The Black Condition,” which helped established Black studies in France, and “had devoured” it. Another co-author, Rhoda Tchokokam, 29, grew up in Cameroon before immigrating to France at the age of 17. While her racial awareness emerged in France, it evolved in the United States, where she went to study for two years, watched all of Spike Lee’s movies and discovered the works of Toni Morrison and Black feminists like Angela Davis and Audre Lorde. “When I started meeting Black people in France, I started broadening my outlook a little,” Ms. Tchokokam said. “I still didn’t think of myself as Black because that’s a long process, where today I define myself as Black politically. Back then, I started becoming aware and when I arrived in the United States, it’s in fact there that I was able to put it in words.” Aurélien Breeden and Constant Méheut contributed research.']","With an eye on the United States, children of immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean are bringing race into the public discourse, in a perceived challenge to France’s universalism."
"A Record 5.4 Million Americans Have Lost Health Insurance, Study Finds",2020-07-13,,"['This briefing has ended. Read live coronavirus updates here. The coronavirus pandemic stripped an estimated 5.4 million Americans of their health insurance between February and May, a stretch in which more adults became uninsured because of job losses than have ever lost coverage in a single year, according to a new analysis. As Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports, the study, to be released Tuesday by the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families U.S.A., found that the estimated increase in uninsured laid-off workers over the three-month period was nearly 40 percent higher than the highest previous increase, which occurred during the recession of 2008 and 2009. In that period, 3.9 million adults lost insurance. “We knew these numbers would be big,’’ said Stan Dorn, who directs the group’s National Center for Coverage Innovation and was the author of the study. “This is the worst economic downturn since World War II. It dwarfs the Great Recession. So it’s not surprising that we would also see the worst increase in the uninsured.” The findings are certain to fuel the debate in Congress over the next round of virus relief. The study is a state-by-state examination of the effects of the pandemic on laid-off adults younger than 65, the age at which Americans become eligible for Medicare. It found that nearly half — 46 percent — of the coverage losses from the pandemic came in five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, and North Carolina. In Texas alone, the number of uninsured jumped from about 4.2 million to nearly 4.9 million, the research found, leaving three out of every 10 Texans uninsured. In the 37 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, 23 percent of laid off workers became uninsured. The percentage was nearly double that — 43 percent — in the 13 states that did not expand Medicaid, which include Texas, Florida and North Carolina. The study comes in the thick of the campaign season, when health care — and in particular the Affordable Care Act — is expected to be a major issue. Democrats and their presumptive presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., are seeking to expand the law, former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. But President Trump and Republicans have pressed to repeal it, and the administration has asked the Supreme Court to overturn it.  Definitive data on loss of coverage will not be available until mid- to late-2021, when the federal government publishes health insurance estimates for 2020. “But,” Mr. Dorn said, “policymakers need to know now what the approximate magnitude is of insurance losses to decide what they need to do. So this is our best estimate for what the actual coverage losses have been.” Florida’s governor gave a measured assessment of his state’s battle with the virus on Monday, saying that the case numbers were still high but that there were signs of stabilization. “We have a long road ahead,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Deaths in Florida are trending upward and are at their highest seven-day average level of the pandemic. Florida added more cases on Sunday than any state had recorded — 15,300 — and on Monday it reported more than 12,600 additional cases, its second-highest total recorded for a single day. Even as the governor appeared to be at pains not to sound too upbeat, health experts in the state painted a much more dire picture. Carlos Migoya, the chief executive of Jackson Health Systems, which runs Jackson Memorial, one of the hardest-hit hospitals from the coronavirus, said 200 people were hospitalized three weeks ago. Now, there are more than 400 patients, 100 of them in intensive care. The hospital is facing shortages in medical staff, personal protective gear and the reagents used to test for the virus. Mr. Migoya said that the hospital was now seeing older patients come in. “That means that the younger people have been contaminating the older people,” he said. Despite the surge in cases, Governor DeSantis remains opposed to a statewide mask mandate. “It’s also important to listen and follow the guidance that is put out by local officials,” he said. The state has been trying to bring the positivity rate of people who are tested for the virus below 10 percent. The Florida Department of Health said that as of July 11, the rate statewide was 11.25 percent. But the mayor of Miami, Carlos A. Gimenez, said the rate in Miami-Dade now exceeded 25 percent. “There’s no bogeyman — it’s us,” he said. “Unless we change behavior, we can get all the testing you want, we can get all the contact tracing you want, and it’s not going to make a difference.” As the virus surges in Florida, more big-name Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach to the Republican National Convention, or deciding to skip it altogether. The G.O.P., which moved the convention to Jacksonville from Charlotte, N.C., after balking at health precautions there, now finds itself locked into a state with a far bigger virus problem, and planning an event whose attendance is waning as the pandemic escalates. President Trump, in the meantime, may not get the restriction-free celebration he yearns for after all. The city of Jacksonville is requiring facial coverings in any public space where social distancing is not possible. And in a news release last week, the host committee said every attendee within the convention perimeter “will be tested and temperature checked each day.” Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Francis Rooney of Florida have no plans to attend. Even Marco Rubio, Florida’s senior senator, has not committed to attending. With coronavirus cases surging in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced one of the most sweeping rollbacks of any state’s reopening plans, saying Monday that he would move to close indoor operations statewide for restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, zoos and card rooms. Bars would be forced to close all operations. And the governor said that in at least 30 of the hardest-hit counties, businesses would be forced to close indoor operations for fitness centers, places of worship, noncritical offices, hair salons and barbershops, and malls. Roughly 80 percent of the state’s population lives in the affected counties, he said. California was averaging more than 8,000 new cases a day as of Sunday, more than double what it was a month ago. The state has seen 331,626 cases, the second highest tally in the nation, and more than 7,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database. “We’re going back into modification mode of our original stay at home order,” Mr. Newsom said. “This continues to be a deadly disease.” Mr. Newsom emphasized that state officials have repeatedly said the state’s reopening process would be more akin to a “dimmer switch” than an on or off switch. In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said Monday that she would ban indoor gatherings of more than 10 people for things like birthday parties, potlucks, book clubs and dinner gatherings. She said the new ban would not apply to the operations of businesses or churches “at this time.” Mr. Newsom made the announcement after California’s two largest public school districts said Monday that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that increasing cases in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. The Los Angeles and San Diego unified school districts, which together enroll some 825,000 students, are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. More than a third of California’s cases are in Los Angeles County and San Diego County has had 18 community outbreaks over the past week, more than double the state’s acceptable threshold. The joint announcement came as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to press the Trump administration’s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students’ social and emotional development, but so that parents can return to work fully. At the White House, Mr. Trump denounced the decision in Los Angeles, arguing that schools should resume because children wanted to attend. “Schools should be opened,” Mr. Trump said. “You’re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed.” It was not clear what he meant, since public health experts say the virus spreads quickly in poorly ventilated, closed areas, the condition of many American schools. The recommendations from the president and Ms. DeVos have been disputed by many public health officials and teachers. On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and AASA, the School Superintendents Association, issued a statement saying that reopening recommendations should be “based on evidence, not politics.” The groups added that “we should leave it to health experts to tell us when the time is best to open up school buildings, and listen to educators and administrators to shape how we do it.” In the Los Angeles and San Diego districts’ joint statement, they noted that while much has been learned about the virus, many recommendations and findings are vague and contradictory. But “one fact is clear,” the statement said. “Those countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. California has neither. The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.” The coronavirus struck Oregon early, with cases emerging in February. But unlike two of its neighboring states, Washington and California, Oregon was not quickly overwhelmed by the pandemic. The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, far fewer than most of its neighbors. But as the state reopens after an early lockdown, cases are spiking. The state set a record on Thursday with 389 new infections. If the spread of the virus continues at its current rate, Oregon Health Authority models predict that Portland hospitals will hit capacity in a month, and hospitals throughout the state will be overwhelmed within 90 days. Oregon’s governor says geography helps explain the problem. “We’re sandwiched between California and Washington,” Gov. Kate Brown said. “We’re not an island, and the virus knows absolutely no jurisdictional boundaries.” In rural parts of the state — where the increase has been most drastic — outbreaks have been spurred by large gatherings at churches, food-processing facilities, funerals and graduation parties. Recent gatherings to celebrate the Fourth of July have added to challenge, officials said. “Our biggest concerns are these household and backyard gatherings where people are getting together with a bunch of other households,” said Dr. Paul Cieslak, a state epidemiologist and a senior health adviser for the Oregon Health Authority. As serious as the recent caseload has been, many fear that the upcoming harvest season could make things even worse, as additional agricultural workers pour in and processing plants kick into high gear. U.S. Roundup As Texas faces one of the sharpest increases of new infections in the country, a top medical adviser to Gov. Greg Abbott said the state may need to roll back its reopening and reinstitute an economic lockdown if cases continue to spike. The statements by Dr. Mark McClellan, a physician and an economist at Duke University who is a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, came as more than three dozen states saw increases in infections after loosening health and safety restrictions in order to restart their economies. When Texas started reopening on May 1, more than 29,000 Texans had been infected and more than 800 had died. Two months later, on Monday, there have been more than 265,000 infections and more than 3,200 deaths. Dr. McClellan said in an interview that a lockdown in Texas was a “real possibility” that Governor Abbott may be forced to impose in the next few weeks. “I don’t think we have much time, before having to go to a more extreme step,” Dr. McClellan said. Sylvester Turner, the mayor of Houston, said on Monday he asked the governor to impose a shutdown for a “minimum of two weeks” to prevent the further spread of the disease. “If we can not have a shut down, then at least step back to state’s Phase I,” Mayor Turner wrote on Twitter. The rapid spread has already forced the governor to reverse course by temporarily pausing the reopening, closing bars again and issuing a mask order for most Texans. The governor has suggested in recent television interviews that putting the state back under a lockdown was an option. For most of April, a statewide stay-at-home order slowed the Texas economy, closing many businesses while helping to keep the number of cases relatively low compared to other states. But since the governor decided to reopen restaurants and other businesses in phases in May, Texas has become one of the nation’s coronavirus hot spots. “The virus is out there in our communities all over Texas,” said Dr. McClellan, one of four public-health experts advising the governor during the pandemic. “Maybe there are a few small exceptions, but not really anymore.” Here’s what else is happening around the U.S.: Los Angeles Apparel, which was one of the first clothing retailers to help produce much-needed masks when they were in short supply, was ordered closed on July 10 by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health after more than 300 confirmed infections and four deaths among its garment workers. KFC, the fried chicken chain, closed dining rooms in all 40 of its corporate-owned restaurants in Florida on Monday as virus cases in the state continued to skyrocket. The company encouraged franchisees operating stores in Florida and other virus “hot spot states” such as Arizona, California and Texas to follow suit.  Tennessee recorded more than 2,500 new cases Monday for a single-day record. In Washington State, more than 1,080 cases were announced, also a record. Kansas officials announced more than 880 new cases on Monday, the highest single-day total in that state. Because Kansas’s health department updates statewide only data three times weekly, the most infrequent reporting schedule in the country, its daily totals vary widely. The United States health departments track the virus’s spread with a distinctly American patchwork: a reporting system in which some test results arrive via smooth data feeds but others come by phone, email, physical mail or even fax machines. Wall Street was turbulent, with stocks reversing an early gain that had briefly lifted the S&P 500 back into positive territory for the year. The index was nearly 1 percent lower by the end of the day, after earlier having climbed more than 1.5 percent. The unsteady trading came as the number of virus cases continued to rise, and California moved to close more businesses. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Monday, seeking to block a new rule that would revoke the visas of foreign students who take classes entirely online in the fall. The rule, issued a week ago, would upend months of careful planning by colleges and universities, the lawsuit says, and could force many students to return to their home countries during the pandemic, where their ability to study would be severely compromised. “The Trump administration didn’t even attempt to explain the basis for this senseless rule, which forces schools to choose between keeping their international students enrolled and protecting the health and safety of their campuses,” Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement announcing the suit, which accuses the administration of violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The action, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, is the latest legal effort to contest the federal edict, which has been described by states and universities in court filings as a politically motivated attempt by the Trump administration to force universities to hold in-person classes this fall, even as many have announced they will remain largely online because of health concerns. California filed its own lawsuit last week, after Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had already gone to court seeking to block the new rule. Arguments in the Harvard and M.I.T. case are scheduled to be heard on Tuesday, also in the district court in Boston. The federal guidance issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which says foreign students earning their degrees entirely online cannot stay in the United States, has sent students scrambling to enroll in in-person classes that are difficult to find. Many universities are planning to offer a mix of online and in-person classes to protect the health of faculty, students and their surrounding communities during the pandemic. The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, defended the administration’s actions at a news conference early last week. “You don’t get a visa for taking online classes from, let’s say, University of Phoenix. So why would you if you were just taking online classes, generally?” she told reporters, adding, “Perhaps the better lawsuit would be coming from students who have to pay full tuition with no access to in-person classes to attend.” The area represented by the 17 states and the District of Columbia contains 1,124 colleges and universities that had a combined 373,000 international students enrolled in 2019, who contributed an estimated $14 billion to the economy that year, according to the complaint. About 40 higher education institutions filed declarations in support of the lawsuit, including Yale, DePaul, the University of Chicago, Tufts, Rutgers and state universities in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, was back at the White House on Monday meeting with Mark Meadows, the chief of staff — but not Mr. Trump — after a weekend in which some of the president’s advisers undercut him in the press. Dr. Fauci — who has not had direct contact with the president in more than five weeks even as the number of Americans with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has risen sharply in the Southwest — slipped back into the West Wing to meet with Mr. Meadows, while his allies denounced what they called a meanspirited and misguided effort by the White House to smear him. White House officials declined to comment on what was discussed in the conversation between Mr. Meadows, who has long expressed skepticism about the conclusions of the nation’s public health experts, and Dr. Fauci, though one official called it a good conversation and said they continued to have a positive relationship. Mr. Trump made no effort to sugarcoat his rift with Dr. Fauci, declining to repudiate the criticism of him from his staff and saying that “I don’t always agree with him.” But the president also implicitly acknowledged how unlikely he was to get rid of Dr. Fauci, calling him “a very nice person” and saying that “I like him personally.” Dr. Fauci, for his part, continued to issue warnings about the virus. “We haven’t even begun to see the end of it yet,” he said in an interview Monday with Lloyd B. Minor, the dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine. He noted that the nation had “plateaued at a level that was really quite high, about 20,000 infections a day” when many states began to ease restrictions. “Then, as we started to reopen, we’re seeing the surges that we’re seeing today, as we speak,” he said. Dr. Fauci spent the early days of the pandemic as the leading scientific voice in the federal government’s response before falling out of favor with Mr. Trump and his top aides over blunt comments inconsistent with the president’s message of economic resurgence. In task force meetings, Dr. Fauci has often styled himself as a solitary pessimist in a room where some officials have been eager to wave away the alarming trajectory of the coronavirus. He has grown increasingly vocal in his concerns about the national surge in cases and offered a far darker perspective on the virus than the one the president routinely gives. Over the weekend, aides to Mr. Trump released to The Washington Post and other news outlets a list of remarks Dr. Fauci made about the virus when it was in its early stages. It featured several comments White House aides had privately complained about for months. A poll conducted for The New York Times by Siena College last month showed that 67 percent of Americans trusted Dr. Fauci when it came to the virus; only 26 percent trusted the president. He had a coffee cup in one hand, a smart phone in the other, and a pair of glasses resting on his stomach. What wasn’t seen in the picture of Ted Cruz, Senator of Texas, that circulated widely on social media in recent days, was his face mask. The picture of Senator Cruz sitting in an airplane seat, was posted on Twitter on Sunday night by an employee of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Another photo shows Mr. Cruz, a Republican from Texas, sitting outside the flight’s gate, also without a mask. Another photo shared on a different Twitter account on Monday appears to show Mr. Cruz wearing a red, black and white mask on a flight. A spokesperson for American Airlines confirmed that Mr. Cruz had flown with one of its domestic regional partners on Sunday and said that the company had reviewed the incident. “As we do in all instances like these, we reviewed the details of the matter,” the spokesperson wrote in an email on Monday afternoon. “And while our policy does not apply while eating or drinking, we have reached out to Senator Cruz to affirm the importance of this policy as part of our commitment to protecting the health and safety of the traveling public.” American Airlines announced in mid-June that it would require passengers to wear face coverings while on board its planes and that it would deny boarding to passengers who refused to comply. The policy allows face coverings to be removed while eating or drinking. A representative from Mr. Cruz’s office said that the senator wore a face covering when traveling and that he had temporarily removed his mask to eat or drink when he was photographed without one. “Senator Cruz has repeatedly said since the start of the pandemic we need to follow the science, listen to public health experts and take common sense steps to slow the spread of Covid-19 and reopen our economy,” the spokeswoman said in an email. “That includes wearing face masks, washing hands and social distancing where possible.” Hosseh Enad, who shared the photos of Mr. Cruz without a mask, later wrote that the photos were taken by a mutual friend. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Hong Kong, a city that weeks ago seemed like one of the most successful places in controlling the virus, announced Monday evening that it would close gyms and cinemas and ban public gatherings of more than four people in response to a new wave of locally transmitted infections. Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive, announced a series of measures to take effect on Wednesday. Also included were a prohibition on all dining inside restaurants every evening from 6 p.m., and a requirement that everyone taking public transportation wear a mask. The Walt Disney Company said on Monday that Hong Kong Disneyland would also close again to comply with the new government order. Health officials said that the territory’s new spate of cases, including another 52 announced on Monday, was mainly connected to taxi drivers, restaurants and nursing homes. The prohibition on public gatherings of four or more people could make it even harder for the pro-democracy opposition to organize any protests against a stringent national security law imposed on June 30 by Beijing. The ban could also interfere with an election campaign now underway to choose a new legislature on Sept. 6. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, has a robust contact-tracing system that helped the authorities contain an initial outbreak last winter. The city won praise from international health experts in the pandemic’s early days. In response to a second wave of infections imported in March from Europe and the United States, Hong Kong closed its borders to nonresidents and mandated quarantine for returning residents. Under the new regulations issued on Monday, travelers to Hong Kong will be required to provide proof that they tested negative before boarding flights to the city. The 52 new cases on Monday continued a weeklong spike, labeled a third wave by health officials, after months in which few or no new daily infections were detected. The authorities said they were unable to trace the infection pattern in 20 of the new cases disclosed on Monday. That raises the prospect that the virus is circulating silently in the community, after months in which local transmission appeared to have been at a standstill. New York ROUNDUP New York is tightening its restrictions on travelers from designated states with high infection rates. Those travelers, who were already required to quarantine for 14 days, must now provide contact information and details on their planned whereabouts to local authorities upon their arrival at airports across the state starting Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday. The stepped-up enforcement measures are being done in an attempt to keep the outbreaks raging in other states from seeding new infections in New York. The quarantine requirement in New York applies to travelers arriving from 19 states, including Florida, Texas and California. Almost 40 states are seeing cases rise across the country. Mr. Cuomo, who announced the new rule at a briefing Monday, said that forms to collect information from travelers would be distributed on airplanes and could also be filled out electronically. If travelers do not fill them out before leaving the airport, they can be given a summons and fined up to $2,000, he said. They can also be taken before a hearing and ordered to complete the quarantine. At airports run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, teams made up of agency police officers and state employees will meet disembarking passengers at gates to confirm that passengers completed the state Health Department form. Regional airports will handle enforcement at gates at their facilities, too. He added that all travelers from designated states who arrive by other forms of transportation, including cars and trains, must also fill out the form online. Mr. Cuomo said a recent outbreak in Rensselaer County originated with three residents who traveled to Georgia and back and who did not report their arrival in New York. Two of those people worked in nursing homes, he said. “We can’t be in a situation where people are coming from other states in the country and bringing the virus again,” he said. Elsewhere in New York: New York will use a formula to determine whether schools in different regions of the state can open come September, the governor said Monday. Schools will be allowed to reopen if a region of the state has a daily infection rate below 5 percent over a two-week average, and if that region has reached the least restrictive reopening phase. Schools will not reopen, or will be closed, if a region has an infection rate over 9 percent over a one-week average. The state would make a decision about whether schools can reopen during the first week of August. New York City’s mayor has already announced that city schools will reopen in September using staggered schedules. If the governor determines in August that is not yet safe to reopen, that plan will not go into effect. On Monday, the state Education Department released broad guidelines for how schools should reopen safely. New York City’s mayor said on Monday that the infection rate was rising for younger adults, especially those between 20 and 29 years of age. Across the country, younger people have been driving surges in new cases in recent weeks, prompting alarmed public officials to call for masks and social distancing. “We see a problem and we need to address it,” the mayor said, adding that the city would ramp up its outreach to young adults. GLOBAL ROUNDUP Mexico surpassed Italy in virus deaths on Sunday, becoming the country with the fourth-highest number of fatalities from the virus after the United States, Brazil and the United Kingdom. More than 35,000 Mexicans have died in the pandemic, and the country has nearly 300,000 confirmed cases, according to a Times database. And the death toll in Latin America’s second-most-populous nation is probably much worse than official statistics suggest. The bleak milestone underscored government missteps in containing a pandemic that has overwhelmed hospitals, with basic supplies running low and medical professionals falling ill at alarming rates. Just a few months ago, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was gathering crowds of supporters, kissing babies and urging people to hug each other because “nothing’s going to happen.” The country was slow to impose social-distancing measures and temporarily close businesses, and the government has repeatedly changed its projection of when the virus might peak. It now says infections will continue at least through the fall. Despite this, many parts of the country have moved forward with plans to reopen businesses, including factories, restaurants and hotels. Hugo López-Gatell, the health official who has become the public face of the country’s response to the pandemic, said last week that “the epidemic is decelerating.” He said that new cases have been growing at a slower rate and that the return to public life across the country has not resulted in an uptick in outbreaks. In other developments around the world: The World Health Organization admonished governments on Monday that it said are sending mixed messages to citizens, and for failing to invest in the hard work necessary to combat the pandemic. “Let me be blunt,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization’s director general. “Too many countries are headed in the wrong direction. The virus remains public enemy No. 1, but the actions of many governments and people don’t reflect this.” He added, “Mixed messages from leaders are undermining the most critical ingredient of any response: trust.” Amnesty International has called for an inquiry into the British government after Britain recorded one of the largest numbers of coronavirus-related deaths among health care workers, according to a report published by the organization on Monday. More than 3,000 health workers around the world have died after contracting the virus, Amnesty International said. Of those, 540 have been in Britain, which was second only to Russia, where 545 health workers have died. The figure is 507 in the United States. Australian citizens and residents returning from overseas to New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, will be charged for their mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine starting Saturday, the state premier said. Mandatory hotel quarantines at a similar cost are already in effect in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and other parts of the country are likely to begin charging travelers as well amid a new outbreak in Melbourne, Australia’s second-biggest city. The border has been closed to nonresidents since March. The leader of Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia, Quim Torra, said on Monday that his government would proceed with a regional lockdown, a day after a judge ruled that such a measure was only valid if approved by the country’s central government. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa reinstated a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in an effort to alleviate pressure on the health care system. The government also reintroduced an overnight curfew. South Africa has seen a surge in cases as the country enters its coldest month, with more than 264,000 known cases, and nearly 4,000 deaths, according to a New York Times database. Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing who had criticized the Chinese government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, was released from detention on Sunday, a week after the police took him away. On Monday, an organization in France comprising doctors and virus victims has appealed to the country’s highest administrative court to impose the wearing of masks, adding that it was “urgent to take all possible measures to prevent the second wave” of infections. Prime Minister Jean Castex said that he was considering the compulsory wearing of masks to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic and called on people to stay vigilant.

Statue of Black Protester Is Raised in Place of Bristol Slave Trader,2020-07-15,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Jen Reid had never marched in a Black Lives Matter protest before she took to the streets of Bristol, England, on June 7. By the end of that angry day, she had clambered up to stand in the place of a 17th-century slave trader, whose bronze statue had been pulled down and dumped in the city’s harbor. The image of Ms. Reid, her fist clenched, her right arm thrust upward in a gesture of defiance, spread widely on social media. For many, it seemed the perfect replacement for the notorious merchant, Edward Colston — a flesh-and-blood rebuke to the trader’s cruel legacy, which still hangs over modern Bristol. At dawn on Wednesday morning, Ms. Reid was up there again in the form of a resin-and-steel sculpture by Marc Quinn. A prominent British sculptor known for his provocative works, Mr. Quinn said that when he saw the image of Ms. Reid on the plinth, he sensed the opportunity for an act of guerrilla art. He got in touch with Ms. Reid and proposed a clandestine project, in which she would pose for a sculpture that he would install where the Colston statue had stood. Working with a team of 10 people, Mr. Quinn swiftly erected the piece without the approval of city authorities. How long it will be allowed to stay there was not clear. “She created this iconic image,” Mr. Quinn said in an interview. “I’m just amplifying the moment she created.” He said he viewed the sculpture as a complement to the protests, one that he hoped would provoke debate about “how we commemorate people in statues.” While he said he did not expect city officials to leave the work in place permanently, he hoped they would leave it long enough to prompt a conversation. Ms. Reid, who works as a fashion stylist, said she found it “surreal” to have an artist memorialize her spontaneous decision to climb up on the plinth, a moment she recalls with a mix of exhilaration and fear, given her worries about falling off. “Looking back on that moment, it just gives me goose-pimples,” she said. “Marc has just captured all of it in the statue.” Even before that moment, Ms. Reid said she had misgivings about going to the march. She is taking care of aging parents and was worried about the risk of contracting the coronavirus in the crowds. But her outrage at the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis overrode her trepidation, she said, and she decided to go, even buying a black beret and glove for the occasion. Ms. Reid and her husband, Alasdair Doggart, listened to speeches before joining a march to the site of the Colston statue. After they watched the crowd tear it down and dump it in the water, the couple returned to the empty plinth, where — helped up by Mr. Doggart — she stood on the plinth and struck her pose. “It wasn’t as easy as it looked because it was a lot higher than I thought it was,” Ms. Reid said. “My legs were jelly. It was a slow rise, but when I stood up and raised my fist, the crowd cheered like crazy.” Mr. Doggart snapped a photo, which he posted on his Instagram account. The next morning, after a colleague of Mr. Quinn’s showed it to him, he called Ms. Reid and proposed the project. She traveled to a film production studio outside London and recreated the pose for Mr. Quinn, who arrayed 200 cameras to shoot her from every angle. After he made a three-dimensional scan, Mr. Quinn created the sculpture from resin. Working in bronze, he said, would have added several months to the project, and he wanted to install the piece while memories of that day were fresh. Mr. Quinn is part of a cohort of British visual artists, known as Young British Artists, or Y.B.A.s, who came to prominence in the 1980s. The group, which includes Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, is known for the shock value of their works, like Mr. Hirst’s display of a shark preserved in formaldehyde. Mr. Quinn’s best known work is a cast of his head, made from his own frozen blood. He also drew attention for a marble sculpture, “Alison Lapper Pregnant,” which depicted a woman with a condition that left her with no arms and shortened legs. It was placed on a plinth in Trafalgar Square in London from 2005 to 2007. “I’m interested in how society is moving, and bringing it into the world of art, which is kind of antiseptic,” Mr. Quinn said. “It’s because I’m a successful artist, I can get this up. It’s a temporary sentence in the conversation.” The debate over what should permanently replace the Colston statue has percolated since last month. Historians have suggested a statue of Paul Stephenson, a Black activist who organized a successful boycott of a Bristol bus company in the 1960s. A mannequin of Jimmy Savile, the disgraced BBC television host — dressed in a blonde wig and neon tracksuit — was placed on the plinth for a few days. As for the statue of Colston, Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, ordered it fished out of the harbor and stored for safekeeping while the public debates what to do with it. It is likely to end up in a local museum that has an exhibit about Bristol’s links to the slave trade. Mr. Rees has gotten plenty of other suggestions already. Banksy, the elusive street artist who became famous for his graffiti paintings on the sides of buildings in Bristol, posted a sketch on Instagram of a proposed memorial depicting Colston in the act of being toppled, with protesters tugging on ropes around his neck. For Ms. Reid, a descendant of Jamaican immigrants, the debate over the statue symbolized Bristol’s reluctance to confront the sinister past of one of its biggest benefactors. Colston’s name is still on a school, a performing arts center and several other institutions in the city, though some are in the process of removing it. “I walked past his statue every day for the last five years,” she said. “It’s an effrontery to have a slave master you have to walk past everyday.” Ms. Reid said she had no idea whether the city would let the statue of her stay in place for several months — or a single day. But she confessed to being tickled about being a part of Bristol’s urban landscape in a time of social change. “I’ll tell people to meet me by my statue,” she said laughing.']","The image of Jen Reid, fist clenched atop the plinth in the English city where Edward Colston once stood, became a symbol of protest online. Now, it’s there in resin and steel."
"As U.S. Coronavirus Cases Hit 3.5 Million, Officials Scramble to Add Restrictions",2020-07-15,,"['Follow our live updates of coronavirus cases and deaths globally. The United States on Wednesday reported more than 67,300 new infections across the country, according to a New York Times database. It was the nation’s second-highest single-day total and roughly 1,000 cases shy of the record set last week. The U.S. outbreak, which has increased in 41 states over the past two weeks, hit 3.5 million total infections on Wednesday, the Times’s database shows. Alabama and Idaho set single-day death records, and officials in Arizona announced 101 deaths, tying that state’s daily record. In a cautionary effort, several large school districts said on Wednesday that they would open the year with online classes, bucking pressure from President Trump and his administration to get students back into classrooms as quickly as possible. The Houston Independent School District, the seventh-largest in the country, said it would start the year virtually on Sept. 8. Students will have at least six weeks of online instruction, with a tentative plan to start in-person classes on Oct. 19. In San Francisco, school officials announced that the upcoming school year would start with distance learning and that the district would “gradually phase in a staggered return” to the classroom. In a message to parents, the superintendent,  Vincent Matthews, wrote that “we hope to provide a gradual hybrid approach (a combination of in-person and distance learning) for some students when science and data suggest it is safe to do so.” Officials in Prince George’s County, Md., announced that students would be distance-learning through at least February. The announcements came a week after Mr. Trump threatened to cut federal funding for school systems that defied his demand to reopen classrooms, and after he pressured the government’s top public health experts to water down recommendations for how schools could reopen safely. Los Angeles and San Diego, the two largest public school districts in California, announced this week that instruction would be online only in the fall. Now, 11 of the 15 largest districts in California have said that they will reopen with 100 percent remote instruction. New York City, which has the largest school district in the nation, is planning a mix of in-person and remote learning, with students expected to return to classrooms from one to three days a week. Some governors and school districts are pressing ahead with plans to reopen classrooms, however. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, is urging school districts to give parents the option of sending their children to school five days a week. In Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, announced that she would delay the opening of schools by several weeks, until after Labor Day, saying that schools needed time to get masks, thermometers, hand sanitizer and other supplies. “I can’t in good conscience open schools when Kansas has numerous hot spots where cases are at an all-time high & continuing to rapidly rise,” she wrote on Twitter. As the U.S. outbreak increased in 41 states over the past two weeks and reached 3.5 million total infections on Wednesday, according to a New York Times database, governors and mayors across the nation have scrambled to respond, issuing new mask orders, limiting the size of gatherings and preparing for things to get much worse in the coming weeks. But in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, on Wednesday specifically forbade local officials to require people to wear face coverings in public even as he extended his executive order limiting the size of public gatherings to 50. The order, which was set to expire at midnight, will now last until July 31. It says people are “strongly encouraged” to wear face coverings outside their homes. According to The Associated Press, the ban on local face-mask requirements would affect orders by at least 15 local governments in the state. The state’s seven-day average of new cases jumped to nearly 3,000 on Tuesday from 1,900 on July 1. Hospitalizations in the state have also been rising, and the governor said last week that a shuttered temporary hospital at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta would be reopened. In Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, on Wednesday issued an order requiring people to wear masks in public. The state on Wednesday reported 47 deaths, its record for a single day. In Montana, Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, said that he was also issuing a mask order. The private sector took steps as well: Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said it would require all customers to wear masks, beginning on Monday. The grocery chain Kroger also said its customers had to to wear masks starting July 22. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, warned of “an unsettling climb” in new cases and moved to reduce seating capacity in restaurants and to limit the size of gatherings. And in Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, said that she was willing to reverse course and tighten restrictions again. “I won’t just turn the car around,” she said. “I’m going to shut it off, I’m going to kick you out and I’m going to make you walk home.” Oklahoma hit a single-day record for cases on Wednesday, with 1,075, and the state’s governor, Kevin Stitt, announced that he had tested positive, becoming the first governor known to be infected with the coronavirus. Mr. Stitt, a Republican, has attended many public events and has often been photographed in public while not wearing a mask, including at an indoor rally for President Trump that was held in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20. He said that he did not know where, when or how he had contracted the virus, and that his infection had not prompted him to second-guess his response to the outbreak. On Wednesday, Florida became the third state — after New York and California — to surpass 300,000 total cases. Its governor, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, says the state will deploy 1,000 medical workers to hospitals that have beds for coronavirus patients but not enough doctors and nurses to treat them.  Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, gave an evening address on the virus in which he warned Ohioans that if they did not act to curb the recent uptick in cases, “Florida and Arizona will be our future.” “Now let’s be honest, all of us — all of us — have started to let our guard down,” he said. “I know I have. We’re tired. We want to go back to the way things were, and that’s very, very understandable. But when we do, we’re literally playing a Russian roulette game with our own lives, and our families’, and our neighbors.’” China’s economy expanded 3.2 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year, officials said on Thursday. The recovery is a sign, with caveats, of the authoritarian government’s success in bringing the outbreak under control with widespread testing and travel restrictions. By contrast, economies in Europe and the United States are still languishing as the pandemic forces cities to shut down and shoppers to stay home. China’s growth from April through June is an abrupt turnaround from first quarter, when its economy shrank 6.8 percent, the first contraction that the government has acknowledged in nearly half a century. The new figures partly reflect the restrictions that China imposed after its early missteps delayed the response to the outbreak and fed public anger, as well as the government’s continued reliance on infrastructure spending instead of domestic consumption. But all the recent spending on highways and rail lines raises questions about whether China’s economic turnaround is sustainable and whether it can become the engine needed to drive the global economy out of a slump. Factories in China are already cranking out furniture, consumer electronics and mass-market cars more quickly than consumers at home or abroad want to buy them. “It looks like there is still a mismatch there — people are not consuming as much as previously,” said Sara Hsu, a visiting scholar in economics at Fudan University in Shanghai. Sales of groceries and other essentials have stayed strong in China throughout the pandemic, but people’s willingness to spend money on restaurant meals and other nonessential goods and services has still not fully bounced back. Tens of millions of Chinese, particularly young people, also remain out of work, and the slowdown caused by the pandemic has widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Asian stocks were down on Thursday after China released its economic data. Chinese equities fell about 1.5 percept, and markets slipped in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. The official China Film Administration also said in a notice on Thursday that movie theaters in the Chinese mainland would gradually reopen starting next Monday. Bookings will be limited, and theaters will be regularly disinfected, the notice said. As Trump administration officials have increasingly sought to undermine him in recent days, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and one of the most trusted federal officials working on the pandemic, made his most pointed remarks yet on Wednesday addressing tensions with the White House. “I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,” Dr. Fauci said in an interview with The Atlantic on Wednesday. “I think they realize now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it’s only reflecting negatively on them.” He spoke as Trump administration officials have sought to undermine his credibility — first anonymously, over the weekend, and then out in the open. A short op-ed by Peter Navarro, the president’s top trade adviser, published in USA Today on Tuesday evening was headlined “Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.” Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff for communications, posted a cartoon Sunday evening mocking Dr. Fauci. In the interview Wednesday, Dr. Fauci called the partisan environment around the virus disturbing. “It distracts from what I hope would be the common effort of getting this thing under control, rather than this back-and-forth distraction, which just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. Asked to review the government’s response to the pandemic, he said: “We’ve got to almost reset this and say, OK, let’s stop this nonsense and figure out how can we get our control over this now, and looking forward, how can we make sure that next month, we don’t have another example of California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, because those are the hot zones now, and I’m looking at the map, saying we got to make sure it doesn’t happen in other states.” “So rather than these games people are playing,” he said, “let’s focus on that.” Mr. Trump put some distance between himself and his aide’s op-ed piece, saying, “I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.” Others in the administration went further than the president. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters Wednesday that the administration “couldn’t be more grateful” for Dr. Fauci’s “steady counsel.” Alyssa Farah, the White House director for strategic communications, wrote on Twitter. ““The Peter Navarro op-ed didn’t go through normal White House clearance processes and is the opinion of Peter alone.” Drug deaths in the United States, which in 2018 fell for the first time in 25 years, rose to record numbers in 2019 and are continuing to climb, a resurgence that appears related to some of the hardships created by the coronavirus outbreak. Drug deaths have risen an average of 13 percent so far in 2020 compared with last year, according to mortality data collected by The New York Times. If this trend continues for the rest of the year, the increase in annual drug deaths will be the sharpest since 2016. Several public health experts said conditions created by the pandemic could hurt the nation’s fragile progress in fighting drug-related deaths, but they noted that the overdose rate was on its way back up well before the virus arrived. “Covid just makes it a bit worse,” said Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Researchers say the threat of overdose can be exacerbated by the social-isolation practices used to contain the virus. Aside from the emotional effects, there are practical dangers: Using drugs alone means there is no one around if a revival attempt is needed. The vast curtailment of in-person medical treatment — including group counseling sessions and stays at residential treatment centers — means there is far less of the emotional support that can be vital to addiction treatment. Global Roundup Women of color have long faced economic and racial inequality in Britain. Now that group is being hit disproportionately by the financial and psychological impact of the pandemic, according to a recent study by a group of British universities and women’s charities. The survey found that nearly 43 percent of Black and ethnic minority women believed that they would be in more debt than before the pandemic, compared with 37 percent of white women and 34 percent of white men. More than four in 10 of the women said they would struggle to make ends meet over the next three months. A government review of the disparities in the risk and outcomes from the coronavirus found that death rates have been higher in Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups than in white groups. The review found that Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and other Asians, as well as Caribbeans and other Black people, had from 10 percent to 50 percent higher risk of death than white Britons. In a recent study, Runnymede Trust, a think tank, found women of color were burdened with carrying out menial tasks that can be perilous in a pandemic. “Covid-19 has brought the harsh realities of pre-existing racial inequalities into sharp relief, and nowhere is this more manifest than the disproportionate social and economic impact of Covid-19 on Black and ethnic minority women,” said Zubaida Haque, the interim director of Runnymede. In other news from around the world: India reported 32,695 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, its highest single-day caseload yet. Several Indian states are reintroducing social distancing measures that they lifted in June, and the country’s total caseload — the world’s third-largest, after the United States and Brazil — is nearing one million. Tokyo was expected to report a single-day record of more than 280 new cases on Thursday, Japan’s national broadcaster reported. The authorities in the Philippines have empowered the police to fan out home-to-home in search of infected people, triggering an uproar among human rights groups. Childhood vaccination rates have plunged during the pandemic, and the World Health Organization warned that the long-term effects from missed inoculations could be worse than Covid-19. Black business owners are more likely to be hindered in seeking coronavirus financial aid than their white peers, a new study has found. The study looked at how more than a dozen Washington-area banks handled requests for loans under the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. It was conducted by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit in Washington, in partnership with researchers from universities in Utah and New Jersey. From late April to late May, the researchers and the nonprofit, which supports better access to capital for low-income and minority communities, sent pairs of would-be loan applicants to branches of 17 banks. In each pair, a Black borrower and a white borrower shared similar credit and asset characteristics, so the only difference between them was their race. To make the study more conservative, the researchers gave each Black borrower a slightly better financial profile than his or her white counterpart. The Black borrowers were offered different products and treated significantly worse by employees than white borrowers were in 43 percent of the tests, the study found. Of the 17 banks, some of which were tested through multiple branches, 13 had at least one test in which a white borrower was treated better than his or her Black counterpart. In the rest of the tests, the pairs were treated relatively equally or the difference wasn’t significant enough to count as a violation of fair lending laws, in the researchers’ view. Myanmar will soon adopt rules that would permit captive breeding of about 175 threatened species, including tigers, pangolins and Irrawaddy dolphins, despite fears that such ventures could encourage the poaching of wild animals and spawn new diseases that jump to humans. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation quietly circulated a list of wildlife last month that could be raised commercially for display in zoos, tourist attractions or hotels and, in a handful of cases, to produce meat for sale to the public. Officials say the list is aimed at improving wildlife protection by reducing illegal hunting and increasing conservation under an existing law. But international conservation groups said the plan could undermine wildlife protection by increasing demand for wild meat and for species used in traditional medicine. Keeping wildlife for human consumption, especially in crowded Asian markets, has been linked to viruses that have infected humans, including the coronavirus that has caused the current pandemic and the one that caused SARS, which emerged in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide. “Commercial wildlife breeding and trade can also increase the risk of disease spillover from wildlife to humans, such as Covid-19,” the World Wildlife Fund and Fauna and Flora International said. The pangolin, which at one point was suspected of playing a part in the transmission of the new coronavirus, could be bred in Myanmar zoos under the new regulations. It is far from certain that pangolins were involved in the emergence of the new coronavirus. Pangolins do host similar viruses, but a virus found in intermediate horseshoe bats is closer to the one that causes Covid-19. In addition, none of the viruses carried by pangolins are similar enough to the new coronavirus to indicate a direct spillover to humans, and there has been no clear transmission path established from bats to pangolins. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert H. Redfield, defended the Trump administration’s decision to strip the C.D.C. of control of some of the nation’s key coronavirus data, saying on Wednesday that the move was necessary to modernize data collection. On a conference call with reporters, Dr. Redfield said the C.D.C. was looking for ways to make its coronavirus data more “externally facing,” so that Americans could examine “the current extent of the pandemic in different counties and in different ZIP codes.” The administration’s new directive instructs hospitals to report coronavirus information directly to a new central database at the Department of Human Health and Services in Washington, rather than to the C.D.C. in Atlanta, which has been collecting the information since the start of the pandemic and which prides itself on scientific independence. The directive to bypass the C.D.C. has provoked an uproar among public health experts. Researchers, state health officials and academics rely on the C.D.C.’s data, and expressed concern about whether Health and Human Services, the parent agency of the C.D.C., would be as transparent as the C.D.C. has been. The new database, called H.H.S. Protect, is not public. Experts including Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida and a former health secretary, accused the administration of trying to politicize the data by taking control of it away from the C.D.C. Jose Arrietta, the chief information officer for Health and Human Services, said on Wednesday that the new database would feed information to the C.D.C., which would continue to issue reports on the pandemic. Mr. Arrieta said the health agency is considering giving members of Congress access to the new database, and is “exploring the best way” to make information from it available to news organizations, academic researchers and the general public. Temperatures have been soaring across the South and the Southwest, reaching record highs in areas grappling with some of the worst virus outbreaks in the nation — making it more difficult to protect people who are at risk from extreme heat. San Antonio hit 106 degrees on Monday, tying the July record. Monitors at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport hit a blazing 114, matching the old record. Austin hit a high of 108 degrees — three degrees above the old record. Such heat can disproportionally affect the vulnerable: people without the means to buy an air-conditioner or crank it up to full blast. Cities typically open cooling centers, in places like community recreation centers, where people can escape the heat. But the virus has introduced complications in a moment when people are being discouraged from congregating indoors. Austin’s cooling centers now require visitors to maintain social distancing and to wear masks, said Matthew Lara, a spokesman for the city’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. “You don’t want to cram 30 people into a room and call it a cooling center,” he said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service said that the most punishing heat would begin to abate across the South, but, like a hot bubble under the nation’s wallpaper, “will be on the increase for the eastern U.S. and for the northern High Plains.” A pair of recent studies found that people with Type A blood are no more at risk of getting the virus or falling dangerously ill than others, contradicting preliminary evidence based on a relatively small sample of people. Over the past few months, after looking at thousands of additional patients with Covid-19, scientists are reporting a much weaker link to blood type. Two studies — one at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the other at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York — did not find that Type A blood increases the odds that people will be infected. The new reports do find evidence that people with Type O blood may be slightly less likely to be infected. But the effect is so small that people shouldn’t count on it. “No one should think they’re protected,” said Nicholas Tatonetti, a data scientist at Columbia University. Even if blood types don’t matter much for treating people with Covid-19, they could reveal something important about the basic nature of the disease. That’s because blood type influences how your immune system fights against infections. People with Type A blood do not make the same kind of antibodies as people with Type B blood, for example. It is conceivable that these molecular differences in the immune system explain the purported link between blood type and coronavirus infections. Pressure is mounting to close Grand Canyon and other national parks in states across the South and the West that are seeing rising cases. When the pandemic took hold in the United States this spring, many local public health officials demanded that national parks close, arguing that the millions of tourists they attract endangered vulnerable people in adjacent towns and tribal lands, often-remote places with hospitals miles away. After shutting down on April 1, Grand Canyon partially reopened in time for summer tourist season. In some ways, the parks provide a refuge from the pandemic. Experts say the risk of catching the virus is much lower outdoors. Camping offers a cheap, socially distanced vacation for families, and some parks are in sparsely populated areas with fewer cases. But as the virus infiltrates growing sections of the country, some lawmakers are questioning the decision to keep parks open even partially. The government in the Philippines has empowered the police to fan out home-to-home in search of infected people. The move has triggered an uproar among human rights groups, which on Wednesday accused President Rodrigo Duterte’s government of employing repressive tactics. As the number of infected nears 60,000 nationwide, with the death toll surpassing 1,600, health authorities are under tremendous pressure from a public increasingly wary of Mr. Duterte, whose brutal anti-drugs campaign has left thousands dead. The policing plan, termed “Care Strategy,” lets officers accompany health workers in search of infected people who may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. The government said anyone who could not satisfy the requirements for home quarantine — including having their own bathroom and not living with elderly or pregnant people — are to be taken to a private facility. “This move reveals the Duterte government’s continuing reliance on police and militaristic approaches to solve a public health emergency,” said Ephraim Cortez, the secretary general of the National Union of People’s Lawyers, a group that provides counsel to the poor. A well-known Filipino human rights lawyer, Chel Diokno, said the government strategy would sow further terror. “Those with Covid are not police targets, they are medical patients,” Mr. Diokno said. “They should be treated with dignity and care.” Frustration over the lockdown exploded into violence in April, when frustrated and hungry people in an impoverished area of northern Manila took to the streets for an impromptu rally demanding government help. Riot police responded with force, violently dispersing the protest and sending some 21 people to jail. Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, on Tuesday compared the private facilities for patients to a “paid for vacation.” Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago warned on Wednesday that she is ready and willing to tighten restrictions in her city if cases continue to grow, citing bars that have broken capacity rules recently and new infections among young people. “I won’t just turn the car around,” she said. “I’m going to shut it off, I’m going to kick you out and I’m going to make you walk home.” Chicago is “on the precipice” of dangerous growth in cases, Ms. Lightfoot said. On Wednesday, the city reported 192 cases, the mayor said, though if the daily rate rose above 200, she would take steps to impose more restrictions. Beaches along Lake Michigan, normally a huge draw during the summer, have been closed and will remain closed indefinitely. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois echoed Ms. Lightfoot’s note of caution on Wednesday. At a news conference, he said he was troubled by continuing outbreaks across the state, including those tied to parties, churches and youth sports. When officials see an outbreak that is especially concerning, Mr. Pritzker said, “we need to start tightening mitigations in that region before it’s too late.” As of Tuesday, Illinois had reported an average of 992 cases over seven days, and an average positive test rate of 3 percent over two weeks, according to data compiled by The Times and the Covid Tracking Project. As coronavirus cases surge in Victoria, Australia’s second-biggest state, officials there have barred people from gathering in large groups or traveling to most of the rest of the country. That has not stopped some fast-food aficionados, Pokémon Go players and train stowaways from trying. Four men in their twenties were discovered on an interstate freight train heading from Melbourne, Victoria’s capital, to Perth on the country’s west coast, officials said this week. They were found when officers with dogs searched the train during a stop in Adelaide, in South Australia. The men appeared in court on Wednesday and were released on the condition they do not commit further offenses for 12 months. Separately, six travelers from Victoria who were attempting to enter Queensland with false papers were fined a total of 24,000 Australian dollars ($16,700), the Queensland police said this week. Victoria Police’s deputy commissioner, Rick Nugent, also said that more than 500 fines totaling more than 880,000 Australian dollars ($560,000) had been issued to people caught breaking stay-at home orders or gathering inappropriately since Melbourne’s six-week lockdown began on July 9. Among the violators were two men caught playing the video game Pokémon Go outdoors, and others who were clients of sex workers and massage parlors. And 34 people were fined at a house party in Melbourne last week after the police were called there — twice — in response to noise complaints. In the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong, a suspiciously large KFC takeout order last week led police to more than a dozen people hiding at a house party and 26,000 Australian dollars in fines. Another man refused a police order to leave a KFC restaurant. On Wednesday, Mr. Nugent of the police department asked residents to abide by the new restrictions. “The time for discretion is over,” he said. Australia has recorded at least 10,200 confirmed cases and 110 deaths, according to a Times database; Victoria reported 238 new cases on Wednesday. Australia was initially praised for its response to the pandemic, but a second surge began creeping through Victoria last month and reaching parts of neighboring New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. New South Wales officials have said they would likely introduce new restrictions but stop short of imposing a strict lockdown. Childhood vaccination rates continue to plunge in the wake of the pandemic, and the World Health Organization warned that the fallout from missed vaccinations could end up being worse than Covid-19. “The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than Covid-19 itself,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, said in a statement, Three quarters of the countries that responded to a new survey by the World Health Organization reported disruptions in immunization programs through May. The report, the second to show a drop in vaccinations because of the pandemic, said that at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns were or are at risk of being canceled. It added that other vaccine programs that require three doses, for diseases like diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, reported a substantial drop in the number of children who received vaccinations. “Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the history of public health, and more children are now being immunized than ever before,” Dr. Tedros said in the statement. “But the pandemic has put those gains at risk.” He added that vaccines can still be administered during the pandemic. The study, conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there are a variety of reasons more parents are not getting their children vaccinated. Some are reluctant to leave home, some face restrictions on movement, interruptions to transportation, economic hardships and the fear of exposure to the coronavirus. It also noted that many health workers have been redeployed to work on the pandemic, as well as a lack of protective equipment. The pandemic has taken a toll on pretty much everyone, pretty much everywhere. But it’s proving hard for some people to provide sympathy for one group in particular: Airbnb hosts. On Tuesday, the home-sharing giant messaged its users to say it had a new way to “connect with your favorite hosts.” The company said it was introducing “kindness cards” and the option to add a monetary contribution. “We hope these cards will make hosts smile, and bring a little joy your way,” the message read. Even though the pandemic has had a real impact on individual homeowners and smaller hotel operators who are struggling to make ends meet, the reaction was anything but joyful — instead it was a mix of mockery and surprise. “Flabbergasted that a company the size of @airbnb would solicit past customers for donations to hosts,” one Twitter user wrote. Other people shared the sentiment. “Airbnbs new strategy of sending me an email to ask me to send a “kindness card” to Airbnb hosts I’ve stayed with 3 years ago is just downright bizarre,” someone else tweeted. Airbnb itself has been struggling since the pandemic started crippling the travel industry. In April, the company said it had raised $1 billion in new funding to stockpile cash to deal with the consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. The following month, Airbnb said it would lay off a quarter of its staff. But while Airbnb is asking its users to send some love to their former hosts, a more tangible piece of news emerged on Tuesday as well: In what could be an early sign of recovery as lockdowns ease in places around the globe, Airbnb said people had made more than 1 million reservations on the platform on July 8, Reuters reported, a number that had not been seen since early March. The graffiti artist Banksy unveiled some virus-themed art when he appeared to spray-paint images of rats on the inside of a London Underground train. “If you don’t mask — you don’t get,” said the caption of a post by his Instagram account this week that featured video footage of the spray painting. The BBC reported that art was removed by cleaners.

‘Forest Rambo’ Eludes German Police 3 Days Into Sprawling Hunt,2020-07-15,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — The call to the German police on Sunday seemed a bit odd but routine enough. A man armed with a bow and arrow had been squatting illegally in a small shed outside the village of Oppenau in the foothills of the Black Forest. When four officers arrived, Yves Etienne Rausch, 31, greeted them calmly while seated behind a table in the red shed. He handed over his bow and arrow, and a spear that was by his side. But when officers asked to search him, he drew a gun, threatened one policeman at point blank range and demanded their weapons. Then he ran. And for three days and three nights he has evaded capture despite a manhunt that has involved more than 1,500 police officers and attracted a growing online following. A Facebook page set up in his honor has more than a thousand subscribers and the manhunt has become a running story in Germany’s tabloids, which refer to Mr. Rausch as “Forest Rambo.” The search has turned into an embarrassment for the highly trained and well-equipped state police, who have admitted that they are at a disadvantage against a single foe who had extensive local knowledge and the ability to survive for an extended period of time in the 2,100-acre forest. “The forest is his living room. That’s why — given the impassible and at times steep terrain — it is difficult for us to find him quickly,” said the Offenburg police commissioner Reinhard Renter at a news conference on Tuesday, noting that the police had time on their side. The police blocked roads and briefly closed schools and day care centers in the area as they pursued at least 140 tips. A steady stream of police special forces, helicopters and mobile SWAT teams have swarmed the picturesque mountains around the village of 1,600 in southern Germany near the French border. On Monday alone, 440 officers were looking for Mr. Rausch. Mr. Rausch is now wanted for “aggravated predatory extortion” for the four guns he took from the police, a charge with a minimum sentence of five years of prison; a local judge issued both national and European Union-wide arrest warrants. Known as an eccentric character by locals, who say he often wore a heavy black coat even on the hottest days, Mr. Rausch did not have a reputation as being dangerous. “I know him to be polite, friendly and pleasant,” one local told the SWR, the region’s public broadcaster. But he did have a criminal history. Mr. Rausch spent more than three years in jail for severely injuring a friend with a crossbow after an argument. In the 2010 sentencing, the judge took into account that Mr. Rausch had tried to help his victim and called for medical help after shooting. He also has a police record in connection with car break-ins and petty theft, according to the local state attorney, Herwig Schäfer. In a recent photo Mr. Rausch, who is 5 foot 6 inches tall, is seen in military fatigues wearing an equipment vest, a gas mask and night vision goggles. Police say there are no indications that Mr. Rausch is acting out of a political motive. On Wednesday hundreds of police were still actively searching for Mr. Rausch and weighing options. One possible change of strategy: using the police helicopters’ loudspeakers to broadcast messages to Mr. Rausch in the hope that he gives himself up. “Given his personality, it is also possible that he gives himself up,” said Mr. Renter, who is leading the search, “That he just says he’s done with it; that he says he can’t deal with this situation.”']","A squatter armed with bow and arrow, spear and gun overpowered four officers and fled into the Black Forest on Sunday. Despite a huge search effort, he is still at large."
"After Tight Race for Polish President, Andrzej Duda Wins 2nd Term",2020-07-13,By Monika Pronczuk and Marc Santora,"['WARSAW — President Andrzej Duda of Poland was narrowly elected to a second term after the votes were counted on Monday following the country’s closest presidential election since the end of communist rule in 1989, clearing a potential obstacle for the conservative nationalist government. Mr. Duda and the governing party have fought to control the courts and media, while stoking fear of gay people, the European Union and foreigners. For many in the opposition, the race was not only a contest between competing visions for Poland, but a last chance to save institutions that form the bedrock of a healthy democracy. While the tight vote underscored the extent to which the deep divisions in Poland have only intensified after five years governed by the Law and Justice party, there was no suggestion the government would now change course. Mr. Duda’s promise to protect “traditional families” resonated with older voters and churchgoers, especially in the eastern half of the country, helping him fend off a fierce challenge from Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw. The opposition was fueled by support from young people around the country, securing a majority of votes from people under 50, and turnout was among the highest since the country turned away from communism. Poland’s major cities, from Gdansk in the north to Krakow in the south, were bastions of resistance, but the governing party rallied its faithful in rural communities, many left behind in the rapid transition from communism to capitalism. Mr. Trzaskowski conceded defeat Monday afternoon after the country’s electoral commission said that with 100 percent of the actual vote counted, Mr. Duda had secured 51.03 percent of the vote. Mr. Trzaskowski won 48.97 percent. The turnout was 68.18 percent. While Mr. Duda struck a conciliatory tone in remarks to supporters on Sunday, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on Monday that Mr. Duda would continue to advance the government’s agenda, which he described as “pro-family policies,” a focus on social issues and “a more just redistribution” of wealth. “Most important,” he said, “is to complete the judiciary reform and other state bodies, so everything is more professional, faster.” Writing on Twitter, Mr. Trzaskowski thanked the roughly 10 million people who voted for him, but conceded the contest. It was a bitter defeat for opponents of the government. The Warsaw mayor was not even a candidate when the election was postponed in May because of the coronavirus, but he mounted a serious challenge against an incumbent president who had the backing of state television and important church leaders. With the next parliamentary elections not scheduled until 2023, Mr. Duda’s re-election ensured that the governing party, which also controls the Parliament, will be able to continue to reshape the nation in ways that critics contend undermine open political debate and the rule of law, and put it at odds with the European Union, which has accused Poland of damaging democratic values and institutions. Mr. Trzaskowski had cast the election as a fight for the soul of the nation. He promised to end a government that uses state media to promote its views and silence opposing voices, manipulates the courts and uses fear and division to build support. The mayor, whose campaign rallies were as likely to feature the blue and gold of the European Union flag as the red and white of Poland, said he wanted to live in a country where “an open hand wins against a clenched fist.” Mr. Duda, however, dismissed concerns about Poland’s illiberal drift as an invention of foreign interests. He attacked Mr. Trzaskowski over his support for L.G.B.T. rights — a powerful argument in a staunchly Catholic country, particularly outside its cosmopolitan cities. Thomas Boserup, an independent election observer from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the voting and counting process was carried out well and all the coronavirus precautions were observed. But he said that there were threats reported against journalists and politicians. “The polarization was illustrated by the fact that candidates did not participate in one debate, depriving the voters from comparing their views,” he said, noting that public television had failed in its duty to impartially cover the election. “We were worried by instances of intolerant rhetoric of a homophobic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic nature, particularly among the president’s campaign and the public television.” Mr. Duda’s campaign received a boost recently from President Trump, who met with him at the White House just days before the election and all but endorsed him. “He’s doing a terrific job,” Mr. Trump said of the incumbent. “The people of Poland think the world of him.” An already bitter campaign turned even uglier in the final days before Sunday’s vote, with Mr. Duda, the Law and Justice party and its supporters in the right-wing media launching a barrage of attacks on Mr. Trzaskowski. In the pro-government weekly Sieci, the Warsaw mayor was accused of supporting pedophilia. State television, which has been turned into a propaganda machine for the government, suggested that Mr. Trzaskowski would be controlled by Jewish interests in complicated questions related to restitution of property dating from World War II. Xenophobic arguments are nothing new for Law and Justice, which took power in 2015 on a campaign against accepting migrants, has described itself as defending Christianity against foreign forces, and has tarred the European Union as a threat to national autonomy. But appeals tinged with anti-Semitism, in a country whose Jews were largely wiped out in the Holocaust, were generally off-limits until recently. Independent news outlets faced escalating attacks during the campaign, with the governing party claiming that Germany and other outside powers were trying to meddle in Poland’s affairs. “Have you ever heard such homophobia, such anti-Semitism, such attacks on everybody who is brave enough to say ‘We have had enough’?” Mr. Trzaskowski asked supporters on Friday. “It’s now or never,” he said. While Mr. Trzaskowski and Mr. Duda represented very different visions for Poland, they have remarkably similar backgrounds. Both were born in 1972 and raised by families considered part of the country’s intelligentsia, and both were academics before entering politics as ministers in the European Union. But their visions for the nation of roughly 38 million could hardly have been more different. Those differences echoed debates playing out in other nations, where traditional democratic values like pluralism have come under assault from populist leaders who undermine institutions and civil society to concentrate power. While the Polish president has limited authority, the office comes with veto power, which Mr. Trzaskowski vowed to use to provide a counterweight to Law and Justice. The leader of the Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, speaking on a popular Catholic broadcast station, accused the Warsaw mayor of lacking a “Polish soul” and a “Polish heart.” “Those who currently push to seize power — at present in the presidential elections, but it’s a known fact that it’s not only about that — these are people who question everything which constitutes our tradition,” Mr. Kaczynski said on Friday. “We just don’t want to have decisions being made somewhere outside of the Polish borders.” While the coronavirus led to a delay in the election, allowing Mr. Trzaskowski to enter the race in May, it was not a major focus of the campaign. Still, the precautions taken at polling stations — including social-distancing requirements — were a reminder of the lingering threat. And with Law and Justice drawing much of its support from older voters, the party redoubled its efforts to ensure that fear of the virus would not limit turnout. “I can assure you, like many others have, that participation in these elections is really absolutely safe,” Mr. Kaczynski said. “It’s even safer than going to the grocery store.” An alert from the Government Security Center, which normally sends out text messages warning of bad weather, was delivered to Polish mobile phones on Saturday reminding people of the elections. “People over the age of 60+, pregnant women and disabled people are entitled to vote at the polling stations without waiting in line,” the alert noted. In the end, it was older voters that gave Mr. Duda the edge he needed.   Monika Pronczuk reported from Warsaw, and Marc Santora from London. Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting from Warsaw.']","The close fight revealed deep divisions, but Mr. Duda’s victory cleared the path for Poland’s government to continue with a nationalist agenda that critics fear is undermining democratic institutions."
"In Rare Surge of Online Unity, Iranians Call for Halt to Executions",2020-07-15,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Iranians from all walks of life — teachers, doctors, designers, cooks, actors, directors, artists, homemakers, bloggers — have taken to social media with a message for the government: Stop the executions. The online campaign, which took place on Tuesday and which analysts said was remarkable for its scope and the breadth of its support, was in response to the judiciary’s announcement earlier in the day that it had upheld the death sentences of three young men who joined antigovernment protests in November. Iran put 251 people to death last year, more than any country but China, according to Amnesty International. In recent weeks, many Iranians have been rattled by a series of executions based on murky charges, from drinking alcohol to political activism to allegedly spying for the C.I.A. “I’m next, you’re next, we’re next,” read a meme that was widely shared online. It was a rare moment of solidarity among Iranians of varying political views around a single issue. Human rights activists said it suggested that Iranians were seeking new ways to be heard, with the government having brutally crushed street protests and other forms of dissent. By midday Tuesday, the most-tweeted hashtag within Iran was #DontExecute in Persian, according to Twitter. Iranians all over the world joined the campaign, and the hashtag trended globally, with nearly 4.5 million tweets. “I’ve never seen a hashtag with this level of participation from Iranians everywhere,” said Amir Rashidi, a digital researcher with a focus on internet security. Past issues, including political prisoners and Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, had generated considerable social media engagement, but not like what was seen on Tuesday, he said. The call to end executions also generated tens of thousands of posts on other platforms popular in Iran, like Instagram and Telegram. NetBlocks, which tracks global internet usage, reported significant internet disruption within Iran on Tuesday night, as did individual Iranians. The government routinely disrupts or shuts off the internet and mobile services when faced with demonstrations or significant internal dissent. The three condemned men, Amirhossein Moradi, 25, Saeed Tamjidi, 27, and Mohammad Rajabi, 27, were part of a nationwide uprising in November as people took to the streets to protest rising gasoline prices. Rights organizations say the security forces killed at least 500 protesters, and 7,000 people were arrested. The three were charged with “participation in vandalism and arson with the intent to confront and engage in war with the Islamic Republic of Iran.” In an open letter, the men’s lawyers said their clients had been forced to confess under “aberrant conditions.” The Supreme Court turned down an appeal and upheld the death sentences on Tuesday, the judiciary announced. A broad range of Iranians joined the online campaign denouncing the sentences. “Every human life is precious. #DontExecute,” Mojgan Rezaei, a lifestyle blogger in Tehran, wrote on Instagram, where she has more than 200,000 followers. “We are overwhelmed with grief, running out of time to mourn. #DontExecute,” tweeted a Tehran-based economist, Siamak Ghasemi. Well-known figures followed, some of them with millions of followers: Mohsen Chavoshi, a pop singer; Azar Mahisefat, a grandmother and a food blogger; Taraneh Alidousti, an actress; Asghar Farhadi, a filmmaker who has won two Oscars. Hossein Mahini, a player for Iran’s beloved national soccer team, sent a tweet with the #DontExecute hashtag written three times, once for each of the men facing death. Ordinary internet users who rarely weigh in on political issues shared photos of the three men. Sara, a homemaker with two young daughters who asked that her last name not be reported, posted a photo of three bleeding red roses and wrote: “Enough. Don’t execute life.” Politicians took notice. Former Vice President Mohamad Ali Abtahi, a cleric, warned in a tweet that the government should not be stubborn in the face of such strong public opinion. A former member of Parliament, Parvaneh Salahshouri, tweeted a line of poetry about oppression with the #DontExecute hashtag. “Nothing shakes and weakens the foundations of the government and provokes public retaliation like spilling the blood of innocent people,” Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent reformist politician, wrote on Twitter, also using the hashtag. Iranians, including advocates for human rights, said the government was making an example of the three men to intimidate the public and pre-empt any future uprisings, amid widespread discontent over the dismal economy and the authorities’ handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Iran’s currency has been in a daily free fall. This week, rials were trading at 230,000 to the dollar; a month ago, the figure was 130,000. Prices for basic goods have been fluctuating drastically. And the pandemic continues to rage, with daily case numbers climbing and 25 provinces having been declared “red zones.” “The society is boiling, so they are increasing the number of executions,” said Roya Boroumand, executive director of the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which pushes for human rights in Iran. The message, she said, was “remember we can kill.”\xa0']","Actors, scholars, star athletes and millions of others called for three young protesters’ lives to be spared. “I’m next, you’re next, we’re next,” one meme read."
"For U.K.’s Minority Women, Economic Toll of Lockdown Lingers",2020-07-15,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — Within 10 days of the British government’s lockdown announcement in late March, one woman lost all nine of her cleaning jobs. Another was laid off from a laundromat after she requested a mask, and a live-in nanny was fired for using public transport on her day off. In separate interviews, the three women said that they had expected to confront hardships during the lockdown. But as the economy starts to reopen, they and other women on the lower rungs of the economy say they are still struggling, weighed down by debts accumulated during the freeze and often facing pay cuts or forced to do more work for the same wages. The three have one other thing in common. They are all women of color, a group that has long faced economic and racial inequality in Britain and is now being hit disproportionately by the financial and psychological impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recent study by a group of British universities and women’s charities. “Covid-19 has brought the harsh realities of pre-existing racial inequalities into sharp relief, and nowhere is this more manifest than the disproportionate social and economic impact of Covid-19 on Black and ethnic minority women,” said Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the Runnymede Trust, a London-based organization advocating racial equality. The main reason that people of color are so vulnerable, experts say, is that they are more likely to be in precarious employment or to become unemployed, making it harder for them to qualify for government support and to protect themselves from the virus. Minji Paik, a Korean beautician who works in a hair salon in East London, said she made 15 pounds an hour before the pandemic, about $19 dollars, plus tips. Now she is making £10 an hour, and has been working longer shifts because of staff shortages. “My manager says this is temporary and she will give me more money when we make money,” Ms. Paik said. “But actually, I should be paid more because I’m working inside and risking my health.” A government review of the disparities in the risk and outcomes from the coronavirus found that death rates have been higher in Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups than in white groups. The review found that Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and other Asians, as well as Caribbeans and other Black people, had from 10 percent to 50 percent higher risk of death than white Britons. “There’s often a risk when people start talking about the underlying causes of death because of the assumption that the reason is related to genetics or poor diets,” said Bridget Byrne, director of the Center on Dynamics of Ethnicity at the University of Manchester. “But actually, you need to look at the wider process of racism and the structuring of race and deprivation.” The precarious nature of the current labor market is a contributing factor as well, Ms. Byrne said. “It makes people less willing to voice their concerns, they worry that if they say, ‘I don’t feel safe, I don’t think I should be coming in,’ they will be the first to be laid off.” Candice Brown, 48, a cleaner who is of Jamaican descent, said she had lost all her clients when lockdown measures were imposed in March. “They phoned me one by one to say don’t come,” she recalled, referring to the owners of the nine houses she cleaned each week in the city of Manchester, in northwestern England. “Each call was like a bomb, blasting every bit of my livelihood until I had no work left.” For two months she tried to navigate the government’s financial support system for those affected by the pandemic, and even borrowed money from a friend to hire an accountant to help. But eventually, she found out that she was not eligible for any aid because she lacked the paperwork to prove her employment history. “I applied for universal credit,” she said referring to the government’s income support program. “But I am still waiting. I haven’t received a penny.” Even with the easing of the lockdown measures, Ms. Brown has not been invited back to work because her employers fear that she could contract and spread the virus by working between multiple households. “I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this,” she said. “In the first month, I was worrying about how to pay my rent and my bills, now I can’t sleep worrying about how to feed my children.” A survey published by the Fawcett Society, a women’s rights charity, found that nearly 43 percent of Black and ethnic minority women believed that they would be in more debt than before the pandemic, compared with 37 percent of white women and 34 percent of white men. More than four in 10 of the women said they would struggle to make ends meet over the next three months. Many are tasked with carrying out menial tasks that can be perilous in a pandemic, a recent study by the Runnymede Trust found. Zuhr Rind, 48, a Pakistani laundromat worker in East London, was asked to work the last shift when the pandemic broke out so that she could wash the uniforms of the front-of-house employees, who collected laundry from clients. “I was not happy about it, but what could I do? Work is work and I was afraid to lose my job if I made an argument,” she said. When she asked for a face mask, her manager chided her, she said. “That is pathetic Z,” her manager wrote back in a text message she showed to The New York Times. “Doctors and nurses do not even have enough masks and they’re still going to work.” A day later, Ms. Rind said, she was laid off. “When you have brown skin, when you have an accent and when you don’t have a high education, you don’t have choices,” she said. “And this is a very dangerous situation to be in during Covid.” The laundromat where she worked did not respond to a request for comment. Ms. Rind was recently offered a cleaning job in a hotel but was forced to turn it down because she lives 40 minutes away and, as a precaution against the virus, the employer did not want her to take public transport. Black and ethnic minority women also generally have much lower levels of savings and assets than white Britons, according to the Runnymede Trust study. So those who lost their jobs in the pandemic have had to seek new employment straight away, forcing some of them to take lower-paid, higher-risk posts. Verona Pollard, an experienced nanny and maternity nurse, has taken up part-time child care work since she was fired from a full-time nannying job, after her employer found out she had taken public transport on her days off. “She was ruthless about it and wouldn’t take me back, even when the lockdown was lifted,” she said in a phone interview. “ It’s been brutal since then, I’m just doing odd jobs here and there.” And in the Fawcett Society’s survey, work-related anxiety was highest among Black and minority ethnic women, with 65.1 percent of women employed outside the home reporting that they felt apprehensive as a result of having to go to work during the pandemic. Ms. Brown, the cleaner in Manchester, said that she was still waiting for her unemployment benefits to come through and that she had been borrowing money from a friend and from a former employer to get by. In recent weeks, she said she has become so stressed and anxious that rashes have broken out over her body and she has noticed her hair falling out. “I promise you, what I am going through now is worse than any virus,” she said.']","Black and other ethnic minority groups have long faced economic and racial inequality in Britain.

"Taliban Stage a Major Attack, as Violence Intensifies in Northern Afghanistan",2020-07-13,By Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban waged a sustained assault against an Afghan intelligence complex in the city of Aybak on Monday, killing at least 11 people and wounding more than 60 others, part of a bloody wave of violence across the country’s north. With the opening of peace talks between the insurgency and the Afghan government stalled for months, the Taliban have intensified their offensives, creating one of the deadliest years of the long war. On Monday, insurgents detonated a car bomb at the entrance of the provincial headquarters of Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security in Aybak, the capital of Samangan Province, about 150 miles northwest of Kabul. The blast, which also struck a nearby municipal compound, opened the way for fighters to enter the intelligence agency complex, where they battled the Afghan forces for hours, said Sefatullah Samangani, the deputy governor of the province. Mr. Samangani said 11 officers of the intelligence agency, mostly men but at least one woman, were killed and 63 others were wounded. Only 15 of the wounded were intelligence officers and the rest civilians. “The blast was so strong that it broke people’s windows three kilometers away,” Mr. Samangani said. “The building of the intelligence agency and the municipality building are not usable anymore.”  Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, confirmed that the insurgency was behind the attack. A major attack inside a city seems to breach an understanding between the United States and the Taliban, which signed a preliminary peace deal in February that begun the withdrawal of American forces. And it broke with the Taliban tactics in recent months of escalating violence in the countryside without claiming many of the attacks, while the cities were largely spared except for hit-and-run assassinations.  The deal, in which the Taliban guaranteed that they would not attack American targets, has faced criticism because it lacked any guarantee of a cease-fire with Afghans. But American officials have said that they had an understanding with the Taliban that the insurgents would reduce their levels of violence by as much as 80 percent and not attack in major cities and population centers. Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, called on the Taliban to stop what he described as “criminal and inhumane” attacks that could derail the peace efforts.  “Turning to violence and killing people for leverage in negotiations is the worst approach that, unfortunately, the Taliban have taken up,” Mr. Ghani said in a statement. The violence continues unabated as the poor nation grapples with the spread of Covid-19 and its economic ramifications. Although official numbers are dubious, with testing capacity extremely low, the country’s health ministry has recorded nearly 35,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths. The February deal was expected to open the way within 10 days for the more complicated part of the peace process: talks with the Afghan government over a future power-sharing agreement. But those talks have been repeatedly delayed over complications with a prisoner swap that was laid out as a precondition for negotiations. The American deal with the Taliban called for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for 1,000 Afghan security forces held by the insurgents — a clause that angered many Afghan officials. After balking for weeks, the Afghan government began a phased release of Taliban prisoners, under heavy pressure from the Trump administration. But with more than 4,000 Taliban released, the last stretch is once again facing difficulty, as the Afghan government says it cannot release about 500 of those on the Taliban list because they are deemed dangerous and are accused of serious crimes. Javid Faisal, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s National Security Council, said the government has proposed that the Taliban suggest new names instead of the 592 that cannot be released. It is unclear whether the insurgents have agreed to that. “We have told them that we are ready to release alternative people,” Mr. Faisal said. The ongoing attack in Samangan caps a bloody 24 hours in northern Afghanistan, where Taliban launched attacks in several provinces, officials said. At least 20 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in overnight assaults in two districts of Kunduz Province. In Badakhshan Province, the Taliban attacked security posts in Arghanj Khwa district, killing at least seven from the security forces.

"Driver Purposely Drove Bus Into China Reservoir, Killing 21, Police Say",2020-07-13,By Tiffany May,"['A bus crash in southwest China last week that killed 21 people and injured 15 others was caused by the driver, who deliberately steered into a reservoir because he was angry at the demolition of his home, the police have said. The crash on Tuesday, which also killed the driver, drew an outpouring of grief; some of the passengers included students traveling to take China’s notoriously difficult college entrance exam. The police in Anshun, a city in Guizhou Province, said in a statement on Sunday that the 52-year-old driver, identified only by his last name, Zhang, had been aggrieved over the demolition of his home that morning. The driver crashed the passenger bus, the police said, to send a message. “Due to his dissatisfaction with his life’s circumstances and the demolition of rented public housing and in order to cause a stir, he has committed extreme crimes that endanger public safety,” the police report said. The authorities said the driver had rented a 430-square-foot unit in a state-owned public housing structure included in a redevelopment scheme. He signed an agreement in June to receive $10,000 in compensation, but did not claim the sum. His applications for public housing were rejected, but plans for the demolition of the building went forward. The case shines a light on the often-silent victims displaced by China’s urban redevelopment schemes, in which state-sponsored developers tear down older, shabbier buildings in dilapidated neighborhoods to build gleaming office towers, shopping malls and expensive housing. On Tuesday morning, the bus driver called a government hotline to complain that his home was about to be demolished before he could receive government housing, the police report said. He then traded shifts with a colleague and bought some baijiu, a colorless alcoholic drink, that he took to work in a water bottle. He left some voice messages for his girlfriend on WeChat, expressing weariness and disgust with the world, and sipped from the bottle before starting his shift, the police report said. Security video showed the bus cutting across three lanes of oncoming traffic around midday Tuesday as it traveled along Hongshan Lake in Anshun. It then plunged down a series of low terraces and into the lake, becoming submerged by more than 30 feet of water. Some passengers were students preparing to take the gaokao, the national college placement test, reported The Paper, a state-run online publication based in Shanghai. At least five of those killed were students, officials said. The gaokao, which began on Tuesday, was delayed for a month because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 10 million students are participating this year. Caixin, a Chinese-language magazine, published an article on Friday about the demolition of the bus driver’s home and his efforts to stop it. The story, which drew sympathy for the working-class residents displaced by urban redevelopment projects in China, was later taken offline. The government authorities in Anshun said in a statement on Sunday that they would investigate the demolition, and any mistakes made in the process. Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.']","The 52-year-old driver, who was also killed, was aggrieved about the demolition of his home because of a redevelopment scheme, officials said."
Homesick Student Cycles From Scotland to Greece During the Pandemic,2020-07-15,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Nearly a month into the coronavirus lockdown, Kleon Papadimitriou, a Greek student in Aberdeen, Scotland, was feeling homesick. Restless — and with flights to much of Europe canceled — he was looking for a way home to Athens. His father joked that he could simply walk, and a light bulb went on. What if he cycled? “I wanted something big, a project for the year,” the younger Mr. Papadimitriou said by phone on Tuesday. What followed was a cycling journey across Europe that spanned five countries, more than 2,000 miles and 48 days, with Mr. Papadimitriou finally arriving home in Athens late last month. Mr. Papadimitriou, 20, studies electrical and electronic engineering at the University of Aberdeen, but when classes stopped, he found himself with a sudden surplus of time and energy. So, turning the strictures of the pandemic into an opportunity and motivation, he began planning his trip by bike across a coronavirus-hit Europe. Less than a month later, on May 10, he was packed and ready to leave Aberdeen, in northeastern Scotland, with a handful of essential supplies. Making the cut: phone, power bank, some tools, two changes of clothes, a raincoat, a windbreaker, a tent, sleeping bag, food for four days and water. A book he had wanted to bring took up too much space, so had to be left behind. In the beginning, he had daily regrets about his self-inflicted odyssey, he said. His first day on the road proved trying. “My parents did not know where I was, I started crying,” he said. “I didn’t know where I’d stay for the night.” He asked a pizza delivery man, who directed him to a nearby grove, where he regrouped, had some food and called his parents. “I learned a lot of things about myself, about handling myself in difficult situations, when I have a low morale, and how important some relationships are,” he said. Besides getting lost, the first days of his trip were full of difficulties that included flat tires, bad weather, and steep climbs. When he set out, he planned to cover about 125 miles a day. But he soon realized that such a goal would be unlikely. Instead, he covered about 75 miles a day at most. A week into his journey, he arrived at a friend’s house in Leeds, a city in northern England, where he stayed for two days. He also took his first shower since leaving Scotland. Departing again was a challenge. “I was thinking ‘God, what am I doing with my life,’ ” he said. But his spirits lifted when he reached his first milestone: boarding a ferry from Britain to the Netherlands, and crossing his first national border. “It was the point of no return,” he said. Four days later, and after staying at campsites, he made it to Germany. Friends of friends let him stay over, though most did not want him inside their houses because of the coronavirus, so he set up his tent in their gardens. He was being careful around people too, wary of getting sick while on the road. He made it to another important, milestone: Stuttgart, where his grandmother lives. “It was very important to me, it was like a checkpoint,” he said. “I hadn’t seen my grandma for so many years, and the only thing I cared about was, if something were to happen to me, I didn’t want it to happen before I got to Stuttgart.” He stayed with her for a week to rest and refuel, his first time eating a proper homemade meal after weeks of a meager diet. After Germany came Italy, where businesses were gradually reopening after the first wave of the pandemic. He had a pepperoni pizza and a beer in the Italian Alps before heading to Venice, where he stayed for a day. Then it was on to Ancona, a seaside city on the Adriatic coast, where he boarded a ferry to Patras, in the Peloponnese region of Greece. “The moment I believed I could make it was when I boarded the ferry from Ancona,” Mr. Papadimitriou said, adding that before he had begun his journey he had estimated that it would take a maximum of 30 days. That turned out to be optimistic. Mr. Papadimitriou finally made it to Greece on June 25, 46 days after leaving Aberdeen. His parents met him in Patras, where he was tested for the coronavirus — the result was negative — and the three of them cycled the final stretch together. On June 27, they arrived home in Athens. “I think that if I had not already done it, and if someone were to tell me I could do it, I wouldn’t believe it,” he said. “I had no idea that I had the patience and the willpower.” He hopes to take another journey along the same lines — or bigger — in the future, he said. For now, he is resting at home and enjoying a more varied diet than the foods that sustained him for much of his 48-day trip. “I want to take some time off sardines,” he said. “I think I liked them because I was so hungry but now I don’t even want to look at them.”']","It took the 20-year-old Kleon Papadimitriou 48 days to travel from Aberdeen to Athens, riding more than 2,000 miles as the coronavirus shut down other modes of transport."
China Imposes Tit-for-Tat Sanctions on Three American Lawmakers,2020-07-13,By Keith Bradsher,"['BEIJING — As tensions between the two sides mount, the Chinese government announced on Monday that it would impose sanctions on three American lawmakers and a diplomat in retaliation for similar moves last week by the Trump administration against four  officials in China. The largely symbolic sanctions targeted Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, all of whom are Republicans. Also named were Sam Brownback, President Trump’s ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, a United States government agency that focuses on human rights. The Trump administration imposed its sanctions in response to what it describes as pervasive human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang region, home to the largely Muslim Uighur minority. The administration banned four Chinese officials and a Chinese government agency last Thursday from accessing American banks and other financial institutions. It also restricted them from obtaining visas to the United States.  Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday that China had to react to American interference in its domestic affairs. “We urge the U.S. side to immediately revoke the wrong decision and stop any words and deeds that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests,” Ms. Hua said at a news briefing. “China will make further response according to the development of the situation.” Ms. Hua described the Chinese sanctions as “corresponding.” But she did not provide details on how they might prevent the targeted Americans from using China’s financial system or obtaining Chineses visas. The sanctions are likely to be mostly symbolic on both sides, as neither the Chinese officials nor the Americans are known to have assets in each other’s financial systems. Relations between the United States and China are increasingly strained. The administration has banned certain high-tech exports to Hong Kong in response to a newly imposed national security law in the territory, while President Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic, an accusation Beijing resents. The Trump administration took the latest action after weeks of heavy pressure from Congress, including an overwhelming, bipartisan vote by the House in May in favor of penalties against senior Chinese officials in Xinjiang. The United States applied sanctions to Chen Quanguo — a member of China’s 25-member ruling Politburo and party secretary of the Xinjiang region. The administration also penalized Zhu Hailun, a former deputy party secretary for the region; Wang Mingshan, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau; and Huo Liujun, a former party secretary of the bureau. The bureau itself was also included in the sanctions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday that the American sanctions were in response to “forced labor, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith.” Chinese security forces have rounded up as many as a million mostly Muslim members of ethnic minorities in barbed-wire camps and prisons for extensive indoctrination, among other human rights abuses. The Chinese government began its crackdown several years ago after a series of attacks on civilians that Beijing attributed to Uighur extremists. Ms. Hua said on Monday that the Chinese government was “unswervingly determined to combat violent and terrorist forces, separatist forces and religious extremist forces.” Claire Fu contributed research.']","The sanctions, which target Republican members of Congress, were in retaliation for the Trump administration’s bans on Chinese officials accused of human rights abuses."
"Suriname Elects a New President, Ending Bouterse’s Long Rule",2020-07-13,By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Harmen Boerboom,"['Suriname elected a new president on Monday, ending the long rule of Desi Bouterse, who dominated the small South American nation’s politics since its independence through intimidation and charisma. The president, Chan Santokhi, a 61-year-old former police chief and leader of the opposition, was elected to the office by Suriname’s Congress following a landslide opposition victory in the May general elections. In handing Mr. Santokhi a victory, the Surinamese punished Mr. Bouterse, a former military dictator turned populist champion, for a disastrous economic crisis and the widespread corruption in his government. Mr. Santokhi takes charge of a deeply divided nation teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and struggling to contain the coronavirus, which has infected 741 people and killed 18. “We’re on the brink of a financial abyss,” Mr. Santokhi said in Congress Monday, as he promised to unite Suriname’s ethnically diverse citizens. “This crisis has surpassed every worst-case scenario we had expected.” Suriname’s longer-term prospects appear brighter, as the country is expected to begin exploiting major new offshore oil discoveries by 2026. The new government will have to rebuild Suriname’s damaged relations with the Netherlands, Suriname’s former colonial ruler and major trade partner, whose judges had convicted Mr. Bouterse of drug trafficking in absentia in 1999. In the last 10 years in office, Mr. Bouterse had shifted Suriname’s foreign alliances away from the Netherlands and toward China and nearby Venezuela, whose redistributive economic policies and anti-imperialist rhetoric he copied at home. Mr. Bouterse leaves power as he appeals another criminal conviction, this time at home, for his role in the murder of 15 prominent political opponents following a 1980 military coup. Even as he loses his presidential immunity, it is unclear that he will serve the 20 year sentence the court handed down. As police chief, Mr. Santokhi had investigated Mr. Bouterse for his role in the violence connected to the coup, a deeply traumatizing event for Suriname’s older generation known as the “December Murders.” Some in Suriname, however, fear that trying to enforce the homicide sentence could provoke riots from Mr. Bouterse’s well-organized supporters and make the small nation ungovernable. After four decades of running the country in different guises, Mr. Bouterse retains strong connections in the Suriname’s military, commands a large personal fortune and enjoys the adoration of a loyal base. But in a sign of conciliation, Mr. Bouterse, an elected lawmaker, made a rare appearance in Congress on Monday, where he congratulated the new government. “Out of experience, I can tell you it won’t be an easy job,” Mr. Bouterse said. In an attempt to maintain his support ahead of elections, Mr. Bouterse raided the reserves of private banks and imposed restrictions on foreign exchange rates earlier this year. The moves proved popular with his core supporters but provoked an unprecedented backlash from the private sector and devastated an already damaged economy. Economic mismanagement proved to be Mr. Bouterse’s undoing. The Surinamese abandoned his ruling party in droves, voting many of his chief allies out of power. Mr. Bouterse’s top economic policymaker, Amzad Abdoel, received 117 votes out of more than 70,000 cast in his congressional district.']","Desi Bouterse has cast a long shadow over Suriname since its independence.

A Health Worker Raised Alarms About the Coronavirus. Then He Lost His Job.,2020-07-13,By Emma Bubola,"['MILAN — In February, he said the directors of the nursing home where he worked kept him from wearing a mask, fearing it would scare patients and their families. In March, he became infected and spoke out about the coronavirus spreading through the home. In May, he was fired amid claims that he had “damaged the company’s image.” Hamala Diop, a 25-year-old medical assistant, challenged the decision in a lawsuit that was first heard in court on Monday. The proceedings will raise the issue of whether whistle-blowers have paid a price in raising alarms about dangerous conditions at medical facilities. After successfully lowering the curve of new cases after a devastating initial outbreak, Italy is now bracing for a potential second wave. The country, with the oldest population in Europe, was affected especially deeply by the coronavirus, and nearly half the infections reported in April happened in nursing homes, according to the Italian National Institute of Health. The breadth of the outbreak put the management of nursing homes under judicial and media scrutiny. As the country fears the emergence of new clusters, some worry that Mr. Diop’s experience could have a chilling effect on those seeking to raise early warnings about potentially dangerous behaviors. “Nobody protected us from catching the virus,” Mr. Diop said, “and nobody protected us from getting fired.” On Feb. 26, as officials had already sealed off towns in the northern region of Lombardy, a director at the Palazzolo Institute of the Don Gnocchi Foundation, a nursing home in Milan where Mr. Diop worked, walked to the ward where Mr. Diop and his colleagues were tidying up the dining room. Mr. Diop said in an interview the director told them not to wear masks, that the building was safe and that they should not scare the residents. When presented with this account, the foundation said that they had always rejected any accusation that the employees were kept from using masks as “serious and baseless.” For more than two weeks, while the coronavirus epidemic was exploding in the region, Mr. Diop said that he and his colleagues washed, changed and fed the residents without wearing masks or other protection. More than 150 residents would die in March and April, according to Milan’s prosecutors investigating the case. Asked if that figure was accurate, nursing home officials declined to comment. “They watched TV and saw what was going on outside,” he said of the residents, “but I had to reassure them and tell them that the virus will never come into our safe place.” The human resources director encouraged managers to place on leave employees who “polemicized” or insisted on wearing protective gear “even when they are not required to,” according to an email submitted as evidence. Mr. Diop said that he received his first mask on March 12, when more than 15,000 people in the country had already been infected and days after the government had imposed nationwide restrictions on movement and work. That same day, Mr. Diop fell ill. A week later, his swab test came back positive for the virus. His mother, who also works at the home, was infected, too. Eleven days after becoming sick, he filed his complaint along with 17 colleagues, most of whom also had the virus. In it, they argued that management had covered up the first coronavirus cases among the staff and prevented them from using the necessary protective gear, contributing to the spread in the nursing home. “We are their arms and their legs and they all become like our grandpas and grandmas,” Mr. Diop said of the residents. “And they kept us from protecting them,” he said in reference to the management. In a statement, the foundation’s lawyers said the home had followed the instructions of the Italian National Institute of Health on the use of masks, and that communications about the infections among workers took place according to privacy laws. After news of the lawsuit was published by Italian newspapers, dozens of victims’ families filed similar complaints. Milanese prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the home’s management. On May 7, Mr. Diop was fired by the cooperative that employed him, a subcontractor for the foundation, for talking to reporters about the lawsuit, and many of his colleagues have also been transferred or dismissed. Mr. Diop challenged the decision, and his lawyer, Romolo Reboa, argues in court filings that Italian and European laws on whistle-blowers should protect workers who raise alarms about situations that put lives at risk. Mr. Reboa cited a similar case of a nurse in Rome who was fired after anonymously speaking on the radio about the lack of masks in his hospital. “In nursing homes, the politics of Covid was if you speak, you get sanctioned,” Mr. Reboa said. “And this created a climate of intimidation that had a direct impact on the number of deaths.” Mr. Diop, originally from Mali, lives with his parents and two siblings in Cormano, a small town north of Milan. He said that losing his job was a serious financial setback and that he was worried he would not find new work given his record. While he had expected to face some consequences for his actions, he said he did not think he would lose his job, since the government had imposed a freeze on layoffs during the emergency and health care workers were particularly in demand. “We only are heroes when they like it,” he said.']",A lawsuit by a nursing home employee in Italy will test whether health care professionals are paying a price for pointing out dangerous conditions at medical facilities.
Egyptian Dissident Battles Extradition in Spanish Court,2020-07-14,By Raphael Minder and Declan Walsh,"['MADRID — An Egyptian dissident whose online videos ignited a flurry of rare antigovernment protests last year is fighting against extradition from Spain, as President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt campaigns to silence his most vocal critics abroad. The dissident, the construction magnate Mohamed Ali, has been living in self-imposed exile in Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia since 2018. Last year he posted a series of videos about corruption in Mr. el-Sisi’s circle, driven by his own complaints of being cheated, that set off a powerful wave of street protests in Cairo and several other cities. Several thousand young protesters clashed with the police and chanted slogans in an unusual show of defiance against Mr. el-Sisi’s oppressive rule. Now Mr. Ali faces the prospect of being sent home to face charges of tax evasion and money laundering. He appeared before a Spanish judge via videoconference for a preliminary hearing on July 9, and has been given 45 days to present a case for why he should not be sent back. In an email, Mr. Ali, who had previously worked with Egypt’s military for 15 years, dismissed the charges as a thinly veiled effort to punish him for his activism. The extradition request is the latest effort by Egypt to use legal tools and other means to silence Mr. el-Sisi’s most outspoken critics in countries where they are otherwise beyond the reach of his powerful security services. Since 2013, Egyptian prosecutors have made numerous extradition requests to countries in Europe and Asia for the return of dissidents, especially leaders of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. The requests have mostly failed but some dissidents have been held in prison or had their assets frozen for months in countries like Albania, Ukraine and India while they fought extradition. The Egyptian authorities have also sought to exert pressure on expatriate critics by targeting their relatives inside Egypt. Last month, an American citizen, Mohammed Soltan, filed a lawsuit in an American court accusing Egyptian officials of torture and other abuses during his two-year imprisonment on political charges that ended in 2015. The suit named Hazem el-Beblawi, a former prime minister of Egypt who lives in the United States and sits on the executive board of the International Monetary Fund. Soon after the lawsuit was filed, Egyptian security officials raided the homes of Mr. Soltan’s relatives in Egypt and detained five men, who remain in custody. The authorities also interrogated Mr. Soltan’s father, a Muslim Brotherhood leader who has been in jail for years. Egypt has used similar tactics before against dissidents in exile in countries like Turkey and Qatar, but rarely against American citizens, or in apparent response to lawsuits filed in American courts. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on June 30, a group of Egypt experts denounced the arrests as an apparent attempt to force Mr. Soltan to drop his lawsuit. “They represent blatant interference in the U.S. justice system and an affront to his legal rights as an American citizen,” said the letter from the Working Group on Egypt, a bipartisan group that seeks to influence American policy toward Egypt. Mr. Ali, the building contractor, worked on major development projects in Egypt for 15 years. Though Mr. Ali is a charismatic, flamboyant man who once appeared in a movie he also produced, few anticipated that the videos he posted about official corruption last September would have much impact. But his account of corruption in the country’s ruling circles, burnished by accounts of extravagant and highhanded behavior by Mr. el-Sisi’s family, touched a nerve with young Egyptians who took to the streets on Sept. 20. After being initially caught off-guard, the authorities clamped down hard on a second wave of protests a week later, eventually arresting over 2,300 people according to Amnesty International. Mr. Ali initially appeared to relish his standing as a populist rebel, and fended off accusations that his activism had been quietly encouraged by Mr. el-Sisi’s political opponents. In an interview last year, he said he had no personal political ambitions but wanted to act as a uniting force for rival groups opposed to Mr. el-Sisi, including the Muslim Brotherhood. Since then, Mr. Ali has largely receded into the background. His family has faced harassment by the Egyptian security forces and he has privately expressed frustration to other activists that the protest movement ultimately failed to shake Mr. el-Sisi’s power. An Egyptian court sentenced Mr. Ali in absentia to five years imprisonment on tax evasion charges in February and ordered him to pay about $250,000 in back taxes. In its 20-page filing to Spain’s judiciary, Egypt repeated many of those accusations, saying that he had struck property deals dating to 2006, “without declaring part of his sales.” The filing calls on Spain to send Mr. Ali back to Egypt to stand trial on charges of money laundering and tax evasion. He denies the charges. “I left Egypt two years ago and no one stopped me. If I have done fraud, why did they let me leave the country?” he said. Egypt and Spain do not have an extradition treaty, so the request must be decided by a judge. Egypt made a similar request after the Arab Spring in 2011, when it pursued the extradition from Spain of Hussein Salem, a close confidant of the former president, Hosni Mubarak, accusing Mr. Salem of fraud. Spain’s constitutional court eventually turned down the request because Mr. Salem had become a Spanish citizen and had renounced his Egyptian nationality. Mr. Salem later struck a deal with Mr. el-Sisi’s government to be allowed to return home in exchange for a payment of $600 million. In 2017, an Egyptian court dropped the final fraud charges against him. Mr. Ali said that he hoped that Spain’s courts would also side with him against Egypt, because Spain was “a fair country that fights for human rights.”']","Mohamed Ali made videos critical of Egypt’s government, touching off protests.

"Speaking on Charity Scandal, Trudeau Adopts a Now-Familiar Tone of Contrition",2020-07-14,By Catherine Porter,"['After digging in his heels for days, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada changed tack on Monday and apologized for taking part in a decision to award a no-bid government contract to a charity deeply connected to his family. The apology came four days after it was revealed that the prime minister’s mother and brother had received more than $200,000 over four years to give speeches at events for the development organization, called the WE Charity, which had been awarded a government contract to oversee the disbursement of hundreds of millions of dollars of student grants. “I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions given our family’s history, and I’m sincerely sorry about not having done that,” said Mr. Trudeau from outside his Ottawa home, during one of the briefings he has given regularly since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. At Monday’s news conference, the virus took a back seat to a sustained grilling from reporters about the charity scandal. The controversy began brewing earlier this month, when opposition politicians demanded an investigation into the government’s approval of the contract to the charity to distribute about $660 million in grants to student volunteers affected by the weakened economy. The prime minister, who said Monday that the contract was selected by the country’s civil service, has spoken at many of WE Charity’s events, and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, hosts a podcast connected to the charity. Then, last Thursday, it was revealed the charity had paid Mr. Trudeau’s mother and brother a total of $207,000, about 282,000 Canadian dollars, for speaking engagements. The country’s ethics commissioner has already launched an investigation into the affair, marking the third time the prime minister has been investigated for breaking conflict-of-interest rules since coming to power in 2015 on a promise of openness and transparency. Both previous times, he was found in breach of the rules, which badly damaged his brand. His Liberal Party only narrowly won re-election last year. “The question is, ‘Does the scandal go away, or does it continue?’” said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian nonprofit polling firm based in Vancouver. “A lot of that is out of his control. It’s down to what the opposition parties do.” She noted that the prime minister’s approval rating, which has soared over the past four months because of his perceived deft handling of the coronavirus, had dropped to 50 percent according to data her firm released Monday. So far, the scandal has not shown signs of abating, as revelations have arisen about other people in Mr. Trudeau’s inner circle with personal connections to the charity. Finance Minister Bill Morneau, whose daughter works in the charity’s travel department, also apologized on Monday. “I did not recuse myself from the discussions on this topic and, given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict,” he said in a Twitter post. Craig and Marc Kielburger, who founded the WE Charity together, took out a full-page ad in The Globe and Mail, a national newspaper, on Monday stating they “had made mistake that we sincerely regret” and that the last two weeks had led them to “more closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization.” The charity said it would waive all the administrative costs incurred in setting up the program and would return government funds already received. The charity had been slated to receive a total of $14 million for overseeing the program. Mr. Trudeau has developed a reputation in Canada for delivering contrite apologies, both for historical government transgressions and for his own personal mistakes, including going to parties in blackface and brownface as a student and young teacher. At Monday’s news conference, Mr. Trudeau said he was most sorry students would not get access as quickly to the aid program, established to award some students up to 5,000 Canadian dollars in grants for doing volunteer work. The government took over the program after the scandal surfaced. With no election on the horizon, it’s unlikely the scandal will deeply damage Mr. Trudeau, said Lori Turnbull, director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “It’s not a terribly damning apology. It’s quite clever. He’s not saying the decision was wrong, he’s saying he shouldn’t have been at the table for it,” she said. “I think this is very, very low risk for him.”']",Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada apologized for failing to recuse himself in the awarding of a government contract to a charity with deep connections to his family.
"Monsoon Rains Pummel South Asia, Displacing Millions",2020-07-15,By Sameer Yasir,"['When heavy floods started inundating her riverside home last week in the village of Madarganj, northern Bangladesh, Habiba Begum chose to stay put with her family instead of moving to shelter. Ms. Begum’s family, desperate to save what few possessions they had, chained their only suitcase to their house, a makeshift structure of bamboo and banana leaves constructed after the last devastating flood in the area, just two years ago. As the waters rose, the house was marooned in muddied waters, and the family had to cook meals on a raised area of dry ground nearby. Then tragedy struck. Ms. Begum left her 1-year-old daughter, Lamia Khatun, on a patch of higher ground while she washed clothes in floodwaters on Tuesday. But the waters kept rising. “When I came back, she was gone,” Ms. Begum, 32, said. “We found her body hours later.” Across southern Asia, more than four million people have been hit hard by monsoon floods that have destroyed homes and structures, drowned entire villages and forced people to crouch on rooftops hoping for rescue. The monsoon season — usually June to September — brings a torrent of heavy rain, a deluge that is crucial to South Asia’s agrarian economy. But in recent years, the monsoon season has increasingly brought cyclones and devastating floods, causing the internal displacement of millions of people in low-lying areas, particularly in Bangladesh. Scientists say global warming has played a role by affecting rainfall patterns across the subcontinent. Instead of more constant but less intense rains, warming has increased the frequency of extreme rains, which are more likely to cause flooding. Last year, at least 600 people were killed and more than 25 million affected by flooding because of the torrential monsoon rains in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Nepal, according to the United Nations. And in 2017, more than 1,000 people died in floods across South Asia. Rainfall has been heaviest this year in northeast India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal, according to the Southeast Asia Flash Flood Forecast System, which is affiliated with the United Nations. The Bangladeshi authorities say that the flooding started in late June, inundations are expected to continue this month, and more areas will be affected. Enamur Rahman, the Bangladeshi minister for disaster management, said the inundations were the worst in decades and that hundreds of thousands of families had been marooned, forcing the authorities to open more than a thousand emergency shelters. “We are fighting the catastrophe with every possible resource available,” Mr. Rahman said. “It seems rains and floods will be prolonged this year.” Researchers have warned that within a few decades, Bangladesh, with a population of more than 160 million people, may lose more than 10 percent of its land to sea-level rise, caused by a warming climate, displacing as many as 18 million. India has also suffered immensely. Floods have swept across the states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and other areas in the eastern part of the country. The authorities in the country have said that at least 85 people have died, with more than three million affected by the deluge. In the northeastern state of Assam, Kaziranga National Park, a World Heritage site that is a home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, a species listed as vulnerable by the WWF, has been completely inundated. Officials said that more than 50 animals had died in the flooding, though some wildlife had been rescued. With more than a dozen rivers and tributaries swelling above the danger mark, rescue operations have been carried out in at least 22 districts across Assam. In Nepal, 67 people have died and 40 others are missing, according to the National Emergency Operation Center. That is in additional to the monsoons that have battered Bangladesh. Low-lying and densely populated, the country is chronically ravaged by flooding. In Jamalpur, in the north, the flood situation has become critical, with rivers flowing well above the danger level. Muneeb-ul-Islam, 42, who lives in the area with his wife and three children, said he had lost his home several times in 10 years, leaving him with nothing but the clothes he was wearing. Mr. ul-Islam and his family are among more than a million people in Bangladesh left displaced or homeless by the floods. “It is as if we have committed some sin,” Mr. ul-Islam said. “This is the third time in the last few years that we will have to rebuild our lives from scratch.” Ms. Begum, who lost her 1-year-old, said her life had been completely destroyed. She has now moved to a nearby shelter, a school building, where hundreds of people were crammed in. Fear of the coronavirus spreading in such cramped quarters looms large. Ms. Begum’s family said there had not been enough warning about the magnitude of the flooding. “I will never go back to the place where we used to live,” she said, “The water has snatched everything from us.”']","Flooding in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Nepal has killed scores of people, destroyed homes and structures, drowned entire villages, and forced many to crouch on rooftops hoping for rescue."
Strains Show in Russia’s Make-Believe Politics,2020-07-14,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, Russia’s septuagenarian nationalist firebrand, long functioned as a safety valve for public discontent, corralling protest votes but then supporting President Vladimir V. Putin at key junctures. Now, he says, the Kremlin treats his party “like idiots.” “Go out on the field and play,” he says his party is told, “but don’t score any goals.” Outrage over last week’s arrest of Sergei I. Furgal, a popular governor and a member of Mr. Zhirinovsky’s party, has jolted the Kremlin’s carefully calibrated system of make-believe opposition politics. Street protests in support of the governor continued for a fourth straight day in the Khabarovsk region on Russia’s Pacific coast, the latest sign that Mr. Putin faces a domestic political landscape growing ever more volatile. “Society is becoming uncontrollable,” said Yury Korgunyuk, a political scientist at the Russian Academy of Sciences. “The old instruments don’t work anymore.” Among the Kremlin’s longstanding instruments for channeling discontent are “systemic opposition” parties, the most prominent of which are the Communists and Mr. Zhirinovsky’s nationalists. But the popular anger in Khabarovsk over Mr. Furgal’s arrest threatens to jump the guardrails of the Kremlin’s curated multiparty system. The Communists and nationalists criticize Mr. Putin on occasion, then lose to him in landslides in presidential elections — Mr. Zhirinovsky, personally, three times. Things play out similarly on the regional level, where Communist and nationalist candidates often split the opposition vote and deliver victory to the ruling United Russia party. That was supposed to be Mr. Furgal’s role as well when the former scrap metal trader ran for governor of the sprawling Khabarovsk region in 2018. But in a shock to Moscow, he rode a wave of anti-elite sentiment and won in 2018, setting off immediate speculation over how and when the Kremlin would co-opt or remove him. It finally happened last Thursday, when a squad of camouflaged security forces pulled him out of the back seat of a Lexus S.U.V. and put him on an eight-hour commercial flight to Moscow. He was accused of involvement in multiple murders in the early 2000s. Disgruntled Khabarovsk residents saw the arrest as a transparent attempt to rob them of their democratic choice, and they rallied by the tens of thousands on Saturday, the biggest protests that the region had seen since the early 1990s. “He was the only governor who, after many years, started to bring the region up from its knees,” Olesya Usoltseva-Zimina, a 41-year-old census specialist who plans to demonstrate for Mr. Furgal again this coming Saturday, said by phone from Khabarovsk. “He clearly wasn’t acceptable to the Kremlin.” In a leaked recording of a phone call last year, Mr. Putin’s representative to Russia’s Far East could be heard complaining to Mr. Furgal that the governor’s approval rating in his region was rising while the president’s was falling. Mr. Furgal’s supporters say the last straw came earlier this month, when Khabarovsk recorded only 44 percent turnout in the nationwide vote on constitutional amendments that allow Mr. Putin to serve until 2036. “I think many people would allow that he may have been involved in some not-so-honest things,” another protester, Sergei Mamayev, a 33-year-old event organizer, said of the governor. “But despite all this, we want our choice to be respected.” The outpouring of anger has put Mr. Zhirinovsky in a bind: stirring the pot too much would irk Mr. Putin and threaten the financial spoils of his political perch. So far he has split the difference: He delivered a rousing defense of Mr. Furgal in Parliament, accusing Mr. Putin of creeping, Stalin-like repressions; but he also warned supporters that participating in unsanctioned street protests would have “only negative consequences.” “It’s a situation in which he can’t not be in the opposition, but being in the opposition is dangerous,” Mr. Korgunyuk, the political scientist, said. “Zhirinovsky sees his party first and foremost as a business, so it is hard for him to break with the authorities.” The risk for Mr. Zhirinovsky and for the Kremlin is that discontent over Mr. Furgal’s arrest could benefit more uncompromising opposition politicians, such as Aleksei A. Navalny. Mr. Navalny’s populist, at times nationalist, message taps into a similar vein of public discontent as Mr. Zhirinovsky’s. His branch office in the city of Khabarovsk has been a driving force behind smaller-scale street protests that have continued there this week. “They should be tougher in pushing for their interests,” Ms. Usoltseva-Zimina said of Mr. Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party. “He needs to somehow take his work as a political leader more seriously.” Mr. Zhirinovsky, in an interview Tuesday with The New York Times, acknowledged that he could lose support. He said that after Mr. Furgal took office, Mr. Putin’s administration had tried to get the new governor to quit Mr. Zhirinovsky’s party. “This is horrific,” Mr. Zhirinovsky said. “Who will root for a team that always loses?” Mr. Zhirinovsky — known for racist and misogynist outbursts and calls for Russia to occupy foreign territory — has been a fixture in the country’s politics since the early 1990s. He backed Mr. Putin’s recent constitutional amendments and has dropped hints that Mr. Putin could become Russia’s leader for life. But in the interview Tuesday, Mr. Zhirinovsky signaled he was prepared to embrace Russians’ fatigue with their president, whose current term ends in 2024. Analysts say that the pandemic helped drive Mr. Putin’s approval rating to a 20-year low of 59 percent this spring. “There will definitely be a new president — either in 2024, or maybe earlier, or in 2028 or in 2030,” Mr. Zhirinovsky said. “Khabarovsk showed that one can’t do anything by force today, that one can’t falsify elections today.” Russia’s managed multiparty system has worked for the Kremlin because it splinters the anti-Putin vote. But the protests in Khabarovsk show the potential for discontent to unite disparate groups. Saturday’s rally drew longtime Putin critics like Vitaly Blazhevich, 56, who teaches Russian at a university across the border in China and says he finds Mr. Zhirinovsky’s rhetoric “absolutely unacceptable.” “Furgal is, of course, no Václav Havel,” Mr. Blazhevich said, referring to the Czech dissident and anti-Communist leader. “But where will we get a Václav Havel? If the people chant, ‘Putin resign!’ then I’m with my people.” Oleg Matsnev contributed research.']","The nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky has been forced to disavow protests over the arrest of a governor from his own party, underscoring growing domestic volatility."
Burning Ships in Iran Add to String of Dozens of Explosions and Fires,2020-07-15,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['A large fire broke out at a shipyard in the southern Iranian port city of Bushehr on Wednesday, burning seven ships and sending plumes of black smoke billowing above the city skyline, according to videos and Iranian media reports. The fire followed dozens of recent fires and explosions across Iran’s forests, factories and military and nuclear facilities in the past three months that have rattled ordinary Iranians. Iranian officials have said that some of the episodes may have been acts of sabotage but blamed weather, accidents and equipment malfunctions for the others. On Tuesday an aluminum factory in the industrial city of Lamard, in Fars Province, caught fire. On Sunday, a fire broke out at petrochemical plant in Khuzestan Province. An explosion at the country’s top nuclear facility in Natanz two weeks ago damaged the structure where centrifuges were assembled and has been attributed to Israeli sabotage. There have also been explosions at two power plants, a chlorine gas leak at a chemical plant and an explosion at a missile production factory at a military complex in Tehran. Some Iranian officials have said privately that they suspect that at least some of the fires and explosions were part of an American and Israeli military campaign against Iran, but no official has publicly said whether any of the incidents are linked or blamed any country or group for them. Some analysts speculate that various enemies of the Iranian government — not just the United States and Israel but possibly domestic groups as well — may be seizing the opportunity to stoke chaos. “There is a belief that those who want regime change in Iran are throwing everything they have at Iran to see which one would stick,” said Foad Izadi, a conservative political analyst in Tehran. The waves of explosions and fires, he said, are “creating this sense of instability and chaos and insecurity.” No casualties were reported from the shipyard fire on Wednesday. Local officials said the flames were so extensive that they had to call in additional fire engines from the navy, the Revolutionary Guards Corp and a nearby nuclear plant. The fire was tamed after about five hours, local media reported. Jahangir Dehghan, Bushehr’s top crisis official, said the cause of the fire was unclear but that high winds and the fiberglass used in boat construction had contributed to its rapid spread, according to the Tasnim news agency. Fiberglass, however, is not generally flammable. While government officials have not linked the fires and explosions, they have acknowledged that the number and frequency are unusual. Aside from military and industrial fires, more than 1,100 forest fires in the past three months have burned more than 150 square miles of woodlands. Parliament called in the ministers of environment and intelligence to question them about the forest fires, at least a fifth of which were believed to been caused by arson. Many Iranians and some officials suspect that the fires and explosions are part of a coordinated covert operation by the United States and Israel to pressure the Islamic Republic government to negotiate a new nuclear deal, or to provoke a military confrontation. The July 2 explosion at Natanz was part of a yearlong covert operation by Israel and the United States, American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials have said. Intelligence officials said the blast may have set the Iranian nuclear program back as much as two years. Israel and the United States have sabotaged Iran’s nuclear program in the past. But officials from both countries said they had nothing to do with the explosion at a missile production facility near Tehran in late June. But there have been so many things burning or blowing up that Iranians are suspicious of everything. “Nobody believes these incidents are an accident even if they really are accidents,” said Abbas Abdi, a reformist analyst in Tehran. He said he thought the aim of these attacks was to project the sense that Iran’s government was losing control and to encourage opposition supporters inside Iran to rise up. For many Iranians, anticipating what will blow up next has become a kind of parlor game. Majid, a 63-year-old business owner in Tehran’s bazaar who asked that his last name not be used, said morning greetings with fellow shopkeepers are followed by speculation about what will explode or burn that day. Hossein, a writer in Tehran who also asked his last name not be used, said that when he took a taxi last week, the driver quizzed the passengers about which sites had exploded and which they predicted would be next. In the absence of a clear culprit or claim of responsibility, the government has been struggling to respond. Analysts said some of the episodes had clearly demonstrated that there were security gaps and intelligence moles within Iran’s most secure nuclear and military sites as well as industrial complexes. Not responding to sabotage risks appearing weak and vulnerable, while retaliating could set off a military confrontation that could be costly and painful. Some officials also fear that a war could improve President Trump’s re-election prospects. Hence the government has said little about the fires and explosions that have damaged a military base in Birjand, the state broadcasting headquarters in Tehran, a port near Bandarlengeh, a steel plant in Ahwaz and a petrochemical plant in Mahshahrtaken, to name a few episodes that took place over just five days last month. Instead, the government is embracing what one official calls “strategic patience.” “Iran is neither prepared nor wants a war,” Mr. Abdi said. “The reason it won’t even acknowledge publicly that they are sabotage is to save face and not be cornered into a response.” But if the attacks escalate, analysts said, a military response would be inevitable.']","Iranian officials say that some of the explosions at factories and military facilities, and some forest fires, may have been sabotage but blamed weather and accidents for the others."
"After Months of Debate, England Requires Face Masks for Shoppers",2020-07-14,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Britons, a people famously averse to seeming ruffled in times of distress, have taken slowly, if at all, to face masks during the coronavirus pandemic. Jim Williams says people in his home city, Newcastle, have even yelled at him and shot him angry looks when he wore one. “Brits would rather be sick than embarrassed,” said Mr. Williams, 31, adding that his own family had turned down masks he bought for them. “We’re all very concerned with doing what other people are doing, and not wanting to be seen as being hysterical or ridiculous.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson, rushing to reopen the hardest-hit country in Europe, weighed in on Tuesday on the side of embarrassment rather than sickness: He mandated that people wear masks inside shops and supermarkets in England, putting an end to months of equivocation on the matter. Many scientists have found the dithering over face coverings mystifying and uneasily reminiscent of Britain’s delay in imposing a lockdown in March, part of a laissez-faire approach to the pandemic that has drawn intense criticism. In March, Mr. Johnson proclaimed Britain “a land of liberty” as he resisted following countries across Europe into lockdown. He, himself, later became seriously ill with the virus. Britain now has the third-highest death toll in the world from Covid-19 — more than 50,000 by one official tally, and about 45,000 by another — behind only the United States and Brazil. Scientists say the Conservative government’s slow reactions have cost thousands of lives. The reversal over face masks, set to take effect on July 24, pulls England into line with other European countries, like Germany, Italy and Spain — France plans to make them mandatory in enclosed spaces on Aug. 1 — and with Scotland, which is part of Britain but sets its own health policy. About half of U.S. states require masks in some public spaces, but the rules vary widely. Britain has largely avoided the partisan debate over masks that has engulfed the United States. Instead, the government’s hesitation to mandate them has stemmed from internal debates among scientific advisers about the masks’ usefulness, and an apparent concern about ensuring that a resource in short supply was used where it was needed most. But there were hints on Tuesday of an American-style divide on the matter. In an almost empty House of Commons, the Conservative lawmaker Desmond Swayne railed on Tuesday against what he called “this monstrous imposition against myself and a number of outraged and reluctant constituents.” “Nothing,” he said, “would make me less likely to go shopping than the thought of having to mask up.” The police also bristled at being asked to enforce the new rules by levying fines of up to 100 pounds, or $125, with an officers’ union calling it “unrealistic and unfair” to expect them to patrol shop aisles. For shops that had already told customers to wear masks, the requirement came as a relief. Just as the government’s slowness in imposing a lockdown in March had forced decisions about closures onto individual citizens and shopkeepers, so too had its reluctance to make a rule about face masks left people and businesses struggling to chart their own paths. “Obviously, the pandemic isn’t over, and we only really wanted to open if we could keep everyone as safe as possible,” said Gayle Lazda, a bookseller at the London Review Bookshop in central London, which has required masks since it reopened this month. “Just like before the lockdown happened, we closed the shop because it seemed like the only sensible thing to do.” Some scientists had pleaded for months with Mr. Johnson’s government to heed the growing evidence that masks could help stop the spread of the virus. But the government resisted, with England’s deputy chief medical officer saying on April 3 that “there is no evidence that general wearing of face masks by the public who are well affects the spread of the disease in our society.” As recently as April 28, the government’s powerful Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies retroactively edited the minutes of a previous meeting to emphasize that “it would be unreasonable to claim a large benefit from wearing a mask.” The advisers’ misgivings reflected what critics called an overly rigid approach to the science. The advisers emphasized a lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials, a bar that outside scientists said was impossibly high to meet, especially given the difficulties of measuring how one person’s mask might protect untold others. “Some scientists feel that a very high level of certainty is required before advice is given for the public to undertake wearing a mask or other behaviors that would reduce disease transmission,” said Paul Edelstein, an emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who helped write an influential report to British scientific advisers encouraging face coverings this month. Masks have been mandatory on public transportation in England since mid-June, and the government had previously encouraged — but not required — masks in enclosed spaces. But the minutes of their meetings show that the government’s scientific advisers fretted about the possibility of masks making people more willing to leave home with symptoms, or to violate social distancing measures. Trisha Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care at the University of Oxford, published an analysis on April 9 asking the government to consider how little there was to lose, and how much to gain, from encouraging the widespread use of masks. She said in an interview that the issue required considering a wider range of evidence than some scientists were trained to trust, like studies of super-spreader events on cruise ships. “They’re creatures of their own upbringing,” she said of some of the government’s scientific advisers. “They have a lot of ingrained assumptions about what counts as rigor, and so then the science isn’t quite rigorous enough.” Britain was far from alone in distrusting masks. Not knowing the extent of symptomless transmission, scientists in the United States and with the World Health Organization were also slow to encourage their use, noted Venki Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, a scientific body in Britain. But Britons proved especially slow to voluntarily adopt masks, with only 21 percent of people saying they wore one in public, according to an analysis by YouGov published in June. That put Britain far behind almost all of Europe, Asia and the Americas. Even in France, which has not yet required masks in shops, 79 percent of people wore them, YouGov said. So did 69 percent of Americans. Beyond the discomfort, Britons complained in polls that they felt self-conscious, silly and embarrassed in masks. That reflected in part what Peter York, a prominent social commentator, described as a longstanding aversion — particularly among the upper classes — to seeming rattled in the face of disease or distress. “There’s a class-based idea that anything too valetudinarian, too conspicuously hygienic, is middle-class,” he said, using a long word for being unduly anxious about one’s health. “It’s one of the sort of bravado things of the English upper class, that being madly hygienic is silly.” For Ayla Hogg, 22, who has been long been wearing a mask around her village in Scotland, the introduction of a countrywide mandate in recent days was a comfort after months of disconcerting reactions to her mask. “You have people purposely avoiding you, and you feel very self-conscious, like maybe I’m overreacting to this,” she said. “British people are incredibly awkward at the best of times. Going against the norm is very, very odd, and it does make you feel a bit like an outsider.” Aurelien Breeden and Emma Bubola contributed reporting.']","Many parts of Europe and the United States already require masks in stores, but in Britain the idea has come up against the twin fears of appearing either perturbed or ridiculous."
He Changed His Country’s Name. Will North Macedonia Punish Him?,2020-07-14,By Patrick Kingsley,"['SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Zoran Zaev, the front-runner in a general election on Wednesday in North Macedonia, got more done during his 30 months as prime minister than most Macedonian politicians did in the nearly 30 years since the country won independence from Yugoslavia. When Mr. Zaev resigned from the premiership in January, to allow a caretaker government to oversee the election campaign, he had brought North Macedonia to the brink of NATO membership. He had cleared the way for the country to apply to join the European Union. And he had resolved a three-decade-old dispute with the country’s largest neighbor, Greece. And yet Mr. Zaev could still lose Wednesday’s election, partly thanks to anger at the measure he took to achieve all this: the addition of the qualifier “North” to the country’s old name of Macedonia. That move persuaded Greece to stop blocking the country’s applications to join NATO and the European Union, now confident that Skopje had no territorial ambitions over an area of northern Greece also known as Macedonia. But it enraged Macedonians who felt that Mr. Zaev had eroded their identity, and who resented how he ratified the amendment in Parliament despite most voters boycotting a referendum on the subject. “I come from Macedonia, not North Macedonia,” said Robert Mileski, a blogger and software developer who voted for Mr. Zaev in the last election but now describes that decision as “the biggest mistake in my life.” “He doesn’t have the right to put his own will before the will of the people,” Mr. Mileski added. A loss on Wednesday for Mr. Zaev’s center-left party would spell uncertainty not only for North Macedonia, a landlocked and mountainous country of 2 million, but for the wider region of southeastern Europe, where several of the issues underpinning the Balkan Wars of the 1990s remain unresolved two decades later. Mr. Zaev’s biggest rival, Hristijan Mickoski, a right-wing nationalist, opposed the name change. Mr. Mickoski also wants to revisit parts of not only the agreement with Greece but also a similar pact with Bulgaria and a recent law that increased rights for ethnic Albanians, who form around a quarter of North Macedonia’s population. “If we are not stable,” Mr. Zaev said in an interview last week, “if we are fighting with our neighbors, if we are fighting with the Albanians inside North Macedonia, it puts the country completely in danger.” In a separate interview, Mr. Mickoski said he supported the country’s NATO membership and application to join the European Union. But he also promised to work within constitutional limits to alter the pact with Greece. “He can’t ignore the reality,” Mr. Mickoski said, talking about himself in the third person. “But at the same time, he will use all democratic tools to change that reality.” If Mr. Mickoski does win power, few expect him to formally reverse the agreement with Greece. But some analysts fear he would create enough turbulence with Greece and Bulgaria that one or both might renew their opposition to North Macedonia’s E.U. application, diverting the energy and attention of international mediators from other regional tensions. In particular, that would distract from efforts to broker a final settlement between Serbia and Kosovo, the former Serbian province that broke away in 1999 following a guerrilla campaign by ethnic Albanian separatists and a NATO bombing campaign that aimed to protect its largely Albanian population from ethnic cleansing. “I do think it will be a problem for the region,” said Petar Arsovski, a Skopje-based political analyst. “We’re not over the hill yet. We can still roll back down.” Like the rest of the Balkans, North Macedonia is a field of competition for the West, Russia and China. Any deviation from a pro-European path could give Moscow a chance to reimpose itself, particularly with European powers divided about how much they want to engage with North Macedonia. Even after Mr. Zaev staked his political career on the name change, France briefly blocked the country from applying to join the European Union — only relenting after Mr. Zaev resigned in despair and called for new elections. A loss for Mr. Zaev might also exacerbate internal tensions between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians, some of whom led a failed separatist uprising in 2001. In this election, Mr. Zaev’s party is running on a slate with an ethnic Albanian party — a rare partnership in a country where parties tend to divide along ethnic lines. Mr. Zaev has also attempted to bridge the divide between the two communities by introducing a law that gave ethnic Albanians the right to speak their language within state institutions and installed Albanian signage in settlements with significant Albanian populations. Mr. Mickoski wants to revisit that law, a move many Albanians say would be a provocation, particularly if it came in tandem with any challenges to European integration. “Albanians are more Western-orientated, so shifting from that road will create an internal split,” said Albert Musliu, an ethnic Albanian political analyst and rights activist. “Every stepping back from E.U. integration creates a tension between the two communities.” Rights activists and business leaders alike are also concerned about what a loss for Mr. Zaev would mean for the rule of law. Mr. Zaev entered office in 2017 after Mr. Mickoski’s party, which had been in power for 11 years, was toppled by a series of scandals related to graft and government surveillance. The State Department concluded in 2015 that Mr. Mickoski’s predecessor, Nikola Gruevski, had overseen high levels of corruption, did not fully respect the rule of law, tried to restrict media freedom and meddled in judicial decisions. Under Mr. Zaev, North Macedonia began tentative legal reforms and became slightly more democratic, according to an assessment by Freedom House, an independent Washington-based rights watchdog. Coupled with a stronger international profile, this has made North Macedonia a more appealing place to do business. Since the pact with Greece was signed in 2018, the number of companies working in the country’s free economic zones has more than doubled to 40. Some fear a change of government would slow this investment. “Everyone is looking for the rule of law and the stabilization of Macedonia,” said Goran Maurovski, the head of Beton, a major construction firm. But Mr. Zaev’s critics say he is himself willing to bend the rule of law when it suits his agenda. To secure the support of eight opposition lawmakers needed to ratify the name deal through Parliament, Mr. Zaev controversially agreed to support an amnesty for lawmakers or their relatives who were under investigation over cases including a 2017 attack on the Parliament building. “Is that democratic?” said Mr. Mileski, the blogger who once supported Mr. Zaev. “Either you are a democrat or you are not.” This kind of frustration, combined with outrage at the name deal, will be Mr. Zaev’s greatest obstacle to re-election on Wednesday. At a rally for Mr. Mickoski, Vijana Milosevska, a 31-year-old salesperson, said she hoped Mr. Zaev would lose so that the country’s name could be changed back to Macedonia. “It’s not important for us to enter the E.U. — we can survive by ourselves on our own land,” Ms. Milosevska said. “If the Russians give us a better offer,” she added, “why not?” Alisa Dogramadzieva contributed reporting from Skopje.']",Zoran Zaev led North Macedonia into NATO and toward the European Union by altering its name. That could cost him in an election on Wednesday.
"How Russia Built a Channel to the Taliban, Once an Enemy",2020-07-13,By Mujib Mashal and Michael Schwirtz,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — During one of the most violent stretches of fighting in northern Afghanistan, as the Taliban scored victories that had eluded them since the beginning of the conflict, the top American commander went public with a suspicion that had nagged for years: Russia was aiding the insurgents. In diplomatic circles in Kabul around the time of that accusation, in 2017, there were murmurs that the Russian assistance had included night-vision goggles and armor-piercing ammunition. But Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander, offered no definitive evidence, and that spoke to how confusing the battlefield had become as three longtime adversaries — the Taliban, Russia and Iran — agreed on their common interest in seeing the Americans leave Afghanistan. In the maze of corruption, cash and foreign hands in Afghanistan, it was no easy task to pin down who was doing what. “We’ve had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and said, ‘This was given by the Russians to the Taliban,’” General Nicholson said a year later. “We know that the Russians are involved.” The recent revelation of an American intelligence assessment that Russia had provided the Taliban with bounties to attack U.S. and coalition troops stunned political leaders in Washington and added a potent dose of Cold War-style skulduggery to deliberations over Afghanistan’s future. Both Russia and the Taliban have rejected the assertion. But while that would be a notable escalation of Russian interference in Afghanistan, it was clear to many officials that Russia had been working to hedge its bets with the Taliban for years. The Russians saw the Afghan government as entirely controlled by the United States, and at worst so fragile that it would struggle to survive the U.S. withdrawal. In interviews, Afghan and American officials and foreign diplomats with years of experience in Kabul say that what began as a diplomatic channel between Russia and the Taliban just under a decade ago has more recently blossomed into a mutually beneficial alliance that has allowed the Kremlin to reassert its influence in the region. The shift coincided with increasing hostility between the United States and Russia over Syria’s civil war and other conflicts, analysts say, as well as Russia’s frustration with rising instability in Afghanistan and the slow pace of the U.S. pullout. Now, the United States is conducting the troop withdrawal it agreed to with the Taliban even without a final peace deal between the insurgents and the Afghan government which the Americans have supported for years. But Russia’s covert efforts, officials and analysts say, are aimed at harassing and embarrassing the United States as the troops leave rather than profoundly changing the course of the conflict. “It was in modest quantities; it was not designed to be a game-changer on the battlefield,” General Nicholson, who has since retired from the military, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday about Russian arms and aid to the Taliban. “For example, the Taliban wanted surface-to-air missiles, the Russians didn’t give it to them. So I always concluded that their support to the Taliban was calibrated in some sense.” Some pointed out the considerably more extensive American efforts to support the mujahedeen insurgency against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. “We did the same,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former C.I.A. field officer in Afghanistan who retired last year as the agency’s acting chief of operations in Europe and Eurasia. “We turned the heat up as the Russians were leaving Afghanistan.” “Putin,” he said, “is a student of history.” As things began turning on the battlefield in recent years, officials described increasing suspicions of a greater Russian role in helping the Taliban. But they often struggled to pin down specifics, other than occasional influxes of new weapons and munitions that could have had several sources. In addition to Pakistan’s well-established support to the Taliban, Iran was taking a greater hand in helping the insurgents, and often using similar channels as the Russians, Afghan intelligence officials say. The dots began connecting more clearly during a stretch of alarming violence in northern Afghanistan, when the Taliban twice overran Kunduz city, a provincial capital, in 2015 and 2016, sending the U.S. military scrambling.  As Afghan intelligence narrowed in on the ambitious regional Taliban commander behind those assaults, they tracked his travel back and forth across the nearby border with Tajikistan, a Russian intelligence stronghold, according to current and former senior Afghan security officials. Kunduz is also the base of operations for two Afghan businessmen who American intelligence officials say acted as middlemen in the bounty scheme between Russian intelligence officers and Taliban fighters. U.S. officials say they confronted Russia about its aid to the Taliban on several occasions, but their public claims lacked detail, and it never amounted to a major issue. Russian officials said they received no documented evidence. Three decades after the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia’s cultural, economic and personal ties in the country remain deep. When Russia has looked to exert influence, whether benign or otherwise, it has had a host of friends to call on: Soviet-trained generals who led the Afghan forces for years on American pay; businessmen who bragged of friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia; politicians who kept homes in Moscow even as they grew rich on American contracts. For much of the first decade of the war, the United States did not really have to worry about the deep Russian reach into Afghan society, as Mr. Putin’s government was aligned with the American mission of defeating Al Qaeda and Islamist groups that Moscow also saw as a threat — including the Taliban. Diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks show genuine attempts by both sides to coordinate efforts in Afghanistan. Russian officials spoke of a “collective fist” in the fight against terrorism, and urged unity “with one voice — the American voice.” But as the war in Afghanistan dragged on, and the two powers took opposing sides in the crises in Syria and Ukraine, the Russians increasingly saw the U.S. mission as failed, and the American presence in the region as a threat. American intelligence officials now date Russia’s discreet outreach to the Taliban as beginning about eight years ago — around the time that Mr. Putin, after a four-year hiatus as prime minister, reassumed the presidency with a more confrontational posture with the West. The mistrust soon became intense enough that Russian officials accused the United States of playing a hand in the rise of an Islamic State chapter in Afghanistan around 2015, with many of its earliest fighters being extremist militants from Central Asia who yearned to bring a holy war against Russia. At a meeting of the Russian Security Council in 2013, Mr. Putin said his country could no longer stand by in the face of failures by the United States and its partners. “We need a clear action strategy, which will take into account different possible developments,” Mr. Putin said at the meeting. “The task is to reliably protect the interests of Russia under any circumstances.” Leading the portfolio on the diplomatic front was Zamir Kabulov, a veteran of the Soviet war in Afghanistan and reportedly a former Russian intelligence operative.  Mr. Kabulov began publicly criticizing the United States for weaknesses in the Afghan government and for failing to rein in Islamist militancy there — and increasingly describing the Afghan Taliban as a national entity that posed no threat beyond the country’s borders and could be worked with. Reports increased about Taliban figures making trips to Russia. And just as the United States and Taliban were finalizing details of the American withdrawal, Russia brought the same Taliban leaders into Moscow meetings with a large number of Afghan political figures for discussions over the political future of the country. As the United States has drawn down its military presence, it has increasingly relied on Afghan partners for intelligence and counterintelligence. What Afghan security officials were seeing in recent years, particularly in the north, was a deeply messy reality. Around the time they began focusing more on Russian activities, the Afghans also unraveled an Iranian scheme of distributing arms to discontented warlords and militia commanders — the weapons were Russian, and the route was through Tajikistan, officials said. The Iranian scheme was short-lived, one senior Afghan official said, after Iran realized the weapons it was providing were turning up in the saturated black market. The Russians often used the hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel imports for NATO and Afghan forces as a way to inject cash into Afghanistan to ensure influence and keep intelligence assets on their side. One former senior Afghan official said that instead of direct cash transfers, the Russians would mostly arrange for the convoys of oil tankers snaking into Afghanistan to be topped with extra fuel that would be cashed for circulation inside the country. Though the countries of Central Asia gained their independence after the Soviet collapse, Russia has never let go of its foothold in the region. In one cable, a Russian diplomat described the borders of countries like Tajikistan, where the Russian Air Force still has about 7,000 troops, as “an extension of its own border.” When the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan in 1990s, Tajikistan was a hub for the resistance commanders who received aid from Russia and Iran. In the 20 years since the U.S. invasion, the country has become a center of criminal traffic and vice, a kind of adult playground for many of the Afghan elite who frequently travel back and forth to Tajikistan and often have family there. In that mix of spies, money and mafia, the Taliban, too, found a foothold. The insurgents made a point of taking and maintaining control of some of the border crossings from Kunduz Province into Tajikistan. From the south of the country all the way to the north, they had border access to evade military pressure, maintain ties with friendly foreigners and keep a channel for the opium trade that partly finances the insurgency. Several Afghan officials, including Asadullah Omarkhel, who was the governor of Kunduz at the time, said they shared with the Americans intelligence that Mullah Abdul Salam, the Taliban commander who led the assaults on Kunduz, repeatedly crossed into Tajikistan for what they suspected were discussions with Russian agents. A Tajik news outlet reported meetings between Russian officials and Taliban commanders at a Russian air base in Tajikistan as early as 2015. And it was these border crossings that the Taliban used to bring weapons in, officials say. Mr. Omarkhel said Americans initially were not confident about claims of Taliban ties to Russia, but then they started striking the Taliban bases along the border, including a strike that killed Mullah Salam. At Thursday’s congressional hearing, General Nicholson repeated his accusation of Russia arming the Taliban, noting that even though the aid was not extensive, it still had effect. “In the northern part of Afghanistan, in particular in Kunduz, the Russian assistance did help the Taliban inflict higher casualties on the Afghan security forces and more hardship on the Afghan people,” he said. Najim Rahim, Eric Schmitt and Taimoor Shah contributed reporting.']","The recent assessment that Russia paid bounties to the insurgents to attack U.S. troops stunned many, but officials said the Kremlin’s outreach began almost a decade ago."
"World Population Could Peak Decades Ahead of U.N. Forecast, Study Asserts",2020-07-14,By Rick Gladstone,"['United Nations demographers have been anticipating since last year that the world’s population may stop growing by 2100 as fertility rates decline, projecting a peak of 10.9 billion people by century’s end, compared with roughly 7.8 billion now. But a study published on Tuesday in The Lancet, the medical journal, has challenged that forecast, with major economic and political implications. The study asserted that the global population could peak at 9.7 billion by 2064 — nearly four decades earlier — and decline to 8.8 billion by 2100. Moreover, the study concluded, the elderly will make up a bigger chunk of the total than foreseen in the U.N. forecast, and the populations of at least 23 countries, including Japan, Thailand, Italy and Spain, could shrink by more than 50 percent. The study also projected significant declines in the working-age populations of China and India, the two most populous countries, portending a weakening in their global economic power. The study’s projections, if borne out, also carry significant consequences for the United States, whose economy is expected to trail China’s in size by 2035. As China’s working-age population declines in the second half of the century, the study said, the United States could reclaim the top spot economically by 2098 — if immigration continues to replenish the American work force. “Continued global population growth through the century is no longer the most likely trajectory for the world’s population,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine, who led the study. Dr. Murray said the study “provides governments of all countries an opportunity to start rethinking their policies on migration, work forces and economic development to address the challenges presented by demographic change.” An important underlying reason behind the conclusions is the improvement in access to modern contraception and the education of girls and women, which the study said would “hasten declines in fertility and slow population growth.” While the most recent United Nations population forecast, made in June 2019, also noted declining fertility, the new study said the consequences would be felt much sooner and with greater impact. John Wilmoth, director of the population division in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which produces the organization’s projections every two years, said Tuesday that he had not yet fully read the study. But he said that it had made some assumptions about fertility, mortality and migration that helped shape the conclusions. One of the biggest assumptions, he said in a phone interview, was that countries with low fertility rates would do nothing to raise them between now and 2100. “It’s kind of an extreme assumption to think that countries aren’t going to think their way out of the problem for the next 80 years,” he said. Mr. Wilmoth also said the United Nations had been tracking population trends for 70 years and that its projections “represent a consensus view” among demographers. Still, he said, “I welcome this sort of creative inquiry about other ways of seeing these things.” The forecasting methodology used in the study found that by 2100, 183 of 195 countries would have total fertility rates — the average number of children a woman delivers over her lifetime — below the replacement level of 2.1 births. That is the level needed to prevent population decline. The study also suggested that the decline could be offset by immigration, with countries that promote liberal immigration policies better able to maintain their population and support economic growth. Some countries with fertility rates lower than replacement level, such as the United States, Australia and Canada, would probably replenish their working-age populations through net immigration, the study said, although it noted uncertainty about such a forecast. The backlash in the United States against immigration, the study said, could threaten “the country’s potential to sustain population and economic growth.”']","The study, published in The Lancet, said an accelerated decline in fertility rates means the global population could peak in 2064 at 9.7 billion and fall to 8.8 billion by century’s end."
Coronavirus Outbreak at U.S. Bases in Japan Roils an Uneasy Relationship,2020-07-13,"By Motoko Rich, Makiko Inoue and Hikari Hida","['TOKYO — An outbreak of coronavirus cases on United States military bases in Okinawa, Japan, has alarmed the island’s local population, which at times has been at odds with the Americans stationed there and has otherwise been successful in limiting Covid-19. The U.S. Marine Corps, which has about 20,000 troops stationed on the island, reported 94 confirmed cases to the prefectural government and said it had instituted strict measures in all 33 installations in the region.  Denny Tamaki, the governor of Okinawa, said he was shocked by the number of infections and said it was “extremely regrettable” that so many cases had emerged among American troops and affiliated personnel in less than a week. Excluding the American cases, Okinawa has recorded just 148 infections since February. Mr. Tamaki added that he had “strong doubts” about the prevention measures reported by the United States. Japan, which has been relatively successful in containing the virus, has also experienced a recent surge of new cases concentrated in Tokyo, where a state of emergency was lifted at the end of May. Tokyo reported two consecutive days of record daily infections last week, with a large number of cases among people in their 20s and 30s who worked in or had visited venues in Tokyo’s nightlife districts. The United States military in South Korea also announced on Monday that 11 troops had tested positive upon arrival from the United States. The American military has struggled with outbreaks among its troops, with a major cluster of infections in March on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. The Japanese military, by contrast, has reported just 14 cases among its defense forces, all of whom are thought to have contracted the virus in their communities rather than while deployed.  The cases in Okinawa are a new strain on relations between the military and the local government, where the presence of American bases, dating to the end of World War II, has been an ongoing source of friction. Citizens have long complained of noise, crime and aircraft accidents, and have repeatedly questioned why nearly half of the 55,000 American troops in Japan — which include personnel from all of the military branches — are stationed on Okinawa. One of the bases where a number of the recent coronavirus cases have been recorded, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, is the subject of a contentious plan to relocate the base’s operations from central Okinawa to a less-populated coastal area where construction is underway. The Japanese central government considers the bases essential to the country’s security, and many citizens and businesses on Okinawa welcome the troops as customers and neighbors. When news of infections first started emerging from the bases, both the governor and the Okinawa prefectural assembly demanded more information from the Marine Corps about the number of cases, which troubled Okinawan officials and residents who feared they may have unknowingly come into contact with infected troops. “When anything like this happens, when the military doesn’t provide essential information of how many people are infected or where they are from or where they have been outside of the base, the Okinawan people are really scared and frustrated and disappointed,” said Manabu Sato, professor of political science at Okinawa International University, which overlooks the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. “I’m scared,” said Tomonari Kiyuna, a worker at a noodle shop in Chatan, a neighborhood on Okinawa frequented by American soldiers. “We’re very careful, wearing masks, washing hands, and sanitizing,” Mr. Kiyuna said. “I want them to disclose the information. They are Americans but they are staying in Okinawa, Japan. Okinawans or the Japanese people have the right to know” about infections stemming from the bases. Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said in a news conference that the government had “received the necessary information from the U.S.’s side, such as numbers of infected personnel and facilities affected.” Governor Tamaki said he was concerned that the soldiers had spread infections during celebrations on July 4. “There is information that the U.S. Forces personnel went out to the nightlife districts and had beach parties outside of the bases on July 4,” Mr. Tamaki said in a statement on Saturday. He requested that the military stop transferring new troops from the United States, where case numbers are surging. Under measures instituted over the weekend, all American troops and families on Okinawa are prohibited from leaving base without approval from commanders. They cannot visit restaurants, even for takeout, travel on public transit, use child-care facilities or exercise off base. Futenma and Camp Hansen, where the largest number of cases have been reported, are effectively on lockdown, American officials said. Throughout Japan, all troops and families arriving from the United States must quarantine for 14 days, said Col. Robert A. Firman, public affairs director for U.S. Forces Japan. “That measure will continue for the foreseeable future,” Colonel Firman said. “Installation commanders also have the discretion to increase protective measures based on local conditions, and that’s what we are seeing in Okinawa.” Colonel Firman said that military staff must also wear masks in most base facilities, implement social distancing and limit the size of any gatherings. Major Kenneth Kunze, a spokesman for the Marines on Okinawa, said that “thorough contact tracing is ongoing to identify and isolate those who may have come in contact with infected personnel. Anyone on or off base identified as having been in contact with an infected or suspected infected individual will be notified.” One of the largest hospitals on Okinawa, Chubu Hospital, has offered free testing to anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to the virus. So far, the hospital has tested 130 people since news of the base outbreaks. In a Facebook post, Yoshihiro Takayama, a doctor in the Infectious Disease and Public health department at Chubu Hospital, warned against blaming the military for the spread of the virus. “People tend to misunderstand that the U.S. service personnel spread the virus as many cases were found among them,” Dr. Takayama wrote. “But I don’t think so. It’s assumed that they were infected on July 4, judging from the confirmed date. But it’s still unknown from whom they got infected as epidemiological information is not shared. They could have been infected from contact with Japanese residents or among service personnel. It is supposed that there are multiple routes, but we should not have preconceptions.” He added that people had “visited many bars, danced in groups shoulder to shoulder and shared wine bottles,” including both American military personnel and local residents. In Chatan, where there are many bars frequented by the Americans, businesses noticed a downturn as the base lockdowns went into effect. “We saw a huge drop in customers yesterday, especially Americans,” said Itaru Maeshiro, owner of the Transit Cafe, where about a third of regular customers are American military personnel. At a sushi shop in Chatan, chef Kazuya Kaneshi said that the strict lockdown measures were tough for business. “But we don’t want infections at the same time,” he said. “If infections expand in the whole of Okinawa, it will be a huge problem.” Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.']","The Marines reported 94 new cases on Okinawa, an island that had seen just 148 other infections. Local officials say the military is not doing enough."
"Brexit Border Bureaucracy Looms for Truckers, Pet Owners and Travelers",2020-07-13,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — No more seamless access to medical care. A spike in cellphone bills. And months of preparation if you are bringing the dog. For Britons who have lapsed into complacency about crossing the English Channel in the four years since they voted for Brexit, the situation will soon get a lot more complicated. Up until now, the biggest problem they faced was driving on the wrong side of the road when reaching France. With Brexit grinding into its final phase, a government publicity drive is warning that Britons will lose health care rights in European Union countries and could pay roaming fees when using cellphones there. Perhaps as alarming for a nation of dog lovers, roaming freely will be harder for British pets. Owners must plan four months in advance to secure the paperwork to take them. Britain formally left the European Union in January but is honoring most of the bloc’s rules until a transition period ends in December. After that Britain will be outside the bloc’s economic structures and can proceed with plans to tighten immigration controls and strike trade agreements around the globe. But for travelers, and many businesses, the end of the transition period means more of one thing often regarded as a specialty of the European Union: bureaucracy. “For ordinary travelers it means getting ready for paying more and for more inconvenience,” said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London. “For business, the government is telling them to get ready for an enormous amount more paperwork.” Talks between Britain and the European Union over a trade deal are scheduled to continue on Wednesday. Despite new optimism around them, there is no sign of an immediate breakthrough. Even assuming Prime Minister Boris Johnson strikes an agreement with the bloc that guarantees no tariffs or quotas on trade, more controls on imports and exports are inevitable. That is the outcome of leaving the bloc’s single market and customs union — something Mr. Johnson has promised to do — a system that allows thousands of trucks to roll off ferries between Dover and Calais each day, mostly without stopping. According to British government estimates, the change of rules will require an additional 400 million customs declarations each year, adding a significant cost to businesses. The government has said it will spend more than 700 million British pounds — about $880 million — on infrastructure plans and will build around a dozen facilities near ports to process imports. If the technology works as planned, while trucks are crossing the Channel, their drivers will be instructed by text message whether they are required to stop at a special site either at a port or nearby. Others will be allowed to complete formalities at their destinations. “We are committed to working closely with businesses and the border industry to help deliver not just a fully operational border at the end of the transition period, but also the world’s most effective and secure border,” said Michael Gove, a senior Cabinet member with the title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. But he acknowledged that a new customs system will not be fully functioning until next July, so Britain will effectively wave many European trucks through ports for several months. That has provoked fears of a legal challenge under the rules of the World Trade Organization, according to a leaked internal letter from Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, with concerns that, under some circumstances, Britain could be deemed to be giving preferential treatment to E.U. imports by not subjecting them to the same conditions as, for example, American or Australian ones. The customs change poses big economic risks. One business lobbying organization, the Institute of Directors, surveyed 978 members and found less than a quarter were fully prepared. One in seven said they were distracted by the coronavirus crisis and almost one-third wanted the details of the new system to be clear before adjusting. “With so much going on, many directors feel that preparing for Brexit proper is like trying to hit a moving target. Jumping immediately into whatever comes next would be a nightmare for many businesses,” said Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors. Part of the problem is that Britain has been here before, having missed successive deadlines last year for its departure from the European Union. In 2019, some businesses prepared for a rupture only to find it unnecessary. So this time, the government needs to ensure that companies know change is coming, even before it is clear how much the disruption can be minimized. Travelers too need to know that the rights many have taken for granted, like working or retiring in continental Europe, are at an end. So the government campaign, with a slogan “The U.K.’s new start: let’s get going” is warning Britons, for example, that they will no longer be able to use a European pet passport system and will need different paperwork. Mr. Johnson, who was elected with the help of many voters in northern, working-class districts, is unlikely to fret about upsetting affluent, pro-European Britons who commute with their pets to vacation homes in rural France. On Monday the government also announced details of a new immigration system to be introduced next year, once Britain ends the free movement of European Union workers. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said the system would “attract the best and brightest from around the world,” but many low-paid workers will be excluded, which has alarmed several types of employers that rely on them, including nursing-care institutions. But the government hopes that such employers will have to increase wages to attract Britons to perform those jobs. That upward pressure on earnings could prove popular in economically disadvantaged parts of the country, which Mr. Johnson has promised to help by “leveling up” prosperity. So far, the prime minister has paid no political penalty for taking a hard line over Brexit, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, has not called for an extension of the transition period. If the disruption to trade and travel is severe, however, criticism is certain to grow. And the government has struggled to provide much evidence of the opportunities it promised would flow from leaving the European Union. “The change of tone was clear last year in the Conservative election campaign slogan,” said Mr. Menon. “Let’s ‘get Brexit done’ implied that this is something to get out of the way.”']",Next year businesses and travelers face mounds of new paperwork (and higher cellphone bills) as Britain builds up frontier controls.
Seoul Will Investigate #MeToo Accusations Against Dead Mayor,2020-07-15,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Seoul City Hall officials said on Wednesday that they would create a joint fact-finding team with women’s groups and legal and human rights experts to investigate accusations that Mayor Park Won-soon had sexually abused a secretary for four years. The team’s members \u200bwill \u200bhave no power to subpoena or indict those they want to \u200bquestion because Mr. Park, 64, killed himself on Thursday, a day after the secretary filed a complaint against him to the police. By law, the criminal case against Mr. Park was automatically closed upon his death. But women’s rights activists, as well as the unidentified secretary, who spoke to the news media through her lawyer, have called for an investigation even if prosecutors cannot bring charges against Mr. Park. In a survey conducted \u200bby Realmeter a \u200bday after Mr. Park’s funeral on Monday, more than 64 percent of respondents said they considered an investigation necessary, the company said on Wednesday. “The most important thing is to find the truth,” said Hwang In-sik, a spokesman for the city of Seoul, during a news conference on Wednesday, where he announced the fact-finding investigation. But Mr. Hwang indicated that the investigators might be able to ask City Hall for disciplinary actions or even \u200brequest that \u200bthe police begin a formal investigation if they find enough incriminating evidence against any \u200bCity Hall \u200bofficials other than Mr. Park. Besides the secretary’s allegations\u200b of sexual harassment\u200b, the investigators will look into when and through whom Mr. Park first learned of his secretary’s complaint to the police. Women’s rights activists have said that the filing was leaked to Mr. Park, giving him an opportunity to potentially destroy evidence before he died by suicide. They also said that the secretary’s initial appeals to city officials for help had been ignored as officials tried to protect Mr. Park’s reputation. \u200b “I am so crushed that I can hardly find a word to say to the people,” Lee Hae-chan, the head of the Democratic Party, said on Wednesday about the accusations against the late mayor. “I once again say we are sorry to the people.” The suicide of Mr. Park, as well as the accusations against him, have dominated news headlines in South Korea for several days. As mayor of Seoul, a city of 10 million, Mr. Park was South Korea’s second-most-powerful elected official, credited with making the city safer and more friendly toward women and often \u200bcited as a possible presidential candidate\u200b. \u200b Before becoming mayor, \u200bMr. Park had been one of the country’s most prominent human rights lawyer\u200bs\u200b, \u200bchampioning women’s rights throughout his career\u200b and winning the country’s first sexual harassment case. The accusations against Mr. Park were also a blow to \u200bPresident Moon Jae-in’s governing liberal Democratic Party\u200b, of which Mr. Park had been a member. Two other party members have\u200b recently\u200b become the focus of the #MeToo movement. In April, Oh Keo-don, the mayor of Busan, South Korea’s second-largest city, admitted to sexual misconduct and resigned after a public servant accused him of sexually assaulting her in his office. In 2018, Ahn Hee-jung, a rising star in Mr. Moon’s party and a presidential hopeful, stepped down as governor of South Chungcheong Province after his secretary went on television to accuse him of repeatedly sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on rape charges.']","A fact-finding team will have no power to subpoena or indict anyone, but women’s rights activists and the mayor’s accuser have called for an investigation anyway."
"E.U. Leaders Meet to Discuss Virus Rescue Plan, With Obstacles Ahead",2020-07-17,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — European Union leaders gathered on Friday to start hammering out a giant aid package to help their economies recover from the coronavirus calamity. But even before they began, the haggling had exposed fundamental differences between member states that must be finessed in coming days if they are to succeed in saving Europe’s economy. The major sticking point is how much latitude to give those receiving the aid to spend it as they please. Since much of the money is  guaranteed by wealthier northern states, some of them are demanding that strings be attached to push economic, political, environmental and social reforms. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose nation recently took over the European Union’s rotating presidency and who has led efforts to push ahead with the package, previously sounded optimistic. But she was cautious as she arrived about the prospects of reaching a deal.  “It would be desirable but we must also face reality,” she said. “I expect very difficult negotiations,.” The  talks will continue at least into Saturday night, and no announcement is expected until then. It was the first time E.U. leaders held an in-person meeting since the outbreak of the pandemic that has upended so many of their plans, and officials hoped that being together would help them advance compromise faster. Video  showed them wearing masks and greeting each other with gentle bows and elbow-bumps. The leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia — who have most challenged the bloc’s liberal, democratic principles — broke ranks and posed together maskless. The logistics around organizing the meeting in the time of Covid-19 were cumbersome. Special floor markings indicated distancing and the preferred flow of officials in the building.  The leaders met in the biggest room in the new Europa building. It fits 300 people. Only the heads of 27 governments and the leaders of E.U. institutions were admitted. Earlier guidance had indicated that the leaders would be allowed on occasion to be visited by close advisers. But the usual dozen-plus entourage per leader is a thing of the past: they were limited to five advisers each.  The show of bonhomie disguised political pressures and longstanding cultural differences that have slowed the quest for a swift agreement  spearheaded by Ms. Merkel along with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. Familiar trenches are being dug. Some northern European countries led by the Netherlands want sweeping liberalization of southern countries’ economies and a reform of their public finances in exchange for stimulus. Most members from Europe’s west want Hungary, Poland and other eastern members to adhere to environmental targets, to stop eroding the rule of law and to end attacks on immigrants and minority groups such as their Jewish and L.G.B.T. citizens if they are to tap E.U. funds. The leaders will try to agree on 1.8 trillion euros in funding — about $2 trillion — of which just over €1.1 trillion will be allocated to the bloc’s budget for the next seven years, the normal way of setting out E.U. spending, and €750 billion will be separated out for a pandemic recovery fund. The recovery component under discussion includes a bold proposal that will enable the E.U. administrative branch, the European Commission, to borrow in the financial markets on a large scale and offer part of the funds it raises for free in the form of grants to needy members. In practice, that will mean more creditworthy E.U. nations will be underwriting loans to fund the recoveries of countries that would otherwise face  onerous borrowing costs. In combination with a European Central Bank program to buy member states’ debt at low interest rates to enable them to continue funding stimulus programs, the proposed €750 billion plan would be a major help to those most in need, especially in the European south where structurally weak economies were hammered by the coronavirus. Economists predict a recession unseen outside wartime in the region. Italy, Spain and France, the bloc’s third, fourth and second-largest economies, will suffer the most, clocking in contractions of around 10 percent each this year. Greece and other smaller economies that were recovering from the bloc’s last recession will also be badly affected by the downturn. But heavy debt loads in many of these nations make them reluctant to amass yet more debt, and their budgets aren’t sufficient to self-fund their recoveries, which leads them to turn to the European Union for help. Richer countries like Germany, which has played a catalytic role in forging compromise, stand to benefit from a fast and steady recovery in their weaker southern neighbors. They share a currency, the euro, and a common market for their goods and services. Germany’s shifting role, from leader of the conservative rich north to champion of compromise, could be the deciding factor in this new battle for the European Union. “Germany has made a visible differentiation of its position,” said Maria Demertzis, an economist and the deputy director of the Brussels-based research institute Bruegel. “It hasn’t forgotten issues of conditionality and reforms, but, for this moment, it’s reordering its priorities.” This leaves the northern nations to be led by the Dutch, who are demanding a role in scrutinizing how the money is spent by their peers, which Italy and others view as unacceptable encroachment on their business. They instead propose that the European Commission act as a fair arbiter of whether countries’ stimulus plans are wise and well designed.  Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who faces a close election in less than a year, wants his Parliament to have a say in the disbursement of funding, a view that no other nation shares. “I estimate the chance of us reaching an agreement this weekend is less than 50 percent,” Mr. Rutte said as he arrived at the meeting in Brussels on Friday morning, dimming hopes for a quick agreement. His insistence on strict conditions to the aid has irritated southern members, leading to tensions that are bound to play out in the negotiations. “To be fair, what the Dutch are saying isn’t wrong, when they raise issues of big debts, or flag that countries need to reform,” Ms. Demertzis said. “But the question is timing: Is this the conversation you want to be having right now? The diplomacy is not right, the substance is.”  It is far from certain that they’ll reach an agreement. It is possible, rather, that they continue their talks on Sunday and even reconvene later this month, but there is consensus that they should have an agreement before an August summer break. And while the proposed package includes mechanisms that would force countries to adhere to ambitious environmental goals and push them to improve the way they deal with their rule of law and minorities at home, certain eastern members object. “Linking those two areas, those two completely different legal areas, creates an enormous threat of legal certainty,” said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland as he arrived at the meeting. “We can’t agree to that.” In the run-up to the meeting, his ally Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary prepared for a similar battle, getting his Parliament to vote on a resolution stating that E.U. procedures against Hungary for rule-of-law violations must be closed before the new budget is adopted, and that funding shouldn’t be dependent on rule-of-law requirements.  The aid package under discussion will allow the European Commission to develop new muscles that will make it resemble a federal government more than ever before. But many members view the institution with suspicion because it is a vast bureaucracy with little democratic accountability. The commission has in the past used the E.U. budget to issue bonds, but never at the scale proposed, and never to then distribute those loans for free. The proposals stress that this will be a  one-time exercise to combat a disastrous recession. The proposals will also allow the commission to find ways to raise its own funds, for example through a tax on carbon emissions, digital services and other cross-border activities. If it goes ahead, the commission will be managing both spending and revenue sides of the E.U.  balance sheet, and will be given the authority to levy taxes, a privilege usually reserved for elected governments. “We need to see what comes out of the meetings, but if this passes, it is in the direction of the countries backstopping a grant: This is an incredible step forward,” said Ms. Demertzis. “Everyone is talking about this being a one-off, but as we all know, there’s nothing more permanent than temporary measures.” Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting from Brussels and Ben Novak contributed from Budapest.']",Domestic political pressures and longstanding cultural differences are putting a brake on Angela Merkel’s push for swift agreement.
The Tahini War: The Food at the Center of an Arab Gay Rights Battle,2020-07-15,By Adam Rasgon,"['TEL AVIV — When Julia Zaher, the owner of a company that makes some of the most popular tahini in Israel, made a donation to an Israeli gay rights group recently, she saw it as an unremarkable act. “When I see people in a tough place, I always like to help them,” Ms. Zaher, 65, an Arab citizen of Israel, said in an interview. “If everyone turns their back on this community, who is going to help?” But after the gay rights organization publicly thanked her, the backlash in Israel’s socially conservative Arab community was swift and unforgiving. Activists called for a boycott of her company, Al Arz. Videos circulated on Facebook and Twitter of Arab shopkeepers pulling Al Arz’s tahini from their shelves and throwing it in the garbage. An executive at one of the largest Arab-owned grocery chains in Israel, Al Mashadawi, said it was considering dropping Al Arz from its 14 stores. “We have values that we follow,” said Jabr Hejazi, a supermarket owner in the northern town of Tamra who abruptly stopped carrying the brand. “It’s a simple matter.” But gay rights activists say the controversy has had the welcome side effect of focusing attention on a group whose problems have been ignored for too long: gay and transgender members of Israel’s Arab minority, who say they are marginalized and discriminated twice over. “This is a huge event,” said Khader Abu-Seif, 33, an L.G.B.T. rights activist in Tel Aviv. “Of course, we’re seeing ugliness, but we’re also seeing support from people who never spoke out openly for us in the past.” Ms. Zaher, a mild-mannered, strong-willed mother of two from Nazareth, may seem an unlikely catalyst for the controversy. A schoolteacher for decades, she took over her husband’s tahini business when he died after a heart attack in 2003. The company was in poor financial shape, she said in an interview on Saturday in Tel Aviv. But she poured herself into it, paying off debts, convincing the bank to lend her more money and upgrading the manufacturing process. Today, her company’s two plants in the Nazareth area produce a whopping 20 to 25 tons of tahini a day. The thick paste they make from Ethiopian sesame seeds is nearly ubiquitous at supermarkets and restaurants in Israel, and is exported to 18 countries including the United States. And Ms. Zaher became the rare woman to lead a major Arab-owned company. No stranger to philanthropy, she had made previous donations to benefit women’s rights and people with disabilities. The donation she made to Aguda, a national L.G.B.T. rights organization, was to help set up a hotline for Arabic-speaking Israelis. The group’s C.E.O., Ohad Hizki, declined to say how much Ms. Zaher had given, but called it “significant.” He said the hotline would be open for calls by next month. The controversy erupted when Aguda thanked Ms. Zaher on Twitter on July 1. Mouad Khateb, one of the most prominent opponents of the donation, expressed the views of many critics, saying that he had no objection to whatever gay and transgender people do in private, but that the donation would contribute to “normalizing” their “unnatural” way of life to the Arab public. “What’s most problematic is when Arabs are participating in these efforts,” said Mr. Khateb, who has used derogatory terms to describe members of the L.G.B.T. community and claimed that they suffered from “psychological disorders” requiring “treatment.” But the boycott has also drawn public opposition from supporters of gay rights. “I’m with Al Arz against the boycott,” wrote Hana Amoury, a resident of the port city of Jaffa, on Facebook. “Those still saying and thinking gay people are ‘abnormal’ need to do some reading.” Mr. Abu-Seif, the activist, noted that an Arab lawmaker from Acre, Aida Touma-Sliman, had spoken out in defense of the L.G.B.T. community — a rare instance, he said, and a sign that it was becoming more difficult for Arab politicians to remain on the sidelines when the L.G.B.T. community was under assault. Aside from the anti-gay backlash, some gay Arabs also criticized the donation for going to an Israeli organization, which they contend supports policies that work to erase the Palestinian experience, instead of a Palestinian one. Aguda denies the accusation, saying it advocates equal rights for all gay and transgender people in Israel, regardless of their religious or national background. Al Arz’s donation was only the latest in a series of public demonstrations of support for Arab gays and lesbians, activists say. In May, thousands of mourners attended the funeral of Ayman Safiah, a gay dancer who drowned in the Mediterranean after helping save the life of a friend. And last August, hundreds of people protested in Haifa after the stabbing of a young transgender Arab. “What we have been seeing is the taboo slowly being broken down,” said Fady Khoury, 35, a gay civil rights lawyer from Haifa. “Everything that happened in the past year is the culmination of the work that has been done over the past two decades — all the efforts activists have made to promote social change on this issue.” But Ms. Zaher, whose phone has been ringing constantly over the past week, said she was still puzzled by the uproar. “I never could have imagined that something like this would happen,” she said. “It doesn’t make sense: You do something positive and then you get something negative in return.”']","After an Arab tahini magnate donated to an Israeli gay rights group, her company faced a boycott.

"Shamima Begum, Who Joined ISIS in Syria, Can Return to U.K., Court Says",2020-07-16,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Shamima Begum, a woman who traveled to Syria from London as a schoolgirl to join ISIS, should be allowed to return to appeal the government’s decision to strip her of her British citizenship, a court ruled on Thursday. The Court of Appeal ruled that the only way Ms. Begum would be able to pursue a “fair and effective appeal” was “to be permitted to come into the United Kingdom.” Ms. Begum, now 20, spent years in Islamic State territory, but fled to a refugee camp in northeastern Syria after the group lost control in the region, and had expressed a desire to return to Britain. Her case is a prominent example of the challenges many Western governments face with citizens who joined the group, and who some argue would pose a national security threat if repatriated. Through a spokesman, the British Home Office, the government department responsible for migration and security, said it would appeal what it called “a very disappointing decision.” Ms. Begum’s lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, praised the court’s ruling, writing on Twitter, “Good sense prevails.” Ms. Begum first made headlines five years ago, when she and two classmates, who came to be known as the Bethnal Green girls after the neighborhood in London where they had lived, boarded a flight to Turkey and then traveled to Syria to reach territories of the Islamic State at a time when the terrorist organization was at the height of its power. Ms. Begum married a young Dutch fighter weeks after her arrival and later gave birth to three children. All have since died. In February last year, a British journalist located Ms. Begum in Al Hol refugee camp in northeastern Syria, where the families of thousands of Islamic State fighters had fled. She told the reporter that she was “willing to change,” and asked the authorities “to re-evaluate my case, with a bit of mercy in their heart.” But that same month, her family was informed that she would be stripped of her British citizenship, the only citizenship she has, in a letter from Sajid Javid, then the country’s home secretary. Despite concerns that this would render Ms. Begum stateless, British law allows the home secretary to revoke the citizenship of a single nationality holder if there is “reasonable ground” to believe that the person can acquire another citizenship elsewhere. Ms. Begum appealed, but a special tribunal ruled the decision was lawful because she was “a citizen of Bangladesh by descent” from her mother, who is a citizen of the South Asian nation. Since then, she has pleaded with the British authorities to repatriate her to stand trial in her home country, something the government has vowed never to do. The authorities in Bangladesh have said that Ms. Begum never claimed citizenship of that nation and that she would not be allowed in Bangladesh. The ruling that Ms. Begum is entitled to return to Britain to appeal the decision on her citizenship does not mean that she will be successful in having it restored, however. The case will be reviewed by the special tribunal that initially ruled that removing Ms. Begum’s citizenship was lawful. But those opposed to Ms. Begum’s return to Britain say her repatriation for the citizenship appeal could pave the way for her to remain in the country indefinitely, as it is unlikely she would be sent back to a detention camp in northeastern Syria. “If Ms. Begum does come back to this country, it will prove impossible to remove her,” Mr. Javid, the former official who stripped Ms. Begum of her citizenship, said in a statement. Mr. Javid said her presence in Britain would create a “national security risk that cannot be fully mitigated.” Governments in Britain, France and other countries have so far refused repatriation in most Islamic State-linked cases, taking back only some children and families on a case-by-case basis. A growing chorus of academics, psychologists and rights organizations have urged the authorities to repatriate their citizens, citing appalling conditions in refugee camps and detention centers, and a right to be given a fair trial at home. About 900 children from Western nations — including Australia, Belgium, Britain and France — have spent years in limbo in camps in Syria. But the authorities have struggled to outline a comprehensive policy for ISIS detainees and their families. Shiraz Maher, the director at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King’s College London, said in a Twitter post that many governments worried that trying ISIS sympathizers at home could result in acquittals or minimal sentences, because of the challenge of gathering evidence. In several countries, including Britain and France, defendants can be convicted of joining a terrorist organization if they traveled to a territory controlled by an extremist group. Yet dozens of people convicted of such crimes are expected to be released in the coming years, raising fears that they could plan or carry out attacks. “The danger is that you can’t secure a proper conviction against them,” Mr. Maher said on Twitter. “Then you have these people walking our streets, which is unfathomable. Or you secure a conviction on a lesser charge and they’re out in a few years.”']","Ms. Begum, now 20, left London in 2015 and was stripped of her British citizenship.

Myanmar Plan to Breed Protected Species in Captivity Draws Criticism,2020-07-15,By Richard C. Paddock and Saw Nang,"['BANGKOK — Myanmar will soon adopt rules that would permit captive breeding of about 175 threatened species, including tigers, pangolins and Irrawaddy dolphins, despite fears that such ventures could encourage poaching of wild animals and spawn new diseases that jump to humans. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation quietly circulated a list of wildlife last month that could be raised commercially for display in zoos, tourist attractions or hotels and, in a handful of cases, to produce meat for sale to the public. Government officials assert that the list is aimed at improving wildlife protection by reducing illegal hunting and increasing conservation under a 2018 law. The government is expected to issue detailed rules on commercial breeding in coming months, said U Naing Zaw Htun, the ministry’s director of wildlife conservation. But international conservation groups said the plan could undermine wildlife protection by increasing demand for wild meat and for species used in traditional medicine. “Commercial trade has been shown to increase illegal trade in wildlife by creating a parallel market and boosting overall demand for wild animal products,” the World Wildlife Fund and Fauna and Flora International said in a joint statement questioning the government plan. The list posted on government websites identifies 89 species of mammals, birds and reptiles, including such rare creatures as the helmeted hornbill, the Bengal slow loris and the white-handed gibbon. The list also includes a reference to snakes as a broad category. At least 100 snake species in Myanmar are threatened, including the Burmese python, the spitting cobra and the Russell’s viper, said U Kyi Soe Lwin, manager of the privately run Yangon Zoological Garden. Conservationists contend that commercial breeding of protected wildlife would undermine efforts to protect endangered species. Captive breeding has little conservation value, they say, because such animals are rarely suited for release in the wild. Animal experts and conservationists said that at least 175 of the species covered by the list are considered threatened in Myanmar or globally. It is unclear whether the rules would allow endangered animals to be captured in the wild. Under the ministry’s plan, eight species can be commercially farmed for meat, including at least one that is listed as threatened in Myanmar — the estuarine, or saltwater, crocodile. Mr. Naing Zaw Htun, the government official, defended the inclusion of the crocodile because breeding it for its meat and skin is already permitted. Keeping wildlife for human consumption, especially in crowded Asian markets, has been linked to viruses that have infected humans, including the coronavirus that has caused the current pandemic and SARS, which emerged in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide. Conservationists and health experts have urged governments around the world to curb consumption of wild meat, or bush meat, as it is sometimes known. “Commercial wildlife breeding and trade can also increase the risk of disease spillover from wildlife to humans, such as Covid-19,” the World Wildlife Fund and Fauna and Flora International said. The pangolin, which at one point was suspected of playing a part in the transmission of the new coronavirus, could be bred in Myanmar zoos under the new regulations. Both of the country’s species, the Sunda pangolin and the Chinese pangolin, are critically endangered, said U Nay Myo Shwe, a wildlife expert with Fauna and Flora International. Permitting captive breeding of tigers in Myanmar could open a new base of operations for illegal tiger traders. In much of Southeast Asia, demand for tiger parts in traditional Chinese medicine and human encroachment have put tremendous pressure on the species. Conservationists say that a flourishing market in tiger parts gives poachers an incentive to hunt wild tigers and sell them. In Myanmar, scientists have identified 22 individual tigers in the wild and estimate that no more than 50 survive in two fragmented habitats, giving the species little chance of long-term survival. Edwin Wiek, the founder of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said he expected investors seeking to establish tiger farms in Myanmar would obtain animals from China and Laos, where enforcement is relatively lax. Another endangered species on the government’s list is the Irrawaddy dolphin. Mr. Nay Myo Shwe, the wildlife expert, said only about 75 of the freshwater dolphins survive in Myanmar, where they inhabit the Irrawaddy River for which they are named. None are in captivity, he said, and so the only way to begin commercial breeding would be to capture a pair. “Putting dolphins in zoos would be like having them live in lockdown conditions,” he said. “The nature of the dolphin is they like to range freely in a very wide area, not in a limited area like a zoo.” Similarly, he questioned the inclusion of the helmeted hornbill, which is so critically endangered that its numbers are unknown. Like the dolphin, none are kept in captivity, so commercial breeding would mean capturing them. The helmeted hornbill, which lives in Myanmar’s dwindling pristine forests, has long been sought for its large horn, which is prized for carving and is sometimes used in China as a substitute for ivory.']","Myanmar’s conservation ministry is considering captive breeding of as many as 175 threatened species, including tigers, Irrawaddy dolphins and rare birds that exist only in the wild."
China Vows to Retaliate After Trump Signs Hong Kong Sanctions Bill,2020-07-15,By Steven Lee Myers,"['China on Wednesday sharply criticized President Trump’s moves to strip Hong Kong of its preferential trading status with the United States and clear the way for new sanctions on officials and companies there, vowing to retaliate with punitive measures of its own. The response from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing promised to continue a pattern of tit-for-tat punishments that have accompanied the sharp downward turn in relations between the two countries on a variety of fronts, from trade to technology to human rights. China was swift to criticize Mr. Trump’s latest actions, which he announced at a rambling White House news conference on Tuesday. Those moves, along with his remarks, underscored the extent to which relations with Beijing have become intertwined with the American presidential election. Mr. Trump said he had issued an executive order revoking the special trading status that Hong Kong had enjoyed for more than two decades, following the Chinese government’s imposition of a sweeping new national security law there.  The law came into force on June 30, and its chilling effect on political freedoms in the city — which, under a formula called “one country, two systems,” is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy from China — has already been evident in a series of arrests and police raids. Mr. Trump also signed legislation, adopted overwhelmingly in May by Congress, that authorizes the administration to impose sanctions on officials or institutions, including banks, that were found to have undermined Hong Kong’s semiautonomous status.  His executive order, besides revoking the territory’s special trading status, calls for sanctions against people deemed to have been involved in a variety of acts in Hong Kong, including arrests made under the new security law and actions that undermine democratic processes or limit the news media’s freedoms. Officials in Beijing had clearly anticipated the moves, but they reacted harshly nonetheless. “The act on the United States side maliciously denigrates Hong Kong’s national security legislation, threatens to impose sanctions on China and gravely violates international law and basic rules of international relations,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement posted on Wednesday morning in China, not long after Mr. Trump finished speaking.  “It is gross interference in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs,” the ministry said. The Hong Kong government said in a statement that the United States was “using human rights, democracy and autonomy as an excuse” to introduce measures aimed at attacking China.  The impact of the new powers detailed in the American law and Mr. Trump’s executive order remains to be seen. Congress has authorized similar measures before, only to have the administration delay imposing them as it weighed other foreign policy considerations, including Mr. Trump’s signature trade deal with China. With relations deteriorating badly and the pandemic’s toll mounting in the United States, the administration has acted more aggressively in recent weeks. When the United States imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials over China’s crackdown on Uighurs and other Muslims in the far western region of Xinjiang, Beijing reciprocated by announcing travel bans and sanctions on prominent Republican members of Congress. Lau Siu-kai, a senior adviser to the Chinese government on Hong Kong policy, said the American actions would have limited effect on Hong Kong and would, contrary to the intent of the United States, drive the territory closer to mainland China. “The overall damage to Hong Kong and to China is rather minimal and can be absorbed,” said Mr. Lau, a former senior Hong Kong government official who is now with the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies. He said Hong Kong was becoming “increasingly detached from the United States and the West, and increasingly attached to China and Asia.” Others said the American actions could have more significant effects by hurting the city’s reputation for openness and rule of law. That could affect companies as well as academia.  “The only way we can regain the respect and favorable conditions that we deserve is if Beijing fulfills its original promise to the world and Hong Kong people, which is the genuine implementation of ‘one country, two systems’ and our high degree of autonomy,” said James To, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker.  Reporting and research were contributed by Keith Bradsher and Claire Fu in Beijing and Elaine Yu in Hong Kong.']",Beijing accused the United States of “gross interference in Hong Kong affairs” and promised a response. 
"U.K. Police Step Back on Victims’ Data, a Flash Point in Rape Cases",2020-07-16,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — The police in England and Wales said on Thursday that they would stop routinely asking victims of crime to allow checks of their electronic devices, such as computers and laptops, after critics said the practice discouraged people from reporting offenses, particularly in sex cases. Tim De Meyer, a top official for the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said in a statement that the practice needed to be reviewed. “Searches of digital devices should not be automatic and will happen only when the investigating officer or prosecutor considers there to be a need to access information to pursue a reasonable line of inquiry,” he said. Mr. De Meyer, who is an assistant chief constable of Thames Valley Police, a force in southern England, added that no victim “should feel discouraged from reporting a crime to the police.” Consent forms to be filled in by complainants were introduced last year, immediately raising privacy concerns, especially regarding the potential to further discourage victims of already underreported offenses, such as sexual assault, from going to the police. Those fears were underlined in a June report by the Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent government watchdog, on how the police were gathering digital data. The report came out after a legal challenge brought by two women last year who had made rape complaints and who had objected to the downloading of their data. The women had argued that offering such access to their devices was not relevant to their allegations and that the use of the forms was unlawful, discriminatory and intrusive. The commissioner’s report highlighted concerns that the police were inconsistent in their approach and sometimes cast the net “overly wide” in seeking data. It also warned that demanding consent to comb digital data “should not be viewed as a coercive option” and advised officers to assume that anything held on a mobile phone or other personal device “amounts to sensitive data from the outset.” Pressure to drop the consent forms grew last month when the Court of Appeal, reviewing two separate rape cases, issued a set of legal principles for data disclosure. The court stated that investigators should not review a witness’s digital data “without good cause” and that the request to inspect such material must, in every case, “have a proper basis.” “There is a misconception, that is possibly widespread, that certain types of criminal allegations — most particularly those that are sexual in nature — ipso facto result in the right to automatic and unfettered access by investigators to the complainant’s digital information,” Lord Justice Fulford, vice president of the Court of Appeal, said as part of the ruling. “This is assuredly not the case.” Mr. De Meyer, the National Police Chiefs’ Council official, sent a letter to police forces saying that both the watchdog report and the Court of Appeal judgment made it clear that the consent forms were “not sufficient for their intended purpose.” The consent forms would be replaced with interim documents that will take into account the watchdog report and the appeal court’s findings, he said. The College of Policing would also produce guidance on investigative practice when mobile phone investigation is needed, he added. Previously, the police could routinely ask victims and witnesses for access to data such as text messages, emails, contacts, social media records, internet browsing history and more. If complainants refused, the case could be dropped. Furthermore, if investigators came across something incriminating — even if it was irrelevant to the original case — the accuser could be in jeopardy. Harriet Wistrich, director of the Center for Women’s Justice, a public interest law firm that represented the two women who mounted the legal challenge, expressed relief that the previous consent forms would no longer be used. She argued that their impact had been to delay rape cases and to discourage victims from coming forward. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, an independent government body that assisted with the women’s case, said that there were no grounds to support the idea that the extraction forms were necessary to build evidence. “As they are predominantly applied to survivors of rape or sexual assault, they disproportionately impact on women and act as a discriminatory barrier to justice,” she said in a statement.']","Forms asking for consent to comb devices such as phones and laptops had caused concerns that they would deter people from reporting crimes, particularly in rape and other sex cases."
India Coronavirus Cases Surge Past One Million,2020-07-17,By Karan Deep Singh and Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — India hit a milestone on Friday morning  that it had made great sacrifices to avoid: recording more than one million coronavirus infections. The virus has been gnawing its way across this country of 1.3 billion people and gaining speed, fueled by high population density, an already beleaguered health care system and a calculation by the central government to lift a nationwide lockdown in hopes of getting the economy up and running, come what may. But as India’s number of confirmed new infections keeps hitting record highs, many states and cities have been locking down again. In some areas, long lines of bodies snake out of cremation grounds. India is now racking up about 30,000 new reported infections each day — more than any other country except the United States and Brazil, and it is catching up to Brazil. India now has the third-highest total cases — 1,003,832 cases and 25,602 deaths —  after the United States and Brazil. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate that by the end of next year, India will be the worst-hit country in the world. “We have paid a price for laxity,” said K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, a nonprofit organization of public health experts and academics. About 25,000 deaths have been officially attributed to Covid-19, but testing remains sparse, so the real figure could be significantly higher. Schools and universities have been shut since March with no clear plans to reopen, leaving nearly 278 million students without much to do. The central government recently advised school systems to limit online learning to a few hours a day. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, India’s minister for human resource development, said this was required to make sure that students didn’t get “overly stretched or stressed.” More than 100 million Indians have lost their jobs. The economy, which already had been showing deep cracks before the pandemic, is now forecast to contract by as much as 9.5 percent in the year that began on April 1, a stunning reversal from the last decade, when India had one of the hottest economies on earth. In the early days of the pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took swift action. He advised masks and social distancing. At a time when India had fewer than 1,000 known infections — though the true figure was certainly higher — he imposed a severe nationwide lockdown that would last nearly three months. Millions of migrant laborers, who over the years had gravitated to jobs in the cities, suddenly found themselves with little or no work. They poured out of the cities and back into the countryside, hoping to rely on relatives in their home villages to survive. In the process, they spread coronavirus infections into nearly every corner of India. As the economic pain really began to bite, Mr. Modi changed course. Last month he urged the leaders of India’s 28 states and 8 territories to “unlock, unlock, unlock.” Public health experts say Mr. Modi got it backward and should have waited until the crisis was further along, and then imposed a strict lockdown. The early lockdown was “premature and it did nothing” because the virus hadn’t spread at the time, said Dr. Anand Krishnan, a professor of epidemiology at the New Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “Now is the time to impose such drastic public health measures.” The worst hit areas are India’s biggest cities, like Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad and the tech hub of Bengaluru. The crowded urban areas, where many families live eight or even ten people per room, make social distancing nearly impossible, hastening the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus. Officials in India’s northeastern state of Bihar imposed a two-week lockdown beginning Thursday after a sudden spike in cases — more than 20,000 in 24 hours. Bihar is a source of migrant labor across India; the surge in Bihar’s cases correlates with the return of workers from distant cities. A sharp rise in cases has also forced a new lockdown in Goa, a state on India’s western coast that is famed for its beaches, just a few weeks after it reopened to tourists, a lifeline to the state economy. The southern state of Kerala, which had been largely successful in controlling the spread of the virus, also extended lockdown restrictions by a week in its biggest city, Thiruvananthapuram, after cases nearly doubled in just a few days. “We need more focus on the new COVID-19 hot spot in South Asia,” said a statement from John Fleming, an official with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “Lives of people in India are no less valuable than people in other parts of the world.” Mr. Modi and top government officials have repeatedly said in televised speeches that India is doing better than richer countries, especially when it comes to the death rate. India has reported about 20 coronavirus-related deaths per million people, while many other nations, including the United States, Brazil, Spain, Italy have all lost hundreds per million. “I don’t think it has anything to do with how the government has handled the pandemic,” Dr. Krishnan said. Instead, he said, it’s because India’s average age is younger than that of other countries, and obesity and diabetes, which increase people’s vulnerability to the virus, are less prevalent here. The Indian Medical Association, said that Covid-19 has killed 99 doctors. “If Covid mortality has to be lessened, it has to start with doctors,” the organization said in a news release Wednesday. Public health experts say India still lacks a transparent and robust mechanism to respond to a crisis of this magnitude. And what’s needed, they say, is a vigorous and energetic response from both the government and citizens. “Opening malls and allowing large religious gatherings is not the way,” said Mr. Reddy. “You can’t give the virus a highway to travel.”']",Several states and cities have reimposed total and partial lockdowns as the pandemic accelerates. India now ranks third in the world in infections.
It’s Merkel’s Last Rodeo. Will a Pandemic Rescue Deal Seal Her Legacy?,2020-07-16,By Steven Erlanger,"['BRUSSELS — Finishing her 15th year as chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, the European Union’s longest-serving and most respected leader, now has her last, best chance to shape the future of the bloc and her own legacy. With her long reign winding down, she and Germany have assumed the E.U.’s rotating presidency, which lasts through the end of the year, at a moment when the bloc is badly divided over a coronavirus recovery plan, a new seven-year budget and threats to the rule of law in eastern member states. Ms. Merkel faces her first big test on Friday, when she and other leaders are to convene their first in-person summit meeting in Brussels since the coronavirus outbreak took hold in Europe five months ago. With a sense of urgency, they will try to hash out a consensus on how best to help European nations clobbered by the virus. Expectations for Ms. Merkel’s leadership are high. But while this may be her last rodeo, many expect the same cautious pragmatism and reluctance to take bold, transformative steps that have characterized her time in office and her response to past European crises. As a politician, Ms. Merkel, soon to be 66,  remains, as ever, deliberately opaque, allowing many to imagine her support for their own preferred outcomes. But as much as she is committed to the European Union, she has consistently sought that sweet spot where German and European interests align, guided by German public opinion and her own careful personality. While she has understood in the current crisis that the European economy needs a rescue, she is also keenly aware that Germany needs a strong European economy for its own continued prosperity. That, as much as anything, led her to break new ground with France by backing pooled debt among E.U. members to stave off the economic crash of the pandemic — what she last week called “the greatest test the European Union has ever faced.” The proposal — grants worth 500 billion euros, or about $570 billion, for regions hit hardest by the pandemic — represented a reversal of the fierce German opposition to collective European debt. Some hailed her move as a sea change, one that would seal her legacy as a Europeanist, much as Helmut Kohl is remembered for his support of the euro currency. But others are skeptical, instead seeing a unique and typically pragmatic response to a crisis that threatened the European single market and thus the German economy. Ms. Merkel, who tends to say what she means, has made it clear that such largess was a “one-off.” “Germany has moved a lot,” said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. “Germans were always ready in the presidency to put a bit more on the table, but without the virus, there would have been no revolution in the budget.” Ulrich Speck, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said that Ms. Merkel remained true to herself, and that she was shifting only because Germans, deeply embedded in the European Union, want to help those ravaged by the pandemic, especially in Italy and Spain. “For her, this does not really change the European Union, and public opinion is behind it,” Mr. Speck said. “This is not controversial; this is crisis management. What would be controversial would be a permanent change of structure.” But others, especially European federalists in France and Italy, dare to believe Ms. Merkel harbors secret sympathy for deeper European integration and prefer to see her as breaking a taboo. Even if that were true, with her time in office coming to an end, any more permanent shift in policy would have to come from her successor, and few believe that the current band of potential chancellors would have the political weight, let alone the desire, to repeat the exercise. But first she must get a deal, which will not be simple, given that all 27 member countries must agree.  There is significant opposition from northern European nations like the Netherlands and Austria, which oppose grants and want loans to come with conditions about structural change in weaker economies. And there will be a fight over how the money is distributed and monitored. Still, given the stakes, Ms. Merkel is likely to succeed at finding some agreement — if not this week then before the end of the month, when Europe goes on vacation, no matter how serious the crisis. She has made clear that she will not run for office again, and by the end of this year, when Germany’s European presidency ends, her party will have picked a new leader, rendering her a place holder before German elections in 2021. Within Germany, Ms. Merkel had a deep and lasting dip in popularity following her 2015 decision to open the country’s borders to thousands of migrants and refugees. As she entered this year, her political powers were waning, her party’s support was cratering and even her health seemed in question after a series of shaking episodes at public events. In Europe more broadly, her reluctance to stand up to domestic pressure during the Greek euro crisis of the last decade cost the bloc dearly. Many, particularly in the south, have never forgiven her. But the chancellor is riding high again in Germany, having handled the coronavirus outbreak with patience and reason, building on her experience and her training as a scientist. And there are now lavish hopes in Brussels that she will similarly rise to the moment, finding consensus despite the current rancor. But Ms. Merkel is still seen as a holdover of an older Europe, one that profited from friendly relations with the United States, a healthy trans-Atlantic relationship, a strong NATO and a global consensus about the virtues of multilateralism and of engagement with a rising China. Those bedrock beliefs are now in question. As much as she is praised for her steadiness, there is a deep sense in Europe that she is yesterday’s leader, her core beliefs no longer a given in a more rivalrous, competitive world. The pandemic has provided an opportunity for her to change the narrative. It created political space for her to push Germany in a more European direction, said Simon Tilford, of the Forum for a New Economy in Berlin. “This is an opportunity to ensure her legacy as a chancellor who bit the bullet and convinced Germans that it’s in their interest to accept greater responsibility for the performance of the European economy as a whole,” he said. “That’s one reason she’s so outspoken about the existential threat to the E.U.,” he added. “It makes it easier to convince skeptics at home that this is something Berlin has to do for its own interests.” But trying is not enough, and her prospects for success are unclear — particularly without a successor in place. “It’s a pity she didn’t use her political capital earlier,” Mr. Tilford said. “Because she’ll be gone, and the jury is very much out on how much of her party is happy to move with her.” Charles A. Kupchan, former director for Europe on the National Security Council  and professor of international relations at Georgetown, said that “the pandemic has woken up Merkel and Berlin.” While President Emmanuel Macron of France was trying to articulate a vision for a more integrated Europe, he said, “the lights were out in Berlin — there was no response.” But the pandemic raised the prospect of a collapse of the eurozone, “with ground zero being not Greece but Italy, a much larger economy, so Merkel crossed the Rubicon,” Mr. Kupchan said. “But my best guess is that this is not a moment of conversion for Merkel. She is responding to an emergency with emergency measures,” he added. “She does not have the inclination for some dramatic change in the European architecture or the political support for it.” As for her legacy, others seem to care more about it than Ms. Merkel does. She is admired in Brussels, showing a competence and practical knowledge unmatched by other leaders, said Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe. “But I’m a bit perplexed about her,” Ms. Balfour said. “She’s incredibly pragmatic, knows her dossiers and how the system works, and can wield soft power. But it’s not clear to me what her vision of her legacy in European politics is,” other than dealing with issues as they emerge. “In contrast to Macron, who goes on about this vision of Europe that no one shares, she doesn’t really have one.”']",Angela Merkel has been the German chancellor for 15 years. Forging European consensus on a bitterly disputed recovery fund could burnish an uneven record.
"Fighting Discrimination, a French Woman Becomes a Champion of Men",2020-07-17,By Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — Standing on a truck, her fist clenched high and her back turned to a row of police vans, Assa Traoré galvanized the crowd before her. “You are powerful!” she shouted, to the cheers of thousands who had gathered on the Place de la République in central Paris to protest police violence and racism. “Your faces have been seen all over the world!” Until just a few weeks ago, Ms. Traoré, 35, a special-education teacher of Malian descent, was largely known as the spokeswoman for The Truth for Adama, an advocacy group that has demanded justice for her half brother, Adama Traoré, who died in police custody in 2016 on his 24th birthday. But now, with the spread of Black Lives Matter protests, she has gained wider prominence as the champion of men who have been victims of discriminatory police violence in France. Ms. Traoré said that men in minority neighborhoods are more likely to be targeted by the police than women — and as a woman, she could help defend them by taking a stand where she was least expected. “With my female voice, we’re going to make these men visible and give them a voice,” Ms. Traoré said in an interview in her apartment in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing in the United States, which triggered a wave of anger that spanned the world, Ms. Traoré and her group have organized some of the biggest anti-racism protests in Europe. They assembled at least 20,000 protesters in front of a Paris courthouse early in June despite a police ban, then a crowd of 15,000 just 11 days later on the Place de la République. Protesters in recent weeks have included more white people and people from upper-class areas of Paris, Ms. Traoré said, as compared with the first demonstrations for Adama, back in 2016, which were mainly attended by people of color. “That’s when we thought: ‘This is it, the fight for Adama has become a popular fight,’” Ms. Traoré said. Ms. Traoré speaks with resolve. “France has not come to terms with its history, with slavery, with colonization,” she said. “These are unsaid things that leave traces, and we suffer the consequences.” France has struggled to confront racism for years. The Paris suburbs exploded in riots in 2005, driven by resentment among North African immigrants over their treatment by the police and discrimination in general, exposing the rest of France to the country’s racial fissures. France, which colonized parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, has failed to fully integrate immigrants from its former empire. Some of that is rooted in its commitment to universalism — a belief that no group should be given preference, but one that critics say has muted discussion and shielded the country from facing its colonial legacy. Ms. Traoré’s words have struck a chord among the younger generation, who have flocked to the protests. “She’s clear, and that makes her strong,” said Djenaba Dramé, a 21-year-old Black student at the demonstration on the Place de la République. Christiane Taubira, who in 2012 became the first Black woman to be named Justice Minister, has called her “a chance for France.” By all accounts, Ms. Traoré is a charismatic figure, easily identifiable as she rouses the crowd in her black T-shirt bearing the words “Justice for Adama. Without justice, you will never have peace.” She wears it almost daily. Born in Paris in 1985, Ms. Traoré draws on a family history in both France and Mali. Two of her great-grandfathers fought alongside French troops during World War II, when Mali was still a French colony, and her father, Mara-Siré Traoré, emigrated from Mali to France at age 17. Ms. Traoré is one of 17 siblings in a close-knit family where conversations were conducted in a blend of French, Soninke and Bambara languages. Her father married four women — two white Catholics whom he divorced and then two Malian Muslims with whom he lived at the same time, as permitted by Islamic law, despite the ban on polygamy in France. When he died of cancer in 1999, Ms. Traoré was 14. As the eldest child still at home, she took over the reins of the family, filling in for her mother, Hatouma, who did not speak fluent French, while continuing her studies to become a special-education teacher. “She took on an almost motherly role with my brothers and sisters,” said Lassana Traoré, 43, one of her oldest half brothers, who saw this experience as the foundation of her leadership today. Ms. Traoré said that helping boys in disadvantaged suburbs as part of her work in special education made her realize that Black and Arab men — whom she called “our brothers” — were targeted by the police when they became teenagers, a phenomenon that Human Rights Watch documented in a report last month. “Saying that men matter, that their voices count is part of our struggle,” Ms. Traoré said. “We must keep fighting so that all women around the world can have the rights they deserve. But who’s fighting, who’s defending our men?” She said that she drew inspiration from “Les Misérables,” the Oscar-nominated movie of the French film director Ladj Ly that depicts police violence against Black and Arab teenagers in a Paris suburb. “If those men had been more visible, perhaps my brother wouldn’t be dead today,” she added. Adama, her half brother, died in the courtyard of a police station on July 19, 2016, in circumstances that are still in dispute. Mr. Traoré was pinned down by three police officers, one of whom later acknowledged placing “the weight of all our bodies” on him, during an identity check that went awry. Mr. Traoré reportedly said that he could not breathe and likely passed out during his transfer to the police station in Persan, a small town north of Paris, where he was pronounced dead two hours later. Conflicting autopsies pointed to heart failure or asphyxiation as the cause of the death, but after much investigation there is still no clear picture of what happened. No charges have been filed against the officers whom the Traoré family accuse of having killed Adama. “I told myself that his death could not remain a minor news story,” Ms. Traoré said. “We could not forget him and just pretend, ‘Here’s another guy who died over the summer.’” Ms. Traoré said that the video of Mr. Floyd’s killing has helped “illustrate” what happened to her half brother. “People now understand how my brother died,” she said. But, she added, “If there hadn’t been this big organizational effort before, George Floyd’s death wouldn’t have made any difference.” With the help of seasoned anti-racist, left-wing activists, Ms. Traoré has worked to turn her advocacy group into a movement, keeping politicians at bay and relying mostly on social networks that keep her phone buzzing all the time. She has nearly 400,000 Instagram followers. Julien Talpin, a sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research, said that she had become “a central political figure” with whom many Black people, feeling neglected by French political parties, can easily identify. Ms. Traoré’s activism has infuriated French right-wing news media, which accuse her of trying to tear French society apart by pitting Black and white communities against each other. It has also put her at odds with the French authorities. She recently filed a libel suit against the Paris police chief and declined an invitation by the former justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, for a meeting, arguing that “justice should not be done in a tearoom at the Élysée Palace.” “A confrontation has been established,” Ms. Traoré said. “It’s a small victory. But we don’t want a small victory.”']","Assa Traoré had long demanded justice for her half brother, Adama, who died in police custody. Now, she embodies France’s fight against discriminatory police violence."
The Community That Covid-19 Built,2020-07-17,By Catherine Porter,"['The wagon on Jennifer Ois’s front porch is a symbol of the coronavirus’s silver lining. It’s red and wooden, with black rubber wheels that once fell off, when Ms. Ois was towing her first child and a frozen turkey home from a store many years ago. These days, the wagon is crowded with homemade things like fermented turmeric soda, ginger-berry kefir water, lemongrass ice cream and fresh lettuce from the garden, all waiting to be picked up by a neighbor. “Now it’s got a whole other purpose,” says Ms. Ois. It’s carrying kindness down her street. Since visiting her neighborhood on Hiawatha Road a few weeks ago, I’ve returned to it many times in my mind. I find it comforting. It reminds me that despite the virus’s darkness, it has offered some illumination — a slowing of time and a return to life’s essentials. The people on this street have used that time to learn old-fashioned skills like fermentation and growing vegetables, and in the process they’ve become a community. They’ve been lucky, too — while some on the street have lost employment to the virus, this part of the city has been relatively unscathed by Covid-19 infections and deaths. The street is classic east-end Toronto — three long blocks of houses huddled together, as if for warmth. It was once part of a 600-acre farm owned by the Ashbridges, an English Quaker family from Pennsylvania who fled to Canada as Loyalists after the American Revolution. It remained a farm outside the city limits for more than a century, until the land was parceled and sold off — for shacks for the immigrating poor and for planned subdivisions. Walking down the street, you can see the signs of that history in the architecture — old working-class bungalows wedged beside gentrified two-story brick homes. You can also see locals homesteading in ways that Sarah Ashbridge, the matriarch of the Quaker settlers, would likely recognize. Ms. Ois is known locally as the “fer-mentor.” On her stove, a pot of water, grated ginger and molasses cools next to her “ginger bug” — the makings for ginger ale. Her slow cooker is warming milk for yogurt. She pulls colorful jars out of her “fermenting cupboard” — homemade vinegars, kombuchas and pickles. For many years, she bugged her neighbors to try her hobby, but they were too busy, rushing from work to children’s hockey practices. When the country went into lockdown in March, she found a captive audience with long days to fill and anxiety to expend. “When this all happened, everyone else came into my world,” said Ms. Ois, 43, a stay-at-home parent. “Many said, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ Well, I know what to do. I’m an expert at it.” She offered kombucha scobies, sourdough starter, and seeds for her neighbors’ nascent vegetable patches. She left them all in the wagon on her front porch, and texted pictures of her handwritten recipes. Just down the street, Guillermo del Aguila had set up a hydroponics nursery in his basement for the first time, to supply the seedlings for his family’s backyard greenhouse. He was better at it than he expected. He joined in the exchange, issuing his own community offerings: eggplant, sweet pepper, tomato and leek seedlings. Jon Harris lives a few doors down. Both he and his wife had been deemed essential workers, so time had not stopped still for them. But he found making bread soothing. The baking section of grocery store shelves was bare, but he knew of a commercial mill and put out a call to the street. His first order was for 300 kilograms of flour and 25 pounds of yeast. “There’s something magical happening,” said Mr. Harris, 44, an electrician. He added, “I wonder if there is something about watching the world spin around you and thinking about your mortality. We have a little more space to grab onto the things we want to be important.” The trading and pioneer hobbies have continued, even as the city has begun slowly to open up. Ms. Ois set up a swap page on Facebook, and offers went up from neighbors for homemade granola, freezer strawberry jam, lavender, eggs, espresso syrup, bitters for cocktails. Deborah MacDonald ventured to the red wagon to pick up champagne yeast to make raspberry mead, with Ms. Ois’s handwritten recipe. She left fresh-baked bread. “I used to joke I didn’t know anybody on the street,” said Ms. MacDonald, a film producer who often clocked 11-hour days at the office. While there was a sense of community before, many of her neighbors barely knew each other before the virus stitched their friendships. “We’ve all helped each other get through this crazy time,” said Ms. MacDonald. “In some respects it’s allowed us to forget a little about all the terrible.” Ms. Ois’s husband hammered together a greenhouse in their backyard that she called “the house Covid built.” She and the del Aguila family plan to grow seedlings for their neighbors’ bursting gardens next spring. “There’s no going back,” said Kara del Aguila, Guillermo’s wife, who considers the street her “precious lifeline.” “We don’t order flowers for delivery anymore,” she said. “We go to our neighbors’ homes and knock on the front door and give them something we made.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized again this week — this time for taking part in a decision to award a no-bid government contract to a charity deeply connected to his family. The country’s ethics commissioner is digging into the affair, marking the third time Mr. Trudeau has been investigated for breaking conflict-of-interest rules since coming to power in 2015.

"South Korean Lawsuit Filed Against Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s Sister",2020-07-17,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — After North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office on its own soil last month, plunging relations with South Korea to a diplomatic nadir, a conservative activist lawyer in the South decided that one person was responsible: Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. So he filed a lawsuit against Ms. Kim. South Korean prosecutors said on Friday that they were looking into the litigation, but it was not clear whether they would begin a formal investigation. Their hands appeared to be tied: They have practically no way to summon Mr. Kim’s sister to court to face the accusation. The suit is largely symbolic, but if it triggers an angry reaction from the North, it could lead to the further deterioration of the relationship between the two Koreas. The activist lawyer, Lee Kyung-jae, a vocal critic of Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, told reporters last \u200bweek \u200bthat he had been driven to file the lawsuit in part because the government of Mr. Moon had not been aggressive enough in dealing with the North’s destruction of the liaison office. Inter-Korean relations were warmer in 2018, when Mr. Kim held summit meetings with President Moon, who helped arrange meetings between Mr. Kim and President Trump. But ties turned frosty once Mr. Kim’s second meeting with Mr. Trump, held in Vietnam in February 2019, collapsed. Tension mounted between the two Koreas as Ms. Kim became the hard-line face and voice of North Korea. After activists in the South sent anti-North Korean leaflets \u200b over the border into the North, she issued a series of statements threatening retaliation — including the destruction of the liaison office. The North Korean military did blow up the office last month, which is in the border city of Kaesong, North Korea. But her brother later suspended any further military actions aimed at scuttling the relatively warm relationship that had developed between the two Koreas in recent years. Last week, Mr. Lee filed the lawsuit asking prosecutors to indict Ms. Kim, along with Pak Jong-chon, chief of the general staff of the North Korean military, on charges of destroying a building constructed with South Korean taxpayer’s money. A legal complaint in South Korea is generally assigned to a prosecutor to decide whether it merits a full investigation. Prosecutors usually suspend attempts to indict criminal suspects when they cannot be brought to court. Even Mr. Lee acknowledged that there was no way for prosecutors to present Ms. Kim in a court in the South. The lawsuit against Ms. Kim comes on the heels of a landmark ruling this month in a civil suit filed on behalf of two South Korean prisoners of war from the 1950-53 Korean War. With the help of conservative lawyers, the men, who spent decades in the North before escaping to the South, won their case when a Seoul court ordered Kim Jong-un and North Korea to compensate them for the forced labor they suffered while in the North. Under South Korea’s Constitution, North Korea and its people are technically part of South Korea. \u200b And in South Korea, civil lawsuits can be tried without the defendants in court. The ruling in the P.O.W. case ruling was also largely symbolic because there was no way South Korea can force Mr. Kim and North Korea to pay the compensation. \u200bStill, it encouraged politically active conservative lawyers to file or consider other lawsuits against North Korea over a host of issues, such as the widespread abuse of human rights. On Friday, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said it had stripped two refugee groups of their licenses as legal entities because sending leaflets over the border endangered the lives of nearby villagers by raising tensions with North Korea and was not part of what they said they would do when getting the licenses. Without the licenses, the two groups cannot raise funds through donations and other means. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek criminal charges against Ms. Kim. But given past practices, they will most likely drop the case after studying the complaint. In the past, activists had sued top North Korean leaders, like Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, over incidents like the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010. But prosecutors indicted no one.']","The litigation, for the destruction of the inter-Korean liaison office, is largely symbolic because there is no way for prosecutors to bring Ms. Kim to court."
Police Officers Found Guilty in Acid Attack. But Doubts Remain.,2020-07-16,By Dera Menra Sijabat and Richard C. Paddock,"['JAKARTA, Indonesia — An anticorruption investigator, Novel Baswedan, was walking home from his neighborhood mosque in Jakarta three years ago when two men approached by motorbike and threw acid in his face. The attack left him blind in one eye and half-blind in the other. On Thursday evening, a court found two police officers, Rahmat Kadir Mahulette and Ronny Bugis, guilty of carrying out the April 2017 attack. But Mr. Novel, 43, a senior investigator for Indonesia’s respected Corruption Eradication Commission, believes the attack was ordered by someone more powerful, someone he investigated — but he doesn’t know who. Mr. Novel is widely seen by the public as a hero for his willingness to investigate leading politicians and police officials, including several who have gone to prison, in a campaign to root out the high-level corruption that has plagued Indonesia for decades. He and his supporters contend that the two low-ranking officers were merely lackeys or scapegoats, and that their arrest and prosecution was aimed at relieving pressure on the police to find whoever ordered the assault. Before the attack, the officers had no apparent connection to Mr. Novel or interest in the activities of the anti-corruption commission. “The investigation of this crime should not stop with just these two defendants,” Mr. Novel’s lawyers said in a statement Wednesday before the verdict was announced. “We believe that there is a mastermind behind this crime who the police do not want to reveal.” In a statement posted to Twitter on Friday, Mr. Novel criticized Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, for not ensuring that the police conducted a thorough investigation to find those responsible for the attack.  Mr. Novel suggested that the unidentified mastermind remains at large and could be prepared to strike again.  “The lesson is that Indonesia is really dangerous for people who fight corruption,” he wrote. During the trial, Mr. Mahulette admitted in court that he had thrown the acid at Mr. Novel, and said he viewed the investigator — a former police officer — as a “traitor” because he investigated police officials. Prosecutors said Mr. Mahulette was motivated in part by Mr. Novel’s role in what by then was a four-year-old case, the conviction of Police Inspector General Djoko Susilo in an equipment procurement scandal. Prosecutors made the case that Mr. Mahulette intended to teach Mr. Novel a lesson by splashing sulfuric acid on his body but accidentally hit him in the face. The  assertion that the acid struck Mr. Novel’s face by accident prompted widespread ridicule on social media last month. Mr. Novel and his legal team have criticized the prosecutors, saying that they failed to present evidence found at the scene or to call three known eyewitnesses to testify. A three-judge panel sentenced Mr. Mahulette to two years in prison and Mr. Ronny, who drove the motorbike used in the attack, to 18 months. The prosecution had sought a one-year sentence for each. Mr. Novel’s legal team and human rights advocates called on President Joko to form an independent commission to investigate the attack. “It was a show trial,” said Usman Hamid, Amnesty International’s executive director for Indonesia. “For Novel and many of us who have been following the case closely, the trial is seemingly designed to sway public opinion rather than to ensure justice.” The attack on Mr. Novel caused widespread public outrage, and a lack of progress in the case was a lingering embarrassment for the police until the two officers were arrested in December. Mr. Novel told reporters after the attack that he had investigated so many powerful people that it was hard for him to know who among them might have sought revenge. Mr. Novel underwent repeated surgeries to repair his left eye, which turned white from the acid. The judges, in their 232-page statement of findings, said that he had lost all vision in that eye and half the vision in his right eye. As a mitigating factor in sentencing, the judges noted that Mr. Mahulette had watered down the sulfuric acid rather than using it at full strength because he did not intend to cause severe injury. The judges took turns reading aloud their findings, verdict and sentence, which took more than eight hours in all. The Corruption Eradication Commission was established in 2003. It is widely credited with success and is held in higher esteem than most other institutions in the country, including the police and the judiciary, which are seen as riddled with corruption. The president, Mr. Joko, triggered widespread protests last year when he moved to curb the agency’s autonomy by installing a supervisory board and limiting the commission’s power to wiretap suspects and hire independent staff members. Dera Menra Sijabat reported from Jakarta and Richard C. Paddock reported from Bangkok.']","The target of the 2017 attack, a corruption investigator in Indonesia who lost most of his sight, and supporters say officials have shown little interest in finding who was really behind it."
Statue of Black Protester Is Raised in Place of Bristol Slave Trader,2020-07-15,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Jen Reid had never marched in a Black Lives Matter protest before she took to the streets of Bristol, England, on June 7. By the end of that angry day, she had clambered up to stand in the place of a 17th-century slave trader, whose bronze statue had been pulled down and dumped in the city’s harbor. The image of Ms. Reid, her fist clenched, her right arm thrust upward in a gesture of defiance, spread widely on social media. For many, it seemed the perfect replacement for the notorious merchant, Edward Colston — a flesh-and-blood rebuke to the trader’s cruel legacy, which still hangs over modern Bristol. At dawn on Wednesday morning, Ms. Reid was up there again in the form of a resin-and-steel sculpture by Marc Quinn. A prominent British sculptor known for his provocative works, Mr. Quinn said that when he saw the image of Ms. Reid on the plinth, he sensed the opportunity for an act of guerrilla art. He got in touch with Ms. Reid and proposed a clandestine project, in which she would pose for a sculpture that he would install where the Colston statue had stood. Working with a team of 10 people, Mr. Quinn swiftly erected the piece without the approval of city authorities. How long it will be allowed to stay there was not clear. “She created this iconic image,” Mr. Quinn said in an interview. “I’m just amplifying the moment she created.” He said he viewed the sculpture as a complement to the protests, one that he hoped would provoke debate about “how we commemorate people in statues.” While he said he did not expect city officials to leave the work in place permanently, he hoped they would leave it long enough to prompt a conversation. Ms. Reid, who works as a fashion stylist, said she found it “surreal” to have an artist memorialize her spontaneous decision to climb up on the plinth, a moment she recalls with a mix of exhilaration and fear, given her worries about falling off. “Looking back on that moment, it just gives me goose-pimples,” she said. “Marc has just captured all of it in the statue.” Even before that moment, Ms. Reid said she had misgivings about going to the march. She is taking care of aging parents and was worried about the risk of contracting the coronavirus in the crowds. But her outrage at the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis overrode her trepidation, she said, and she decided to go, even buying a black beret and glove for the occasion. Ms. Reid and her husband, Alasdair Doggart, listened to speeches before joining a march to the site of the Colston statue. After they watched the crowd tear it down and dump it in the water, the couple returned to the empty plinth, where — helped up by Mr. Doggart — she stood on the plinth and struck her pose. “It wasn’t as easy as it looked because it was a lot higher than I thought it was,” Ms. Reid said. “My legs were jelly. It was a slow rise, but when I stood up and raised my fist, the crowd cheered like crazy.” Mr. Doggart snapped a photo, which he posted on his Instagram account. The next morning, after a colleague of Mr. Quinn’s showed it to him, he called Ms. Reid and proposed the project. She traveled to a film production studio outside London and recreated the pose for Mr. Quinn, who arrayed 200 cameras to shoot her from every angle. After he made a three-dimensional scan, Mr. Quinn created the sculpture from resin. Working in bronze, he said, would have added several months to the project, and he wanted to install the piece while memories of that day were fresh. Mr. Quinn is part of a cohort of British visual artists, known as Young British Artists, or Y.B.A.s, who came to prominence in the 1980s. The group, which includes Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, is known for the shock value of their works, like Mr. Hirst’s display of a shark preserved in formaldehyde. Mr. Quinn’s best known work is a cast of his head, made from his own frozen blood. He also drew attention for a marble sculpture, “Alison Lapper Pregnant,” which depicted a woman with a condition that left her with no arms and shortened legs. It was placed on a plinth in Trafalgar Square in London from 2005 to 2007. “I’m interested in how society is moving, and bringing it into the world of art, which is kind of antiseptic,” Mr. Quinn said. “It’s because I’m a successful artist, I can get this up. It’s a temporary sentence in the conversation.” The debate over what should permanently replace the Colston statue has percolated since last month. Historians have suggested a statue of Paul Stephenson, a Black activist who organized a successful boycott of a Bristol bus company in the 1960s. A mannequin of Jimmy Savile, the disgraced BBC television host — dressed in a blonde wig and neon tracksuit — was placed on the plinth for a few days. As for the statue of Colston, Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, ordered it fished out of the harbor and stored for safekeeping while the public debates what to do with it. It is likely to end up in a local museum that has an exhibit about Bristol’s links to the slave trade. Mr. Rees has gotten plenty of other suggestions already. Banksy, the elusive street artist who became famous for his graffiti paintings on the sides of buildings in Bristol, posted a sketch on Instagram of a proposed memorial depicting Colston in the act of being toppled, with protesters tugging on ropes around his neck. For Ms. Reid, a descendant of Jamaican immigrants, the debate over the statue symbolized Bristol’s reluctance to confront the sinister past of one of its biggest benefactors. Colston’s name is still on a school, a performing arts center and several other institutions in the city, though some are in the process of removing it. “I walked past his statue every day for the last five years,” she said. “It’s an effrontery to have a slave master you have to walk past everyday.” Ms. Reid said she had no idea whether the city would let the statue of her stay in place for several months — or a single day. But she confessed to being tickled about being a part of Bristol’s urban landscape in a time of social change. “I’ll tell people to meet me by my statue,” she said laughing.']","The image of Jen Reid, fist clenched atop the plinth in the English city where Edward Colston once stood, became a symbol of protest online.

"As U.S. Coronavirus Cases Hit 3.5 Million, Officials Scramble to Add Restrictions",2020-07-15,,"['Follow our live updates of coronavirus cases and deaths globally. The United States on Wednesday reported more than 67,300 new infections across the country, according to a New York Times database. It was the nation’s second-highest single-day total and roughly 1,000 cases shy of the record set last week. The U.S. outbreak, which has increased in 41 states over the past two weeks, hit 3.5 million total infections on Wednesday, the Times’s database shows. Alabama and Idaho set single-day death records, and officials in Arizona announced 101 deaths, tying that state’s daily record. In a cautionary effort, several large school districts said on Wednesday that they would open the year with online classes, bucking pressure from President Trump and his administration to get students back into classrooms as quickly as possible. The Houston Independent School District, the seventh-largest in the country, said it would start the year virtually on Sept. 8. Students will have at least six weeks of online instruction, with a tentative plan to start in-person classes on Oct. 19. In San Francisco, school officials announced that the upcoming school year would start with distance learning and that the district would “gradually phase in a staggered return” to the classroom. In a message to parents, the superintendent,  Vincent Matthews, wrote that “we hope to provide a gradual hybrid approach (a combination of in-person and distance learning) for some students when science and data suggest it is safe to do so.” Officials in Prince George’s County, Md., announced that students would be distance-learning through at least February. The announcements came a week after Mr. Trump threatened to cut federal funding for school systems that defied his demand to reopen classrooms, and after he pressured the government’s top public health experts to water down recommendations for how schools could reopen safely. Los Angeles and San Diego, the two largest public school districts in California, announced this week that instruction would be online only in the fall. Now, 11 of the 15 largest districts in California have said that they will reopen with 100 percent remote instruction. New York City, which has the largest school district in the nation, is planning a mix of in-person and remote learning, with students expected to return to classrooms from one to three days a week. Some governors and school districts are pressing ahead with plans to reopen classrooms, however. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, is urging school districts to give parents the option of sending their children to school five days a week. In Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, announced that she would delay the opening of schools by several weeks, until after Labor Day, saying that schools needed time to get masks, thermometers, hand sanitizer and other supplies. “I can’t in good conscience open schools when Kansas has numerous hot spots where cases are at an all-time high & continuing to rapidly rise,” she wrote on Twitter. As the U.S. outbreak increased in 41 states over the past two weeks and reached 3.5 million total infections on Wednesday, according to a New York Times database, governors and mayors across the nation have scrambled to respond, issuing new mask orders, limiting the size of gatherings and preparing for things to get much worse in the coming weeks. But in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, on Wednesday specifically forbade local officials to require people to wear face coverings in public even as he extended his executive order limiting the size of public gatherings to 50. The order, which was set to expire at midnight, will now last until July 31. It says people are “strongly encouraged” to wear face coverings outside their homes. According to The Associated Press, the ban on local face-mask requirements would affect orders by at least 15 local governments in the state. The state’s seven-day average of new cases jumped to nearly 3,000 on Tuesday from 1,900 on July 1. Hospitalizations in the state have also been rising, and the governor said last week that a shuttered temporary hospital at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta would be reopened. In Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, on Wednesday issued an order requiring people to wear masks in public. The state on Wednesday reported 47 deaths, its record for a single day. In Montana, Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, said that he was also issuing a mask order. The private sector took steps as well: Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said it would require all customers to wear masks, beginning on Monday. The grocery chain Kroger also said its customers had to to wear masks starting July 22. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, warned of “an unsettling climb” in new cases and moved to reduce seating capacity in restaurants and to limit the size of gatherings. And in Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, said that she was willing to reverse course and tighten restrictions again. “I won’t just turn the car around,” she said. “I’m going to shut it off, I’m going to kick you out and I’m going to make you walk home.” Oklahoma hit a single-day record for cases on Wednesday, with 1,075, and the state’s governor, Kevin Stitt, announced that he had tested positive, becoming the first governor known to be infected with the coronavirus. Mr. Stitt, a Republican, has attended many public events and has often been photographed in public while not wearing a mask, including at an indoor rally for President Trump that was held in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20. He said that he did not know where, when or how he had contracted the virus, and that his infection had not prompted him to second-guess his response to the outbreak. On Wednesday, Florida became the third state — after New York and California — to surpass 300,000 total cases. Its governor, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, says the state will deploy 1,000 medical workers to hospitals that have beds for coronavirus patients but not enough doctors and nurses to treat them.  Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, gave an evening address on the virus in which he warned Ohioans that if they did not act to curb the recent uptick in cases, “Florida and Arizona will be our future.” “Now let’s be honest, all of us — all of us — have started to let our guard down,” he said. “I know I have. We’re tired. We want to go back to the way things were, and that’s very, very understandable. But when we do, we’re literally playing a Russian roulette game with our own lives, and our families’, and our neighbors.’” China’s economy expanded 3.2 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year, officials said on Thursday. The recovery is a sign, with caveats, of the authoritarian government’s success in bringing the outbreak under control with widespread testing and travel restrictions. By contrast, economies in Europe and the United States are still languishing as the pandemic forces cities to shut down and shoppers to stay home. China’s growth from April through June is an abrupt turnaround from first quarter, when its economy shrank 6.8 percent, the first contraction that the government has acknowledged in nearly half a century. The new figures partly reflect the restrictions that China imposed after its early missteps delayed the response to the outbreak and fed public anger, as well as the government’s continued reliance on infrastructure spending instead of domestic consumption. But all the recent spending on highways and rail lines raises questions about whether China’s economic turnaround is sustainable and whether it can become the engine needed to drive the global economy out of a slump. Factories in China are already cranking out furniture, consumer electronics and mass-market cars more quickly than consumers at home or abroad want to buy them. “It looks like there is still a mismatch there — people are not consuming as much as previously,” said Sara Hsu, a visiting scholar in economics at Fudan University in Shanghai. Sales of groceries and other essentials have stayed strong in China throughout the pandemic, but people’s willingness to spend money on restaurant meals and other nonessential goods and services has still not fully bounced back. Tens of millions of Chinese, particularly young people, also remain out of work, and the slowdown caused by the pandemic has widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Asian stocks were down on Thursday after China released its economic data. Chinese equities fell about 1.5 percept, and markets slipped in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. The official China Film Administration also said in a notice on Thursday that movie theaters in the Chinese mainland would gradually reopen starting next Monday. Bookings will be limited, and theaters will be regularly disinfected, the notice said. As Trump administration officials have increasingly sought to undermine him in recent days, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and one of the most trusted federal officials working on the pandemic, made his most pointed remarks yet on Wednesday addressing tensions with the White House. “I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,” Dr. Fauci said in an interview with The Atlantic on Wednesday. “I think they realize now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it’s only reflecting negatively on them.” He spoke as Trump administration officials have sought to undermine his credibility — first anonymously, over the weekend, and then out in the open. A short op-ed by Peter Navarro, the president’s top trade adviser, published in USA Today on Tuesday evening was headlined “Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.” Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff for communications, posted a cartoon Sunday evening mocking Dr. Fauci. In the interview Wednesday, Dr. Fauci called the partisan environment around the virus disturbing. “It distracts from what I hope would be the common effort of getting this thing under control, rather than this back-and-forth distraction, which just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. Asked to review the government’s response to the pandemic, he said: “We’ve got to almost reset this and say, OK, let’s stop this nonsense and figure out how can we get our control over this now, and looking forward, how can we make sure that next month, we don’t have another example of California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, because those are the hot zones now, and I’m looking at the map, saying we got to make sure it doesn’t happen in other states.” “So rather than these games people are playing,” he said, “let’s focus on that.” Mr. Trump put some distance between himself and his aide’s op-ed piece, saying, “I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.” Others in the administration went further than the president. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters Wednesday that the administration “couldn’t be more grateful” for Dr. Fauci’s “steady counsel.” Alyssa Farah, the White House director for strategic communications, wrote on Twitter. ““The Peter Navarro op-ed didn’t go through normal White House clearance processes and is the opinion of Peter alone.” Drug deaths in the United States, which in 2018 fell for the first time in 25 years, rose to record numbers in 2019 and are continuing to climb, a resurgence that appears related to some of the hardships created by the coronavirus outbreak. Drug deaths have risen an average of 13 percent so far in 2020 compared with last year, according to mortality data collected by The New York Times. If this trend continues for the rest of the year, the increase in annual drug deaths will be the sharpest since 2016. Several public health experts said conditions created by the pandemic could hurt the nation’s fragile progress in fighting drug-related deaths, but they noted that the overdose rate was on its way back up well before the virus arrived. “Covid just makes it a bit worse,” said Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Researchers say the threat of overdose can be exacerbated by the social-isolation practices used to contain the virus. Aside from the emotional effects, there are practical dangers: Using drugs alone means there is no one around if a revival attempt is needed. The vast curtailment of in-person medical treatment — including group counseling sessions and stays at residential treatment centers — means there is far less of the emotional support that can be vital to addiction treatment. Global Roundup Women of color have long faced economic and racial inequality in Britain. Now that group is being hit disproportionately by the financial and psychological impact of the pandemic, according to a recent study by a group of British universities and women’s charities. The survey found that nearly 43 percent of Black and ethnic minority women believed that they would be in more debt than before the pandemic, compared with 37 percent of white women and 34 percent of white men. More than four in 10 of the women said they would struggle to make ends meet over the next three months. A government review of the disparities in the risk and outcomes from the coronavirus found that death rates have been higher in Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups than in white groups. The review found that Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and other Asians, as well as Caribbeans and other Black people, had from 10 percent to 50 percent higher risk of death than white Britons. In a recent study, Runnymede Trust, a think tank, found women of color were burdened with carrying out menial tasks that can be perilous in a pandemic. “Covid-19 has brought the harsh realities of pre-existing racial inequalities into sharp relief, and nowhere is this more manifest than the disproportionate social and economic impact of Covid-19 on Black and ethnic minority women,” said Zubaida Haque, the interim director of Runnymede. In other news from around the world: India reported 32,695 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, its highest single-day caseload yet. Several Indian states are reintroducing social distancing measures that they lifted in June, and the country’s total caseload — the world’s third-largest, after the United States and Brazil — is nearing one million. Tokyo was expected to report a single-day record of more than 280 new cases on Thursday, Japan’s national broadcaster reported. The authorities in the Philippines have empowered the police to fan out home-to-home in search of infected people, triggering an uproar among human rights groups. Childhood vaccination rates have plunged during the pandemic, and the World Health Organization warned that the long-term effects from missed inoculations could be worse than Covid-19. Black business owners are more likely to be hindered in seeking coronavirus financial aid than their white peers, a new study has found. The study looked at how more than a dozen Washington-area banks handled requests for loans under the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program. It was conducted by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit in Washington, in partnership with researchers from universities in Utah and New Jersey. From late April to late May, the researchers and the nonprofit, which supports better access to capital for low-income and minority communities, sent pairs of would-be loan applicants to branches of 17 banks. In each pair, a Black borrower and a white borrower shared similar credit and asset characteristics, so the only difference between them was their race. To make the study more conservative, the researchers gave each Black borrower a slightly better financial profile than his or her white counterpart. The Black borrowers were offered different products and treated significantly worse by employees than white borrowers were in 43 percent of the tests, the study found. Of the 17 banks, some of which were tested through multiple branches, 13 had at least one test in which a white borrower was treated better than his or her Black counterpart. In the rest of the tests, the pairs were treated relatively equally or the difference wasn’t significant enough to count as a violation of fair lending laws, in the researchers’ view. Myanmar will soon adopt rules that would permit captive breeding of about 175 threatened species, including tigers, pangolins and Irrawaddy dolphins, despite fears that such ventures could encourage the poaching of wild animals and spawn new diseases that jump to humans. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation quietly circulated a list of wildlife last month that could be raised commercially for display in zoos, tourist attractions or hotels and, in a handful of cases, to produce meat for sale to the public. Officials say the list is aimed at improving wildlife protection by reducing illegal hunting and increasing conservation under an existing law. But international conservation groups said the plan could undermine wildlife protection by increasing demand for wild meat and for species used in traditional medicine. Keeping wildlife for human consumption, especially in crowded Asian markets, has been linked to viruses that have infected humans, including the coronavirus that has caused the current pandemic and the one that caused SARS, which emerged in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide. “Commercial wildlife breeding and trade can also increase the risk of disease spillover from wildlife to humans, such as Covid-19,” the World Wildlife Fund and Fauna and Flora International said. The pangolin, which at one point was suspected of playing a part in the transmission of the new coronavirus, could be bred in Myanmar zoos under the new regulations. It is far from certain that pangolins were involved in the emergence of the new coronavirus. Pangolins do host similar viruses, but a virus found in intermediate horseshoe bats is closer to the one that causes Covid-19. In addition, none of the viruses carried by pangolins are similar enough to the new coronavirus to indicate a direct spillover to humans, and there has been no clear transmission path established from bats to pangolins. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert H. Redfield, defended the Trump administration’s decision to strip the C.D.C. of control of some of the nation’s key coronavirus data, saying on Wednesday that the move was necessary to modernize data collection. On a conference call with reporters, Dr. Redfield said the C.D.C. was looking for ways to make its coronavirus data more “externally facing,” so that Americans could examine “the current extent of the pandemic in different counties and in different ZIP codes.” The administration’s new directive instructs hospitals to report coronavirus information directly to a new central database at the Department of Human Health and Services in Washington, rather than to the C.D.C. in Atlanta, which has been collecting the information since the start of the pandemic and which prides itself on scientific independence. The directive to bypass the C.D.C. has provoked an uproar among public health experts. Researchers, state health officials and academics rely on the C.D.C.’s data, and expressed concern about whether Health and Human Services, the parent agency of the C.D.C., would be as transparent as the C.D.C. has been. The new database, called H.H.S. Protect, is not public. Experts including Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida and a former health secretary, accused the administration of trying to politicize the data by taking control of it away from the C.D.C. Jose Arrietta, the chief information officer for Health and Human Services, said on Wednesday that the new database would feed information to the C.D.C., which would continue to issue reports on the pandemic. Mr. Arrieta said the health agency is considering giving members of Congress access to the new database, and is “exploring the best way” to make information from it available to news organizations, academic researchers and the general public. Temperatures have been soaring across the South and the Southwest, reaching record highs in areas grappling with some of the worst virus outbreaks in the nation — making it more difficult to protect people who are at risk from extreme heat. San Antonio hit 106 degrees on Monday, tying the July record. Monitors at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport hit a blazing 114, matching the old record. Austin hit a high of 108 degrees — three degrees above the old record. Such heat can disproportionally affect the vulnerable: people without the means to buy an air-conditioner or crank it up to full blast. Cities typically open cooling centers, in places like community recreation centers, where people can escape the heat. But the virus has introduced complications in a moment when people are being discouraged from congregating indoors. Austin’s cooling centers now require visitors to maintain social distancing and to wear masks, said Matthew Lara, a spokesman for the city’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. “You don’t want to cram 30 people into a room and call it a cooling center,” he said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service said that the most punishing heat would begin to abate across the South, but, like a hot bubble under the nation’s wallpaper, “will be on the increase for the eastern U.S. and for the northern High Plains.” A pair of recent studies found that people with Type A blood are no more at risk of getting the virus or falling dangerously ill than others, contradicting preliminary evidence based on a relatively small sample of people. Over the past few months, after looking at thousands of additional patients with Covid-19, scientists are reporting a much weaker link to blood type. Two studies — one at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the other at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York — did not find that Type A blood increases the odds that people will be infected. The new reports do find evidence that people with Type O blood may be slightly less likely to be infected. But the effect is so small that people shouldn’t count on it. “No one should think they’re protected,” said Nicholas Tatonetti, a data scientist at Columbia University. Even if blood types don’t matter much for treating people with Covid-19, they could reveal something important about the basic nature of the disease. That’s because blood type influences how your immune system fights against infections. People with Type A blood do not make the same kind of antibodies as people with Type B blood, for example. It is conceivable that these molecular differences in the immune system explain the purported link between blood type and coronavirus infections. Pressure is mounting to close Grand Canyon and other national parks in states across the South and the West that are seeing rising cases. When the pandemic took hold in the United States this spring, many local public health officials demanded that national parks close, arguing that the millions of tourists they attract endangered vulnerable people in adjacent towns and tribal lands, often-remote places with hospitals miles away. After shutting down on April 1, Grand Canyon partially reopened in time for summer tourist season. In some ways, the parks provide a refuge from the pandemic. Experts say the risk of catching the virus is much lower outdoors. Camping offers a cheap, socially distanced vacation for families, and some parks are in sparsely populated areas with fewer cases. But as the virus infiltrates growing sections of the country, some lawmakers are questioning the decision to keep parks open even partially. The government in the Philippines has empowered the police to fan out home-to-home in search of infected people. The move has triggered an uproar among human rights groups, which on Wednesday accused President Rodrigo Duterte’s government of employing repressive tactics. As the number of infected nears 60,000 nationwide, with the death toll surpassing 1,600, health authorities are under tremendous pressure from a public increasingly wary of Mr. Duterte, whose brutal anti-drugs campaign has left thousands dead. The policing plan, termed “Care Strategy,” lets officers accompany health workers in search of infected people who may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. The government said anyone who could not satisfy the requirements for home quarantine — including having their own bathroom and not living with elderly or pregnant people — are to be taken to a private facility. “This move reveals the Duterte government’s continuing reliance on police and militaristic approaches to solve a public health emergency,” said Ephraim Cortez, the secretary general of the National Union of People’s Lawyers, a group that provides counsel to the poor. A well-known Filipino human rights lawyer, Chel Diokno, said the government strategy would sow further terror. “Those with Covid are not police targets, they are medical patients,” Mr. Diokno said. “They should be treated with dignity and care.” Frustration over the lockdown exploded into violence in April, when frustrated and hungry people in an impoverished area of northern Manila took to the streets for an impromptu rally demanding government help. Riot police responded with force, violently dispersing the protest and sending some 21 people to jail. Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, on Tuesday compared the private facilities for patients to a “paid for vacation.” Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago warned on Wednesday that she is ready and willing to tighten restrictions in her city if cases continue to grow, citing bars that have broken capacity rules recently and new infections among young people. “I won’t just turn the car around,” she said. “I’m going to shut it off, I’m going to kick you out and I’m going to make you walk home.” Chicago is “on the precipice” of dangerous growth in cases, Ms. Lightfoot said. On Wednesday, the city reported 192 cases, the mayor said, though if the daily rate rose above 200, she would take steps to impose more restrictions. Beaches along Lake Michigan, normally a huge draw during the summer, have been closed and will remain closed indefinitely. Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois echoed Ms. Lightfoot’s note of caution on Wednesday. At a news conference, he said he was troubled by continuing outbreaks across the state, including those tied to parties, churches and youth sports. When officials see an outbreak that is especially concerning, Mr. Pritzker said, “we need to start tightening mitigations in that region before it’s too late.” As of Tuesday, Illinois had reported an average of 992 cases over seven days, and an average positive test rate of 3 percent over two weeks, according to data compiled by The Times and the Covid Tracking Project. As coronavirus cases surge in Victoria, Australia’s second-biggest state, officials there have barred people from gathering in large groups or traveling to most of the rest of the country. That has not stopped some fast-food aficionados, Pokémon Go players and train stowaways from trying. Four men in their twenties were discovered on an interstate freight train heading from Melbourne, Victoria’s capital, to Perth on the country’s west coast, officials said this week. They were found when officers with dogs searched the train during a stop in Adelaide, in South Australia. The men appeared in court on Wednesday and were released on the condition they do not commit further offenses for 12 months. Separately, six travelers from Victoria who were attempting to enter Queensland with false papers were fined a total of 24,000 Australian dollars ($16,700), the Queensland police said this week. Victoria Police’s deputy commissioner, Rick Nugent, also said that more than 500 fines totaling more than 880,000 Australian dollars ($560,000) had been issued to people caught breaking stay-at home orders or gathering inappropriately since Melbourne’s six-week lockdown began on July 9. Among the violators were two men caught playing the video game Pokémon Go outdoors, and others who were clients of sex workers and massage parlors. And 34 people were fined at a house party in Melbourne last week after the police were called there — twice — in response to noise complaints. In the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong, a suspiciously large KFC takeout order last week led police to more than a dozen people hiding at a house party and 26,000 Australian dollars in fines. Another man refused a police order to leave a KFC restaurant. On Wednesday, Mr. Nugent of the police department asked residents to abide by the new restrictions. “The time for discretion is over,” he said. Australia has recorded at least 10,200 confirmed cases and 110 deaths, according to a Times database; Victoria reported 238 new cases on Wednesday. Australia was initially praised for its response to the pandemic, but a second surge began creeping through Victoria last month and reaching parts of neighboring New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. New South Wales officials have said they would likely introduce new restrictions but stop short of imposing a strict lockdown. Childhood vaccination rates continue to plunge in the wake of the pandemic, and the World Health Organization warned that the fallout from missed vaccinations could end up being worse than Covid-19. “The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than Covid-19 itself,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general, said in a statement, Three quarters of the countries that responded to a new survey by the World Health Organization reported disruptions in immunization programs through May. The report, the second to show a drop in vaccinations because of the pandemic, said that at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns were or are at risk of being canceled. It added that other vaccine programs that require three doses, for diseases like diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, reported a substantial drop in the number of children who received vaccinations. “Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the history of public health, and more children are now being immunized than ever before,” Dr. Tedros said in the statement. “But the pandemic has put those gains at risk.” He added that vaccines can still be administered during the pandemic. The study, conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there are a variety of reasons more parents are not getting their children vaccinated. Some are reluctant to leave home, some face restrictions on movement, interruptions to transportation, economic hardships and the fear of exposure to the coronavirus. It also noted that many health workers have been redeployed to work on the pandemic, as well as a lack of protective equipment. The pandemic has taken a toll on pretty much everyone, pretty much everywhere. But it’s proving hard for some people to provide sympathy for one group in particular: Airbnb hosts. On Tuesday, the home-sharing giant messaged its users to say it had a new way to “connect with your favorite hosts.” The company said it was introducing “kindness cards” and the option to add a monetary contribution. “We hope these cards will make hosts smile, and bring a little joy your way,” the message read. Even though the pandemic has had a real impact on individual homeowners and smaller hotel operators who are struggling to make ends meet, the reaction was anything but joyful — instead it was a mix of mockery and surprise. “Flabbergasted that a company the size of @airbnb would solicit past customers for donations to hosts,” one Twitter user wrote. Other people shared the sentiment. “Airbnbs new strategy of sending me an email to ask me to send a “kindness card” to Airbnb hosts I’ve stayed with 3 years ago is just downright bizarre,” someone else tweeted. Airbnb itself has been struggling since the pandemic started crippling the travel industry. In April, the company said it had raised $1 billion in new funding to stockpile cash to deal with the consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. The following month, Airbnb said it would lay off a quarter of its staff. But while Airbnb is asking its users to send some love to their former hosts, a more tangible piece of news emerged on Tuesday as well: In what could be an early sign of recovery as lockdowns ease in places around the globe, Airbnb said people had made more than 1 million reservations on the platform on July 8, Reuters reported, a number that had not been seen since early March. The graffiti artist Banksy unveiled some virus-themed art when he appeared to spray-paint images of rats on the inside of a London Underground train. “If you don’t mask — you don’t get,” said the caption of a post by his Instagram account this week that featured video footage of the spray painting. The BBC reported that art was removed by cleaners.

‘Forest Rambo’ Eludes German Police 3 Days Into Sprawling Hunt,2020-07-15,By Christopher F. Schuetze,"['BERLIN — The call to the German police on Sunday seemed a bit odd but routine enough. A man armed with a bow and arrow had been squatting illegally in a small shed outside the village of Oppenau in the foothills of the Black Forest. When four officers arrived, Yves Etienne Rausch, 31, greeted them calmly while seated behind a table in the red shed. He handed over his bow and arrow, and a spear that was by his side. But when officers asked to search him, he drew a gun, threatened one policeman at point blank range and demanded their weapons. Then he ran. And for three days and three nights he has evaded capture despite a manhunt that has involved more than 1,500 police officers and attracted a growing online following. A Facebook page set up in his honor has more than a thousand subscribers and the manhunt has become a running story in Germany’s tabloids, which refer to Mr. Rausch as “Forest Rambo.” The search has turned into an embarrassment for the highly trained and well-equipped state police, who have admitted that they are at a disadvantage against a single foe who had extensive local knowledge and the ability to survive for an extended period of time in the 2,100-acre forest. “The forest is his living room. That’s why — given the impassible and at times steep terrain — it is difficult for us to find him quickly,” said the Offenburg police commissioner Reinhard Renter at a news conference on Tuesday, noting that the police had time on their side. The police blocked roads and briefly closed schools and day care centers in the area as they pursued at least 140 tips. A steady stream of police special forces, helicopters and mobile SWAT teams have swarmed the picturesque mountains around the village of 1,600 in southern Germany near the French border. On Monday alone, 440 officers were looking for Mr. Rausch. Mr. Rausch is now wanted for “aggravated predatory extortion” for the four guns he took from the police, a charge with a minimum sentence of five years of prison; a local judge issued both national and European Union-wide arrest warrants. Known as an eccentric character by locals, who say he often wore a heavy black coat even on the hottest days, Mr. Rausch did not have a reputation as being dangerous. “I know him to be polite, friendly and pleasant,” one local told the SWR, the region’s public broadcaster. But he did have a criminal history. Mr. Rausch spent more than three years in jail for severely injuring a friend with a crossbow after an argument. In the 2010 sentencing, the judge took into account that Mr. Rausch had tried to help his victim and called for medical help after shooting. He also has a police record in connection with car break-ins and petty theft, according to the local state attorney, Herwig Schäfer. In a recent photo Mr. Rausch, who is 5 foot 6 inches tall, is seen in military fatigues wearing an equipment vest, a gas mask and night vision goggles. Police say there are no indications that Mr. Rausch is acting out of a political motive. On Wednesday hundreds of police were still actively searching for Mr. Rausch and weighing options. One possible change of strategy: using the police helicopters’ loudspeakers to broadcast messages to Mr. Rausch in the hope that he gives himself up. “Given his personality, it is also possible that he gives himself up,” said Mr. Renter, who is leading the search, “That he just says he’s done with it; that he says he can’t deal with this situation.”']","A squatter armed with bow and arrow, spear and gun overpowered four officers and fled into the Black Forest on Sunday.

Tunisian Woman Sentenced to Prison Over Joke Alluding to the Quran,2020-07-17,By Lilia Blaise and Elian Peltier,"['TUNIS — As Tunisia battled the coronavirus pandemic in May, and millions in the North African country found themselves confined to their homes, a lighthearted Facebook post about the virus caught Emna Chargui’s eye and brought a brief moment of laughter in a period of uncertainty. The “Sourate Corona,” a design that appears to have been created in France, delivered a simple “wash your hands” message framed in recognizable green contours and adorned with virus symbols, mimicking the style of Quranic verse. Ms. Chargui, 27, shared the post. But what was meant as a simple quip about the outbreak has become a fight for Ms. Chargui’s freedom of expression that could result in a prison sentence. This week, Ms. Chargui was found guilty of “inciting hatred between religions,” and sentenced to six months in jail and a $700 fine for the post, in a case that has raised questions about the extent to which freedom of speech is protected in the country. Hundreds have now shared the same image along with the hashtag #FreeEmnaChargui in solidarity with the young woman. Ms. Chargui’s case has drawn little attention in the country, aside from rights groups calling for her release: The coronavirus pandemic dominates the news cycle, along with the abrupt resignation on Wednesday of the prime minister, Elyes Fakhfakh, just months after he was sworn into office. But rights organizations have warned that the ruling against Ms. Chargui could set a dangerous precedent in a country that has been hailed as a rare example of democratic success since the Arab Spring in 2011, but where discussions of religion  remain taboo. Ahmed Benchemsi, the communications director for Human Rights Watch in the Middle East and North Africa, called the ruling a “setback for freedom of expression in a country that has otherwise made great strides on the path to democracy.” Tunisia, which enforced a nationwide lockdown and closed its borders in mid-March, has fared better than some of its neighbors in containing the spread of the coronavirus, with 50 deaths and 1,326 confirmed cases as of Friday. Ms. Chargui said she had received hundreds of death threats and threats of sexual violence since she first shared the image. “I thought it was a good way to make people aware about washing their hands and be careful with the coronavirus, with a style that everyone knows,” she said in a telephone interview on Wednesday after her sentencing, which her lawyers have appealed. “I did not even think about how big this would get when I shared it,” she added. Ms. Chargui, who said she considers herself an atheist, has since deleted the initial post but maintains that she is within her rights to express her personal beliefs. “My mother wears the veil, she is Muslim, and she supports me,” she said. “I want to be able to live in my country and show that you can be a non-Muslim as well.” Ms. Chargui’s appeal is likely to be heard by a court in September or October, and she remains free until then. Tunisia has been praised for a successful democratic transition, despite some political instability, after the Arab Spring uprising that gripped the nation and ultimately toppled the longtime autocratic president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Last year, the country of nearly 12 million people completed its second set of free presidential elections since the revolution. Since the transition to a democratic system, state prosecutors have pursued some individuals for “harming religion” in 2011 and 2012, including two atheists who were sentenced to seven years of jail time for sharing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. (The two were granted presidential pardons two years later.) But such cases have dwindled after a new Constitution was introduced in 2014 that provides protection of religious freedom and freedom of speech, among other personal liberties. Yet for some, Ms. Chargui crossed a red line in sharing an image mimicking the sacred text, according to Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Tunis-based deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. “Some of the comments on Facebook show that what she did is still taboo, even for ‘progressive’ people,” said Ms. Guellali, who said the decision was disproportionate to the perceived offense. For now, as Ms. Chargui waits for a ruling on her appeal, her life is filled with uncertainty. Her landlord, she said, had ordered her family to leave the house they have been renting in Tunis for 10 years, “because he wants nothing to do with us.” Lilia Blaise reported from Tunis and Elian Peltier from London.']","Emna Chargui, 27, said she didn’t want to offend anyone when she shared another Facebook user’s post about the coronavirus that mimicked Quranic iconography."
"In Rare Surge of Online Unity, Iranians Call for Halt to Executions",2020-07-15,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['Iranians from all walks of life — teachers, doctors, designers, cooks, actors, directors, artists, homemakers, bloggers — have taken to social media with a message for the government: Stop the executions. The online campaign, which took place on Tuesday and which analysts said was remarkable for its scope and the breadth of its support, was in response to the judiciary’s announcement earlier in the day that it had upheld the death sentences of three young men who joined antigovernment protests in November. Iran put 251 people to death last year, more than any country but China, according to Amnesty International. In recent weeks, many Iranians have been rattled by a series of executions based on murky charges, from drinking alcohol to political activism to allegedly spying for the C.I.A. “I’m next, you’re next, we’re next,” read a meme that was widely shared online. It was a rare moment of solidarity among Iranians of varying political views around a single issue. Human rights activists said it suggested that Iranians were seeking new ways to be heard, with the government having brutally crushed street protests and other forms of dissent. By midday Tuesday, the most-tweeted hashtag within Iran was #DontExecute in Persian, according to Twitter. Iranians all over the world joined the campaign, and the hashtag trended globally, with nearly 4.5 million tweets. “I’ve never seen a hashtag with this level of participation from Iranians everywhere,” said Amir Rashidi, a digital researcher with a focus on internet security. Past issues, including political prisoners and Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, had generated considerable social media engagement, but not like what was seen on Tuesday, he said. The call to end executions also generated tens of thousands of posts on other platforms popular in Iran, like Instagram and Telegram. NetBlocks, which tracks global internet usage, reported significant internet disruption within Iran on Tuesday night, as did individual Iranians. The government routinely disrupts or shuts off the internet and mobile services when faced with demonstrations or significant internal dissent. The three condemned men, Amirhossein Moradi, 25, Saeed Tamjidi, 27, and Mohammad Rajabi, 27, were part of a nationwide uprising in November as people took to the streets to protest rising gasoline prices. Rights organizations say the security forces killed at least 500 protesters, and 7,000 people were arrested. The three were charged with “participation in vandalism and arson with the intent to confront and engage in war with the Islamic Republic of Iran.” In an open letter, the men’s lawyers said their clients had been forced to confess under “aberrant conditions.” The Supreme Court turned down an appeal and upheld the death sentences on Tuesday, the judiciary announced. A broad range of Iranians joined the online campaign denouncing the sentences. “Every human life is precious. #DontExecute,” Mojgan Rezaei, a lifestyle blogger in Tehran, wrote on Instagram, where she has more than 200,000 followers. “We are overwhelmed with grief, running out of time to mourn. #DontExecute,” tweeted a Tehran-based economist, Siamak Ghasemi. Well-known figures followed, some of them with millions of followers: Mohsen Chavoshi, a pop singer; Azar Mahisefat, a grandmother and a food blogger; Taraneh Alidousti, an actress; Asghar Farhadi, a filmmaker who has won two Oscars. Hossein Mahini, a player for Iran’s beloved national soccer team, sent a tweet with the #DontExecute hashtag written three times, once for each of the men facing death. Ordinary internet users who rarely weigh in on political issues shared photos of the three men. Sara, a homemaker with two young daughters who asked that her last name not be reported, posted a photo of three bleeding red roses and wrote: “Enough. Don’t execute life.” Politicians took notice. Former Vice President Mohamad Ali Abtahi, a cleric, warned in a tweet that the government should not be stubborn in the face of such strong public opinion. A former member of Parliament, Parvaneh Salahshouri, tweeted a line of poetry about oppression with the #DontExecute hashtag. “Nothing shakes and weakens the foundations of the government and provokes public retaliation like spilling the blood of innocent people,” Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent reformist politician, wrote on Twitter, also using the hashtag. Iranians, including advocates for human rights, said the government was making an example of the three men to intimidate the public and pre-empt any future uprisings, amid widespread discontent over the dismal economy and the authorities’ handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Iran’s currency has been in a daily free fall. This week, rials were trading at 230,000 to the dollar; a month ago, the figure was 130,000. Prices for basic goods have been fluctuating drastically. And the pandemic continues to rage, with daily case numbers climbing and 25 provinces having been declared “red zones.” “The society is boiling, so they are increasing the number of executions,” said Roya Boroumand, executive director of the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which pushes for human rights in Iran. The message, she said, was “remember we can kill.”\xa0']","Actors, scholars, star athletes and millions of others called for three young protesters’ lives to be spared. “I’m next, you’re next, we’re next,” one meme read."
"For U.K.’s Minority Women, Economic Toll of Lockdown Lingers",2020-07-15,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — Within 10 days of the British government’s lockdown announcement in late March, one woman lost all nine of her cleaning jobs. Another was laid off from a laundromat after she requested a mask, and a live-in nanny was fired for using public transport on her day off. In separate interviews, the three women said that they had expected to confront hardships during the lockdown. But as the economy starts to reopen, they and other women on the lower rungs of the economy say they are still struggling, weighed down by debts accumulated during the freeze and often facing pay cuts or forced to do more work for the same wages. The three have one other thing in common. They are all women of color, a group that has long faced economic and racial inequality in Britain and is now being hit disproportionately by the financial and psychological impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recent study by a group of British universities and women’s charities. “Covid-19 has brought the harsh realities of pre-existing racial inequalities into sharp relief, and nowhere is this more manifest than the disproportionate social and economic impact of Covid-19 on Black and ethnic minority women,” said Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the Runnymede Trust, a London-based organization advocating racial equality. The main reason that people of color are so vulnerable, experts say, is that they are more likely to be in precarious employment or to become unemployed, making it harder for them to qualify for government support and to protect themselves from the virus. Minji Paik, a Korean beautician who works in a hair salon in East London, said she made 15 pounds an hour before the pandemic, about $19 dollars, plus tips. Now she is making £10 an hour, and has been working longer shifts because of staff shortages. “My manager says this is temporary and she will give me more money when we make money,” Ms. Paik said. “But actually, I should be paid more because I’m working inside and risking my health.” A government review of the disparities in the risk and outcomes from the coronavirus found that death rates have been higher in Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups than in white groups. The review found that Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and other Asians, as well as Caribbeans and other Black people, had from 10 percent to 50 percent higher risk of death than white Britons. “There’s often a risk when people start talking about the underlying causes of death because of the assumption that the reason is related to genetics or poor diets,” said Bridget Byrne, director of the Center on Dynamics of Ethnicity at the University of Manchester. “But actually, you need to look at the wider process of racism and the structuring of race and deprivation.” The precarious nature of the current labor market is a contributing factor as well, Ms. Byrne said. “It makes people less willing to voice their concerns, they worry that if they say, ‘I don’t feel safe, I don’t think I should be coming in,’ they will be the first to be laid off.” Candice Brown, 48, a cleaner who is of Jamaican descent, said she had lost all her clients when lockdown measures were imposed in March. “They phoned me one by one to say don’t come,” she recalled, referring to the owners of the nine houses she cleaned each week in the city of Manchester, in northwestern England. “Each call was like a bomb, blasting every bit of my livelihood until I had no work left.” For two months she tried to navigate the government’s financial support system for those affected by the pandemic, and even borrowed money from a friend to hire an accountant to help. But eventually, she found out that she was not eligible for any aid because she lacked the paperwork to prove her employment history. “I applied for universal credit,” she said referring to the government’s income support program. “But I am still waiting. I haven’t received a penny.” Even with the easing of the lockdown measures, Ms. Brown has not been invited back to work because her employers fear that she could contract and spread the virus by working between multiple households. “I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this,” she said. “In the first month, I was worrying about how to pay my rent and my bills, now I can’t sleep worrying about how to feed my children.” A survey published by the Fawcett Society, a women’s rights charity, found that nearly 43 percent of Black and ethnic minority women believed that they would be in more debt than before the pandemic, compared with 37 percent of white women and 34 percent of white men. More than four in 10 of the women said they would struggle to make ends meet over the next three months. Many are tasked with carrying out menial tasks that can be perilous in a pandemic, a recent study by the Runnymede Trust found. Zuhr Rind, 48, a Pakistani laundromat worker in East London, was asked to work the last shift when the pandemic broke out so that she could wash the uniforms of the front-of-house employees, who collected laundry from clients. “I was not happy about it, but what could I do? Work is work and I was afraid to lose my job if I made an argument,” she said. When she asked for a face mask, her manager chided her, she said. “That is pathetic Z,” her manager wrote back in a text message she showed to The New York Times. “Doctors and nurses do not even have enough masks and they’re still going to work.” A day later, Ms. Rind said, she was laid off. “When you have brown skin, when you have an accent and when you don’t have a high education, you don’t have choices,” she said. “And this is a very dangerous situation to be in during Covid.” The laundromat where she worked did not respond to a request for comment. Ms. Rind was recently offered a cleaning job in a hotel but was forced to turn it down because she lives 40 minutes away and, as a precaution against the virus, the employer did not want her to take public transport. Black and ethnic minority women also generally have much lower levels of savings and assets than white Britons, according to the Runnymede Trust study. So those who lost their jobs in the pandemic have had to seek new employment straight away, forcing some of them to take lower-paid, higher-risk posts. Verona Pollard, an experienced nanny and maternity nurse, has taken up part-time child care work since she was fired from a full-time nannying job, after her employer found out she had taken public transport on her days off. “She was ruthless about it and wouldn’t take me back, even when the lockdown was lifted,” she said in a phone interview. “ It’s been brutal since then, I’m just doing odd jobs here and there.” And in the Fawcett Society’s survey, work-related anxiety was highest among Black and minority ethnic women, with 65.1 percent of women employed outside the home reporting that they felt apprehensive as a result of having to go to work during the pandemic. Ms. Brown, the cleaner in Manchester, said that she was still waiting for her unemployment benefits to come through and that she had been borrowing money from a friend and from a former employer to get by. In recent weeks, she said she has become so stressed and anxious that rashes have broken out over her body and she has noticed her hair falling out. “I promise you, what I am going through now is worse than any virus,” she said.']","Black and other ethnic minority groups have long faced economic and racial inequality in Britain. As workers return, many are saddled with debt and working longer hours for less pay."
"In a Rare Public Appearance, the Queen Knights Captain Tom",2020-07-17,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — When Queen Elizabeth II tapped Sir Tom Moore on both shoulders with a sword at Windsor Castle on Friday, she confirmed the noble status of a 100-year-old man whose achievements during the pandemic had already propelled him into the ranks of Britain’s most exalted citizens. Yet the ceremony was remarkable in a couple of other ways. It brought together two of the greatest living links to Britain’s World War II history — the queen who worked as a young driver and truck mechanic during the war, and a decorated Army officer who fought in the infamous Burma campaign and has found celebrity as the charitable fund-raiser known as Captain Tom. It also brought the queen out of seclusion for her first face-to-face meeting with a member of the public since March 19, when she hastily left Buckingham Palace as the coronavirus bore down on London. Conferring a knighthood on Mr. Moore, who raised $40 million for Britain’s National Health Service by walking 100 laps of his garden, was evidently worth the risk of stepping out. “Tom, with his remarkable achievement, was important to honor,” said Dickie Arbiter, who served as the queen’s press secretary from 1988 to 2000. Equally important, he said, was her decision to show up in person to bestow the honor. “She’s always said she’s ‘got to be seen to be believed,’” he noted. Whether Britons will ever see their revered monarch in person again has become a wistful theme in the British tabloids in recent weeks, one made even more piquant by the once-in-a-century pandemic, which has showcased her ability to take to the airwaves and rally the nation during difficult times. But the queen’s age — she recently turned 94 — and her resulting vulnerability to the virus have raised doubts that she will ever be able to return to her life of diplomatic receptions, garden parties and hospital dedications. Her regular weekly meetings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been conducted by phone since the outbreak began. “Queen heartbreak,” said a typical headline in the Daily Express. “Will we ever see the queen in public again?” The answer, based on Friday’s ceremony, is yes — but at a far stricter remove than in pre-pandemic days. Mr. Moore’s investiture was held outdoors, in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle, rather than inside. Buckingham Palace banned the public, though Mr. Moore was allowed to bring his family. Bearing a sword that had belonged to her father, George VI, the queen approached Mr. Moore, who stood, rather than kneeled, with his walker. Neither wore a face mask, though as Mr. Arbiter noted, “the sword is quite long,” so the two were able to keep some distance. The queen drew closer to present Mr. Moore with the insignia of knight bachelor, and they chatted for a few minutes. The queen’s inability to mingle with her subjects has forced Buckingham Palace to turn to social media. The palace maintains accounts on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, and has posted pictures and videos of her activities, including a photo of her with her husband, Prince Philip, on his 99th birthday. Like other people of her age, a person with knowledge of the palace said, she has adjusted fitfully to technological innovations like Zoom calls. The queen has spoken on video with her grandson Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, who now live in Los Angeles, about the birthday of their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. Her first foray into virtual public engagements was in June, when she and her daughter, Princess Anne, spoke to a group of health workers — the queen occupying the center square on the familiar checkerboard of people staring into their screens. Royal watchers say the queen’s use of video calls has offered a glimpse into her personal interactions that is not often seen in images of her chatting in receiving lines. During a recent call with three members of the British military serving overseas, she served up a mix of stilted questions and wry asides. When Lance Cpl. Shanwayne Stephens of the Royal Air Force told the queen that he moonlighted as the pilot of the Jamaican bobsled team, she replied, “Gosh, sounds a very dangerous job,” and quizzed him about how he trained. Corporal Stephens told her he pushed cars up and down the road near his home in Peterborough, England. “Well I suppose that’s one way to train,” she said, as her eyes widened. The queen has kept up other official duties. She still digests official government papers that are delivered to her in red boxes. A few days before July 4, she spoke by phone with President Trump, who wished her a “happy birthday, marking 94 extraordinary years,” according to the White House. But the only other time she appeared in public was in June, when she watched a military parade to mark her birthday. She sat alone under a white canopied pavilion, flanked by two officers, as the first battalion of the Welsh Guards marched in socially distanced formation on the greensward of Windsor’s quadrangle. Windsor was also the site of a surprise wedding on Friday for the elder daughter of Prince Andrew, Princess Beatrice, who married a British property developer, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The couple had canceled their royal wedding in May. The queen and Prince Andrew witnessed the small ceremony, which Buckingham Palace said was private and socially distanced but still somewhat upstaged Mr. Moore’s investiture. Given her age and the danger of a second wave of infections, the queen is likely to remain an isolated figure for the foreseeable future. It is not clear she will even make her annual summer retreat to Balmoral Castle in Scotland, given the Scottish government’s concerns about visitors from England importing the virus. While certain kinds of interactions may never return, royal watchers noted that the large majority of Britons only experience the queen via television anyway. “She’s not going to disappear,” said Valentine Low, royal correspondent for The Times of London. “The idea that we’ll never see her again is kind of ridiculous.” In May, the queen won extravagant praise for a televised address in which she recalled her military service and exhorted Britons to pull together in the spirit of the Blitz to confront the pandemic. Her parting words, drawn from a famous wartime song by Vera Lynn, spoke to those who miss her. “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return,” the queen said. “We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”']","In the weeks before the ceremony to honor the 100-year-old war veteran and fund-raiser, some had wondered whether Britons would see Queen Elizabeth in person again."
Vatican Tells Bishops to Report Sex Abuse to Police (but Doesn’t Require It),2020-07-16,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The Vatican has told bishops around the world to report cases of clerical sex abuse to civil authorities even where local laws don’t require it — a step that abuse victims and their advocates have demanded over the decades in which the scandal has roiled the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican also urged bishops to investigate even abuse claims that seem to be “doubtful,” or are made anonymously, rather than dismissing them outright. But the new instructions are not binding and were not enshrined in the church’s canon law, prompting criticism that the Vatican still gives bishops too much leeway in judging the conduct of their priests. The instructions were instead part of a new handbook intended to guide bishops and religious superiors who may have little experience handling abuse cases. “What is important to remember today is that it is still allowable under canon law for a bishop to not report a priest who is raping a child; it is still allowed for thousands of the world’s bishops,” Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a victims advocacy and research group, said in a telephone interview. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, which has long called for mandatory reporting to the police, called the new guidance “a step forward, but the smallest of steps.” The change comes after three popes over three decades have tried to manage an abuse scandal that has involved tens of thousands of accusations against priests and clerics.  Pope Francis, who was elected in 2013, has gone further than his predecessors, experts say, in trying to establish a universal set of practices for a global church, consulting abuse victims and laypeople and urging church leaders to cooperate with civil authorities.  But Francis has also been accused of falling short of actually enacting into law the forceful reforms he has advocated. An unprecedented sexual abuse summit at the Vatican in February 2019 raised hopes that a turning point had been reached, but it fell short of providing the clear global battle plan that Catholics have demanded.  Critics say the biggest, perennial problem for the church has been the lack of transparency and the continued failure to hold bishops accountable.  The first of the pope’s 21 recommendations to bishops when the Vatican conference began was to develop a “practical handbook indicating the steps to be taken by authorities at key moments when a case emerges.” The guidelines issued Thursday checked that box. For years, bishops have tried to handle abuse cases internally, using church investigators, tribunals and commissions in their own dioceses before cases are forwarded to the Vatican office known as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  Last year, Pope Francis issued a church law that obligated bishops — for the first time — to report accusations of clergy sexual abuse to their superiors. Until now, though, the Vatican had expected bishops to report abuse accusations to the police and prosecutors only when required by law. Many countries, and some American states, do not have such laws. The new instructions — issued Thursday by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith  — are likely to have the most impact in countries that do not have a well-developed system for handling abuse cases, said the Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Vatican’s child-protection commission and president of the Center for Child Protection of the Pontifical Gregorian University. He said bishops had been requesting step-by-step guidelines “for a long time.” The new handbook says: “Even in cases where there is no explicit legal obligation to do so, the ecclesiastical authorities should make a report to the competent civil authorities if this is considered necessary to protect the person involved or other minors from the danger of further criminal acts.” The Vatican described the handbook as an “instruction manual” meant to assist its clergy in addressing crimes that remain for the Church, “a profound wound that cries out for healing.” Msgr. Giacomo Morandi, secretary of Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said in an interview published in The Vatican News on Thursday that the new guidelines call for the investigation of most cases of reported abuse, even those that emerge from anonymous complaints.  “It has become clear that a peremptory attitude in one sense or another is not conducive to the search for truth and justice,” he said. The handbook says that allegations should only be dismissed if the bishop finds it is impossible to proceed because, for example, the accuser was not a minor when the abuse occurred, or it is clear that the accused perpetrator was not present. The document notes that crimes against minors can include everything from sexual relations to pornography to “conversations and/or propositions of a sexual nature” online.  It reaffirms that reports of crimes received during confession cannot be revealed, but calls on the priest hearing confession to “seek to convince the penitent to make that information known by other means” so that the “appropriate authorities” can take action.  The document also advises bishops against what was for many years a common practice: simply transferring an accused priest to another parish, locality or country, “with the idea that distancing him from the place of the alleged crime or alleged victims constitutes a sufficient solution of the case.”  And the handbook warns that bishops who do not investigate accusations of abuse could face canonical proceedings for negligence.']","Advocates for abuse victims had long asked the Roman Catholic Church to make this change, but said the new guidance still gives bishops too much leeway."
Homesick Student Cycles From Scotland to Greece During the Pandemic,2020-07-15,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Nearly a month into the coronavirus lockdown, Kleon Papadimitriou, a Greek student in Aberdeen, Scotland, was feeling homesick. Restless — and with flights to much of Europe canceled — he was looking for a way home to Athens. His father joked that he could simply walk, and a light bulb went on. What if he cycled? “I wanted something big, a project for the year,” the younger Mr. Papadimitriou said by phone on Tuesday. What followed was a cycling journey across Europe that spanned five countries, more than 2,000 miles and 48 days, with Mr. Papadimitriou finally arriving home in Athens late last month. Mr. Papadimitriou, 20, studies electrical and electronic engineering at the University of Aberdeen, but when classes stopped, he found himself with a sudden surplus of time and energy. So, turning the strictures of the pandemic into an opportunity and motivation, he began planning his trip by bike across a coronavirus-hit Europe. Less than a month later, on May 10, he was packed and ready to leave Aberdeen, in northeastern Scotland, with a handful of essential supplies. Making the cut: phone, power bank, some tools, two changes of clothes, a raincoat, a windbreaker, a tent, sleeping bag, food for four days and water. A book he had wanted to bring took up too much space, so had to be left behind. In the beginning, he had daily regrets about his self-inflicted odyssey, he said. His first day on the road proved trying. “My parents did not know where I was, I started crying,” he said. “I didn’t know where I’d stay for the night.” He asked a pizza delivery man, who directed him to a nearby grove, where he regrouped, had some food and called his parents. “I learned a lot of things about myself, about handling myself in difficult situations, when I have a low morale, and how important some relationships are,” he said. Besides getting lost, the first days of his trip were full of difficulties that included flat tires, bad weather, and steep climbs. When he set out, he planned to cover about 125 miles a day. But he soon realized that such a goal would be unlikely. Instead, he covered about 75 miles a day at most. A week into his journey, he arrived at a friend’s house in Leeds, a city in northern England, where he stayed for two days. He also took his first shower since leaving Scotland. Departing again was a challenge. “I was thinking ‘God, what am I doing with my life,’ ” he said. But his spirits lifted when he reached his first milestone: boarding a ferry from Britain to the Netherlands, and crossing his first national border. “It was the point of no return,” he said. Four days later, and after staying at campsites, he made it to Germany. Friends of friends let him stay over, though most did not want him inside their houses because of the coronavirus, so he set up his tent in their gardens. He was being careful around people too, wary of getting sick while on the road. He made it to another important, milestone: Stuttgart, where his grandmother lives. “It was very important to me, it was like a checkpoint,” he said. “I hadn’t seen my grandma for so many years, and the only thing I cared about was, if something were to happen to me, I didn’t want it to happen before I got to Stuttgart.” He stayed with her for a week to rest and refuel, his first time eating a proper homemade meal after weeks of a meager diet. After Germany came Italy, where businesses were gradually reopening after the first wave of the pandemic. He had a pepperoni pizza and a beer in the Italian Alps before heading to Venice, where he stayed for a day. Then it was on to Ancona, a seaside city on the Adriatic coast, where he boarded a ferry to Patras, in the Peloponnese region of Greece. “The moment I believed I could make it was when I boarded the ferry from Ancona,” Mr. Papadimitriou said, adding that before he had begun his journey he had estimated that it would take a maximum of 30 days. That turned out to be optimistic. Mr. Papadimitriou finally made it to Greece on June 25, 46 days after leaving Aberdeen. His parents met him in Patras, where he was tested for the coronavirus — the result was negative — and the three of them cycled the final stretch together. On June 27, they arrived home in Athens. “I think that if I had not already done it, and if someone were to tell me I could do it, I wouldn’t believe it,” he said. “I had no idea that I had the patience and the willpower.” He hopes to take another journey along the same lines — or bigger — in the future, he said. For now, he is resting at home and enjoying a more varied diet than the foods that sustained him for much of his 48-day trip. “I want to take some time off sardines,” he said. “I think I liked them because I was so hungry but now I don’t even want to look at them.”']","It took the 20-year-old Kleon Papadimitriou 48 days to travel from Aberdeen to Athens, riding more than 2,000 miles as the coronavirus shut down other modes of transport."
Big Business in Bangladesh: Selling Fake Coronavirus Certificates,2020-07-16,By Jeffrey Gettleman and Sameer Yasir,"['NEW DELHI — The Bangladeshi authorities have arrested the owner of a hospital who they said had sold migrant workers thousands of certificates showing a negative result on coronavirus tests, when in fact many tests were never performed. The authorities said they caught the hospital owner on Wednesday trying to sneak across the border into India disguised as a woman. Police officers said that when they arrested the owner — a man they identified as Mohammad Shahed, with a long criminal record — he was wearing a black burqa that covered him head to toe. Over the past week and a half, Bangladeshi investigators pieced together what happened: Mr. Shahed’s hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, had been selling fake coronavirus certificates — thousands of them, at $59 apiece — indicating that a patient had tested negative, the Bangladeshi authorities said. There is a huge market for these certificates among migrant workers from Bangladesh hungry to get back to work in Europe, doing jobs like stocking grocery stores, bussing tables in restaurants or selling bottled water on the streets. Many Bangladeshi workers have recently flown to Italy, where they said that employers required such certificates before allowing them to go back to work. As Bangladeshi police officers began to close in on Mr. Shahed, he vanished, the authorities said. But after a nine-day search, they caught him at the border. The widespread use of fake Covid-19 certificates has been “a huge blow to the image of our country,” said Obaidul Quader, a minister in Bangladesh’s government. Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Millions of Bangladeshis work overseas, sending billions of dollars back home, keeping the economy afloat. During this pandemic, many workers who had come back to Bangladesh for a short break found themselves cut off from their jobs overseas and were eager to get back to work. Mr. Quader, the minister, has said that different criminal syndicates were operating across Bangladesh, luring migrant workers with virus-free certificates and, in turn, endangering many lives. The Bangladeshi authorities said that the Regent Hospital, run by Mr. Shahed, had issued more than 10,000 certificates and that most of them were fake, backed by no actual coronavirus test. Two other doctors have been arrested and accused of selling thousands of fake virus certificates from their laboratory in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi authorities said that special law enforcement agents were on the hunt for others like them. Bangladesh’s coronavirus situation is especially murky. The country, home to more than 160 million people, has reported around 200,000 cases. But with the virus sweeping through South Asia, and with testing relatively low in Bangladesh, health experts believe the country has a much higher infection rate than the official numbers indicate. Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, has ordered the suspension of all flights coming in from Bangladesh after at least 37 Bangladeshi passengers arrived in Rome and tested positive for Covid-19, according to Agence France-Presse. Last week, Italy sent back 168 Bangladeshis who had arrived at airports in Rome and Milan, Italy’s health ministry confirmed. Even before the testing scam was exposed, Bangladeshi law enforcement officials said that Mr. Shahed had been investigated in more than 30 other criminal cases connected to corruption, embezzlement and running fraudulent companies. He has served two years in prison, the authorities said. Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: “He is a known criminal,” said Faizul Islam, a member of Bangladesh’s elite police unit, the Rapid Action Battalion. And, Mr. Islam added, “we are acting against others.” Bangladesh’s foreign ministry released a statement on Thursday saying that “around 1,600 Bangladeshis who went to Italy recently did not carry fake Covid-19 negative certificates.” But the statement added, “some Bangladeshis who traveled to Italy in the recent days did not follow the mandatory quarantine rule, and probably a few of them might have spread the virus in the community.” Fiorenza Aini, a spokeswoman in the press office of Italy’s justice ministry, said that she was not aware of any current joint investigation between Italy and Bangladesh. Giuseppe Mazzara, a spokesman from the Lazio region, which includes Rome, said that more than 6,000 coronavirus swab tests had been carried out on people who traveled to Italy from Bangladesh in the month of June, as well as people they came into contact with. So far, 191 had tested positive, he said. Taheer Hussain, a Bangladeshi migrant laborer who works in the kitchen of a restaurant in Milan, said that Italian newspapers have been continuously reporting on a surge of Covid-19 cases in the Bangladeshi community, making ordinary workers suspect. “People are looking at us with suspicious eyes,” Mr. Hussain said on phone from Milan, “as if we all are infected by virus.” Jeffrey Gettleman reported from New Delhi, and Sameer Yasir from Srinagar, Kashmir. Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Bergamo, Italy.']",A hospital owner was arrested trying to flee in disguise after selling certificates saying that migrant workers were coronavirus-free.

North Macedonia Election Returns No Clear Winner,2020-07-16,By Patrick Kingsley,"['BERLIN — The first general election in North Macedonia since the country changed its name and resolved a longstanding dispute with neighboring Greece has ended with no clear winner, leaving the country’s future diplomatic trajectory in the balance. The center-left Social Democrats emerged as the strongest party, taking 36.3 percent of the vote with nearly 90 percent of ballots counted. That leaves the party several seats short of the 61 it needs to form a majority in the 120-seat Parliament, and facing several days of tense coalition talks with smaller parties. The Social Democrats’ closest rival, the nationalist VMRO-DPMNE, won about 34.9 percent, meaning that it could still gain power with the support of smaller parties representing the country’s ethnic Albanian minority.”It’s still on the precipice,” said Petar Arsovski, a political analyst and polling expert based in North Macedonia. The muddy result reflects the ambivalence many Macedonians feel toward Zoran Zaev, the Social Democrats’ leader.  As prime minister, he angered some voters by changing the country’s name and by what they saw as foot-dragging on an overhaul of the judicial system. But Mr. Zaev did raise wages, led North Macedonia into NATO and cleared the way for its European Union application by settling longstanding disputes with Greece and Bulgaria. While Mr. Zaev’s nationalist opponents support the country’s membership in NATO and its E.U. application, they also want to revisit aspects of the deals with Greece and Bulgaria. That would be likely to cause a diplomatic row, raising the risk that Greece and Bulgaria, both E.U. members, could hinder North Macedonia’s application. It could also distract international mediators from addressing other tensions in the Balkans, like the still unresolved dispute between Kosovo and Serbia. While Mr. Zaev has been praised as a statesman outside the country, within North Macedonia he divides opinion, partly because of a step his government took to end its diplomatic isolation: adding the word “North” to the country’s name, a move that reassured Greece that its neighbor no longer harbored any secret claims over the Greek region also named Macedonia. That decision left many in the small Balkan nation feeling their identity had been erased. Many also resented the way Mr. Zaev pushed the amendment through Parliament, despite a majority of citizens boycotting a referendum on the subject. Mr. Zaev entered office in 2017 after a government led by VMRO-DPMNE collapsed amid a series of protests against corruption, judicial interference and government surveillance. His predecessor, Nikola Gruevski, later fled the country to escape corruption charges. Mr. Zaev resigned from the premiership in January to allow a caretaker government to oversee the election campaign. The quality of democracy in North Macedonia improved slightly during Mr. Zaev’s tenure, according to annual ratings issued by Freedom House, a Washington-based rights watchdog, but his critics believe he has not done enough to strengthen the judiciary or to combat corruption. Just over half of voters turned out, about 15 percentage points less than in 2016, partly because of fears over the spread of the coronavirus, analysts said.The election was initially scheduled for April but was postponed to avoid the peak of the pandemic. The election authority delayed the announcement of initial results because of problems with its website, which the authority attributed to a possible hacking attack. Alisa Dogramadzieva contributed reporting.']",Zoran Zaev changed North Macedonia’s name to allow it to join NATO and apply to the European Union.

Anger at Mali’s President Rises After Security Forces Kill Protesters,2020-07-16,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — When security forces in Mali shot and killed protesters last weekend, they were met with an unexpected response. Instead of being cowed into submission, the demonstrators have become more determined, announcing plans to continue their efforts for reform despite the violent crackdown. The leaders of the ballooning protest movement in the West African nation have called for mass civil disobedience until President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta steps down. Thousands are expected to rally at mosques across the country on Friday, to mourn those who were killed and to continue the series of demonstrations that began in early June. A team of regional mediators arrived in the capital, Bamako, on Wednesday night to try to mitigate the growing unrest, but Mr. Keïta has shown no sign of stepping down. Malians say those who are in charge have not done enough to address the corruption and bloodshed that have plagued the country for eight years, pulling in regional and French counterterrorism forces as well as American support. Thousands of civilians and soldiers have died. The economic suffering exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic has only brought more frustration and uncertainty. The last straw for protesters and their leaders came when the constitutional court overturned the provisional results of a long-delayed parliamentary election held in March. As they saw it, Mr. Keïta had stolen the election and installed his preferred candidates. “He has failed, and he has to go,” said Cheick Oumar Sissoko, a filmmaker and former minister of culture. Mr. Sissoko is part of the coalition of opposition politicians, religious leaders and civil society organizations that now calls itself the June 5 Movement, or the M5, after the date of the first protest six weeks ago. Mali has had a rough decade. A crisis that began with rebels and jihadists taking control of the north in 2012 has spread and deepened. Armed Islamist groups, ethnic militias, hunting groups and bandits have destabilized the country’s center. The insecurity has seeped over its southern borders. National security forces commit rampant abuses in the name of fighting terrorism. An expensive United Nations peacekeeping force is often seen as following an agenda set by the government. When the crisis began, troops from France, the country’s former colonial ruler, were welcomed with open arms. Now many Malians are calling for them to get out, suspicious of their motives. Despite recently praising each other at a high-level summit for their supposed victories, the French president and leaders from the G5 Sahel, a group of five West African countries that have come together to fight terrorism, have achieved little real progress, analysts say. All of this has given rise to mounting anger, but until last weekend, before the crackdown, the M5 had seemed ready to negotiate. Then the atmosphere changed. The killing of at least 11 protesters was “a red line that should not have been crossed,” said Boubacar Sangaré, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in the capital. “There is a convergence of crises and anger,” he said. Tens of thousands of people had gathered for peaceful protests on June 5 and June 19. But last Friday, the police response was brutal. Smoke rose from fires that protesters had lit in Mali’s peach-colored national assembly building in Bamako. Malians tuning into state television were greeted with an error message: demonstrators had taken it off the air. By the end of the weekend, 11 people had been killed, by the government’s count, though the protesters said the toll was higher, and more than 85 people were injured. Ousmane Diallo, a researcher on Francophone West Africa with Amnesty International, said many of those hurt had been shot with live bullets, and he agreed that the official count of the dead could be much too low. The crackdown was aimed at stopping the demonstrators from being “masters of the streets,” Mr. Diallo said. “They are trying to see if by sheer police repression, they can break down the movement, and show that they are the legitimate authority in Mali.” Critics of the government were especially outraged by the use of a counterterrorism police unit to quell the protests. In a joint statement released on Monday, the United Nations, the West African regional bloc, Ecowas, the African Union and the European Union condemned the use of lethal force by the police, and called for restraint. International mediators, led by the former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan, met with Mr. Keïta on Wednesday night, according to local journalists, and then met with M5 movement leaders and supporters, including Mahmoud Dicko, a powerful imam who is a driving force behind the protests. The prime minister’s office sent a letter on Tuesday to the former security minister, which was leaked and widely circulated on social media, asking why the counterterrorism unit was deployed and who ordered it onto the street. But many Malians say the buck stops with Mr. Keïta, the president since 2013. There are currently few other places it could land. Mali has had no functioning government for over a month. The prime minister, Boubou Cissé, resigned in early June to try to form a new government coalition. And though Mr. Cissé was swiftly reappointed by Mr. Keïta, he has not yet been able to form a new administration. Without an operating government, it will be difficult to determine who could be held accountable for the deaths of protesters. Calls seeking comment from the director-general of the police, Moussa Ag Infahi, went unanswered on Wednesday. Some M5 leaders have gone into hiding since the crackdown; others were detained and later released. “I was not arrested. I was kidnapped,” the opposition leader Issa Kaou Djim told Malian journalists on Monday, describing how he had been taken from his house late at night. Rumors that Mr. Dicko, the imam who met with international mediators on Wednesday, would also be arrested led protesters to build barricades around Badalabougou, the neighborhood where he preaches. Facing the cloth-wrapped bodies of people killed by security forces, Mr. Dicko led funeral prayers in a packed mosque. Mr. Dicko, who is originally from the northern region of Timbuktu, gained influence over a decade ago as chairman of the country’s High Islamic Council. He resigned last year to become more involved in politics. “I am not a politician. I never ran for a single term and I won’t start now,” he told the magazine Jeune Afrique. “But if caring about your country and the well-being of its people is political, then yes, I’m political.” At midnight on Saturday night, the president addressed the nation, dissolved the constitutional court and announced that there would be a government of national unity that included the opposition. M5’s original list of demands included dissolving both the constitutional court and the national assembly, and downgrading Mr. Keïta’s position to “honorary president,” with a prime minister chosen by M5. But “you cannot impose a prime minister with full power on a democratically elected president, so that the president becomes like the Queen of England,” said Fatoumata Sako, a campaign official who has worked for Mr. Keïta. For Mr. Sissoko, the former minister of culture, there were few alternatives beyond the list of demands from M5. “Demonstrators were killed with live bullets by the counterterrorism forces that should be on the front lines fighting terrorists.

"Police Have Too Much Access to People’s Data, German Court Rules",2020-07-17,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The German police and intelligence agencies have excessive access to citizens’ mobile and internet communications, the country’s Constitutional Court said on Friday, ordering the existing laws to be tightened. It was the latest decision by the court to support personal privacy over public security concerns in the digital sphere, which, taken together, have made the country a world leader in protecting personal privacy. Critics charge that the string of court decisions could hinder the ability of security services to prevent crimes and terrorist attacks. Under existing laws, the police and prosecutors can tap into an individual’s cellphone and internet data in the course of a criminal investigation, allowing them to see basic personal information that is stored by the telecom providers. Germany’s federal police can ask those providers for someone’s personal data as part of the investigation. That can include a person’s name, telephone numbers, home or I.P. addresses and birth date. Law enforcement authorities use the information to help them piece together crimes or track down terrorist suspects. But the information can be gathered without any concrete evidence linking an individual to a particular crime, raising fears that the information could be abused. The court ruled on Friday that while the transmission of such data was legally permissible, officials have too much leeway to obtain the information. It ordered current laws to be revised by 2021 to ensure that they “sufficiently limit the purposes for which the data is used.” Namely, the court ruled that only when the police or investigators have concrete evidence linking an individual to a specific crime will they be allowed to access the digital information. Katharina Nocun, a civil rights activist, and Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament for the Pirate Party, brought the case before the court in 2013.  They welcomed Friday’s ruling as a victory for personal privacy rights and democracy. “The ruling confirms that the legal hurdles for pervasive encroachment in the private sphere are far too low,” Ms. Nocun said. “Targeted interventions instead of new surveillance interfaces should be the name of the game in a democracy.” Ms. Nocun drew a connection to recent scandals that have rocked the German police, involving far-right sympathizers within their ranks who are suspected of leaking information to neo-Nazi groups that have threatened left-leaning lawyers and activists, including herself. She said she had received several online threats from groups identified with links to the police. “This experience only strengthened my resolve that we need strong legal controls for authorities’ access to sensitive data to prevent abuses,” Ms. Nocun said on Twitter. In a 2012 ruling on the issue, the court determined that in an increasingly digital world, investigators needed the “simplest possible method for tracing telephone numbers to individuals” to carry out their jobs. But Friday’s ruling was the latest attempt to revise that decision, and the court suggested that telecom providers develop a “back door” that would allow the authorities to call up the information they have a right to, while at the same time protecting more sensitive personal data.']",The Constitutional Court said that the current laws did not do enough to protect personal privacy in the digital realm.
"Monsoon Rains Pummel South Asia, Displacing Millions",2020-07-15,By Sameer Yasir,"['When heavy floods started inundating her riverside home last week in the village of Madarganj, northern Bangladesh, Habiba Begum chose to stay put with her family instead of moving to shelter. Ms. Begum’s family, desperate to save what few possessions they had, chained their only suitcase to their house, a makeshift structure of bamboo and banana leaves constructed after the last devastating flood in the area, just two years ago. As the waters rose, the house was marooned in muddied waters, and the family had to cook meals on a raised area of dry ground nearby. Then tragedy struck. Ms. Begum left her 1-year-old daughter, Lamia Khatun, on a patch of higher ground while she washed clothes in floodwaters on Tuesday. But the waters kept rising. “When I came back, she was gone,” Ms. Begum, 32, said. “We found her body hours later.” Across southern Asia, more than four million people have been hit hard by monsoon floods that have destroyed homes and structures, drowned entire villages and forced people to crouch on rooftops hoping for rescue. The monsoon season — usually June to September — brings a torrent of heavy rain, a deluge that is crucial to South Asia’s agrarian economy. But in recent years, the monsoon season has increasingly brought cyclones and devastating floods, causing the internal displacement of millions of people in low-lying areas, particularly in Bangladesh. Scientists say global warming has played a role by affecting rainfall patterns across the subcontinent. Instead of more constant but less intense rains, warming has increased the frequency of extreme rains, which are more likely to cause flooding. Last year, at least 600 people were killed and more than 25 million affected by flooding because of the torrential monsoon rains in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Nepal, according to the United Nations. And in 2017, more than 1,000 people died in floods across South Asia. Rainfall has been heaviest this year in northeast India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal, according to the Southeast Asia Flash Flood Forecast System, which is affiliated with the United Nations. The Bangladeshi authorities say that the flooding started in late June, inundations are expected to continue this month, and more areas will be affected. Enamur Rahman, the Bangladeshi minister for disaster management, said the inundations were the worst in decades and that hundreds of thousands of families had been marooned, forcing the authorities to open more than a thousand emergency shelters. “We are fighting the catastrophe with every possible resource available,” Mr. Rahman said. “It seems rains and floods will be prolonged this year.” Researchers have warned that within a few decades, Bangladesh, with a population of more than 160 million people, may lose more than 10 percent of its land to sea-level rise, caused by a warming climate, displacing as many as 18 million. India has also suffered immensely. Floods have swept across the states of Assam, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and other areas in the eastern part of the country. The authorities in the country have said that at least 85 people have died, with more than three million affected by the deluge. In the northeastern state of Assam, Kaziranga National Park, a World Heritage site that is a home to the one-horned Indian rhinoceros, a species listed as vulnerable by the WWF, has been completely inundated. Officials said that more than 50 animals had died in the flooding, though some wildlife had been rescued. With more than a dozen rivers and tributaries swelling above the danger mark, rescue operations have been carried out in at least 22 districts across Assam. In Nepal, 67 people have died and 40 others are missing, according to the National Emergency Operation Center. That is in additional to the monsoons that have battered Bangladesh. Low-lying and densely populated, the country is chronically ravaged by flooding. In Jamalpur, in the north, the flood situation has become critical, with rivers flowing well above the danger level. Muneeb-ul-Islam, 42, who lives in the area with his wife and three children, said he had lost his home several times in 10 years, leaving him with nothing but the clothes he was wearing. Mr. ul-Islam and his family are among more than a million people in Bangladesh left displaced or homeless by the floods. “It is as if we have committed some sin,” Mr. ul-Islam said. “This is the third time in the last few years that we will have to rebuild our lives from scratch.” Ms. Begum, who lost her 1-year-old, said her life had been completely destroyed. She has now moved to a nearby shelter, a school building, where hundreds of people were crammed in. Fear of the coronavirus spreading in such cramped quarters looms large. Ms. Begum’s family said there had not been enough warning about the magnitude of the flooding. “I will never go back to the place where we used to live,” she said, “The water has snatched everything from us.”']","Flooding in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Nepal has killed scores of people, destroyed homes and structures, drowned entire villages, and forced many to crouch on rooftops hoping for rescue."
"As if Yemen Needed More Woes, a Decrepit Oil Tanker Threatens Disaster",2020-07-17,By Rick Gladstone,"['Think of Yemen’s challenges, and war, starvation, disease and poverty come to mind. Now add another attribute: a rusting, neglected 1,188-foot tanker moored off the country’s western coast, laden with roughly 48 million gallons of oil, at risk of sinking or even exploding at any time. The United Nations and a variety of environmental experts have warned for years that the vessel, the FSO Safer, is like a floating bomb, one that could cause an ecological crisis with any leak in one of its 34 storage tanks. Together, they hold four times the amount of oil spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. A spill could further upend the lives of Yemen’s 28 million people, kill untold populations of fish and birds, poison coral reefs, gum up desalination plants and close the Red Sea shipping lanes and ports that are Yemen’s sole lifeline for international aid. The Safer’s rusting hull and corroding pipes and valves are not the only worries. It is not far from Hudaydah, a hotly contested port city, and the risks of a stray shell or bomb striking the vessel cannot be ruled out. “Should the situation get out of control, it will directly affect millions of people in a country that is already enduring the world’s largest humanitarian emergency,” Inger Anderson, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told the Security Council on Wednesday in a briefing about the tanker problem. “It will destroy entire ecosystems for decades and go beyond borders.” Prevention of either a spill or explosion aboard the Safer, Ms. Anderson said, “is really the only option to avoid an environmental and human catastrophe.” The vessel, which requires extensive upkeep, has not been properly maintained since war broke out more than five years ago between the Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led military coalition that has been trying to crush them. The Yemeni oil company that owns the Safer says it does not have the resources to service the vessel, which historically has functioned as a floating storage facility fed by the Marib-Ras Isa pipeline, which carries oil from eastern Yemen. A skeletal crew remains aboard, but much of the machinery used to prevent combustible buildups of gas in the tanks no longer operates. The Houthis, who control the region that surrounds the mooring area, have long balked at United Nations requests to assess the vessel’s condition. But they appeared to have a change of heart after a seawater leak into the Safer’s engine room in May, which the crew and an emergency team of divers sent by the vessel’s owner were able to temporarily patch. Speaking at the same Security Council briefing as Ms. Anderson, Mark Lowcock, the top relief official at the United Nations, said that the Houthi leadership had confirmed in writing that it would allow a long-planned U.N. mission to appraise the tanker, “which we hope will take place within the next few weeks.” Still, Mr. Lowcock was guarded in his optimism. In August of 2019, the Houthis consented to a United Nations request to inspect the tanker, only to cancel it the night before. The Houthis’ reluctance to relinquish control over the vessel stems in part from the group’s desire to sell the oil, or at least to use it for bargaining leverage with their Saudi adversaries. But the coronavirus pandemic has severely reduced the price of oil, making the Safer’s contents much less valuable. Moreover, the oil has been languishing in rusting tanks for at least five years, which may have befouled it. “The Houthis may think, ‘We need to get rid of this before this becomes a massive problem for us,’” said Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, an online service that monitors maritime shipments and storage of petroleum. “I would like to think that is the case.” Moreover, he said, the Safer’s cargo “is probably contaminated — this would be the last deposit of oil you would want to buy.” Ian M. Ralby, the founder and chief executive of I.R. Consilium, a maritime security consultancy, said it was possible that Houthi leaders who once viewed the Safer as an asset “may now see the benefit in allowing the situation to be resolved.” If there were an oil disaster, he said, “the fallout would rest on their heads, and they can’t afford the permanent black mark, having negative and fatal implications.” Other environmental and maritime shipping experts who have been keeping track of the Safer say there is no simple fix. The best hope, some said, is that once the U.N. inspectors can appraise the vessel’s condition, a salvage team will be permitted to siphon the oil out of its tanks into other vessels, then tow the Safer to a secure port for scrapping. How that can be done in the midst of a war zone, further complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, constitutes another underlying challenge. The task at hand is to keep a bad situation from getting worse, said Christopher M. Reddy, a marine scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who has studied the effects of oil spills like the Deepwater Horizon disaster. “We have a problem, it has a potential for harm, so how do we do it to create the least amount of damage?” he said.']",A rusting vessel used for years to store oil off Yemen’s coast poses what the United Nations has called a dire and entirely preventable threat of ecological catastrophe.
"No One Knows What Thailand Is Doing Right, but So Far, It’s Working",2020-07-16,By Hannah Beech and Adam Dean,"['BANGKOK — No one knows exactly why Thailand has been spared. Is it the social distancing embedded in Thai culture — the habit of greeting others with a wai, a prayer-like motion, rather than a full embrace — that has prevented the runaway transmission of the coronavirus here? Did Thailand’s early adoption of face masks, combined with a robust health care system, blunt the virus’s impact? Was it the outdoor lifestyle of many Thais, or their relatively low rates of pre-existing conditions? Is there a genetic component in which the immune systems of Thais and others in the Mekong River region are more resistant to the coronavirus? Or is it some alchemy of all these factors that has insulated this country of 70 million people? One thing is certain. Despite an influx of foreign visitors early in the year from countries badly hit by the coronavirus, Thailand has recorded fewer than 3,240 cases and 58 deaths. As of Thursday, there had been no cases of local transmission for about seven weeks. Thailand’s low rate of infection appears to be shared by other countries in the Mekong River basin. Vietnam has not recorded a single death and has logged about three months without a case of community transmission. Myanmar has confirmed 336 cases of the virus, Cambodia 166 and Laos just 19. Yunnan, the southwestern Chinese province through which the Mekong flows before meandering to Southeast Asia, had fewer than 190 cases. None are active now. “I don’t think it is about immunity or genetics alone,” said Dr. Taweesin Visanuyothin, the Covid-19 spokesman for Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health. “It has to do with culture. Thai people do not have body contact when we greet each other.” “This is how the countries in the Mekong region greet each other as well,” Dr. Taweesin added. It didn’t always look so upbeat. In January, Thailand confirmed the world’s first case of the coronavirus outside of China — in a tourist from Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the outbreak is believed to have begun. Another wave of infections was set off by people arriving from Japan, Europe and the United States. A Thai boxing event turned into a super-spreader event. But after a lockdown was enforced in March, shuttering businesses and schools, domestic transmissions subsided. All of Thailand’s recent cases have been among people who arrived from overseas. Dr. Wiput Phoolcharoen, a public health expert at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok who is researching an outbreak of the coronavirus in Pattani in southern Thailand, noted that more than 90 percent of those who tested positive there were asymptomatic, much higher than normal. “What we are studying now is the immune system,” he said. Dr. Wiput said Thais and other people from this part of Southeast Asia were more susceptible to certain serious cases of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne virus, than those from other continents. “If our immune systems against dengue are so bad, why can’t our immune system against Covid be better?” he asked. Though Thailand’s hospitals have not been overwhelmed by coronavirus patients, the country’s tourism-dependent economy has been battered. In April, Thailand banned almost all incoming flights, amid the tightening lockdown. Holidaymakers stopped coming to Bangkok, once the world’s most visited city. The Thai tourism and sports ministry estimates that 60 percent of hospitality businesses could close by the end of the year. The International Monetary Fund predicts the Thai economy will shrink by at least 6.5 percent this year. More than eight million Thais may lose their jobs or income in 2020, the World Bank has said, in a nation already cleaved by a yawning gap between rich and poor. Thai households have some of the highest debt loads in Asia, and the most desperate have lined up at Buddhist temples for handouts of rice. After a promised disbursement of emergency government funds was bogged down in bureaucracy, a woman swallowed rat poison outside of a government building. She survived, but suicides are up in Thailand. Covid Thailand Aid, a charity set up in the wake of the pandemic, has been inundated by pleas from Thais with only a dollar or two left in their bank accounts, said Natalie Narkprasert, one of the group’s founders. The country’s large population of migrant workers, many from neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia, is also hurting. While some people managed to make it home before the borders closed, others are stuck in Thailand with no wages from their jobs as hotel cleaners, kitchen hands and food stall operators. “Now is when people want more help because it’s been so long and it’s not going to get better,” Ms. Natalie said. A sense of normalcy has recently returned to Thailand. Schools have reopened with children wearing face masks and studying at spaced-out desks. And in early July, the first holiday weekend in months — Thai New Year festivities were canceled in April — prompted an uptick in domestic tourism. Thailand has also allowed a trickle of foreigners back into the country. But with the new arrivals comes the risk of contagion. This week, an Egyptian military pilot was confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus, after he breached quarantine and visited shopping centers in a Thai beach town. Some schools in the area are now closed again. Two activists who protested the government’s handling of the quarantine violation were arrested on Wednesday for contravening Thailand’s emergency decree. Questions are also being raised about why migrant workers who were deported from Thailand arrived home and immediately tested positive for the disease, despite not being included in the official Thai count of coronavirus cases. Thailand’s testing rates remain relatively low. “With the disease still looming,” said Dr. Taweesin, the health ministry spokesman, “we have to keep our guard up.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.']",
Bristol Removes Statue of Black Protester After Just One Day,2020-07-16,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Jen Reid, the Black Lives Matter protester whose statue was erected in place of a toppled slave trader in Bristol, England, on Wednesday, said just before the unauthorized installation that she did not know whether the city’s authorities would let it stand there for a few months or a single day. It turned out to be the latter. Workers removed the resin-and-steel statue of Ms. Reid at dawn Thursday, 24 hours after it was put up, bringing a swift curtain down on an act of guerrilla art that attracted widespread attention but did not impress city leaders. “I understand people want expression, but the statue has been put up without permission,” the mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday, soon after the figure was installed. “Anything put on the plinth outside of the process we’ve put in place will have to be removed.” “The people of Bristol will decide its future,” Mr. Rees added of the plinth where the 17th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, once stood before being toppled by protesters last month and thrown into the nearby harbor. The Bristol City Council said it would hold the statue of Ms. Reid, by the sculptor Marc Quinn, at a local museum for him “to collect or donate to our collection.” Mr. Quinn, who created the sculpture in a few weeks after seeing a photograph of Ms. Reid standing on the plinth during a protest, did not have an immediate response. In an earlier interview, Mr. Quinn said he did not expect Bristol to leave the statue, titled “A Surge of Power (Jen Reid),” in place permanently, though he hoped it would be there long enough to provoke a conversation about “how we commemorate people in statues.” He called it a “temporary sentence in the conversation.” Ms. Reid, a fashion stylist, climbed on the plinth during a Black Lives Matter demonstration after the crowd pulled down the bronze statue of Colston that had stood in the city since 1895, rolled it down the street, and dumped it in the harbor. Her pose, with her right arm thrust upward in a defiant gesture, inspired Mr. Quinn after he saw a picture of it on social media. Part of a cohort of British visual artists known as Young British Artists, Mr. Quinn drew attention in 2005 for a marble sculpture, “Alison Lapper Pregnant,” which depicted a woman with a condition that left her with no arms and shortened legs. It was placed on a plinth in Trafalgar Square in London. Mr. Quinn plans to install a piece next year on the steps of the New York Public Library that will consist of two identical cubes filled with frozen blood donated by thousands of refugees, as well as non-refugees. Inspired by the migrant crisis, it is meant to capture how under their skin, people are all the same.']","The statue of Jen Reid, a Black Lives Matter protester, was raised on Wednesday in place of a toppled memorial to the slave trader Edward Colston."
W.H.O. Asks for Help Fighting Growing Ebola Outbreak,2020-07-16,By David Waldstein,"['The World Health Organization raised the alarm Thursday about a growing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and warned of an imminent shortage of funds to fight the deadly disease. The organization said that 56 cases have been reported in Equator Province, which is greater than the total number of cases recorded in the province’s last outbreak in 2018. Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic have complicated the response to the Ebola outbreak, according to Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the W.H.O.’s regional director for Africa. “We must not let Covid-19 distract us from tackling other pressing health threats,” Dr. Moeti said. “The current Ebola outbreak is running into headwinds because cases are scattered across remote areas in dense rain forests.” The W.H.O. said in a statement that it has mobilized $1.75 million to combat the Ebola outbreak, which was declared on June 1, but that will only last a few more weeks. She called for additional funding to help with vaccinations, testing, contact tracing, treatment and health education. Another Ebola outbreak in the east of the country was declared over on June 25 after two years and 2,280 deaths. Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the W.H.O.’s emergency health program, who has worked extensively on Ebola, said on Monday that as of July 12 there were 17 deaths from confirmed Ebola cases and three more from suspected cases. He said that while the numbers may appear low, the threat of spread is worrisome, especially because of the extreme logistical problems for health care workers to access remote, affected communities. “Any one of those individual cases can result in amplification of the disease,” he said. Dr. Moeti said more than 12,000 people have been vaccinated in Equator in the six weeks since the outbreak started, beginning four days after the outbreak was declared. ']",The W.H.O.’s current funds for fighting an Ebola outbreak surging in Congo will only last a few more weeks.
U.S. Wants to Bar Members of China’s Communist Party. Who Are They?,2020-07-16,By Paul Mozur,"['As the Trump administration weighs a travel ban against the members of the Chinese Communist Party and their relatives, it is considering cutting off a vast sector of Chinese society — 92 million people — that often defies stereotypes, including those who walk the halls of power in Beijing, supervise China’s schools and run major companies. Barring them would change the topography of the U.S.-China relationship in the most prosaic of ways: It would cut off huge numbers of regular Chinese who, in pre-coronavirus pandemic times, traveled to the United States by the millions to do business, see the sights, shop at high-end department stores and study at some of the country’s most elite universities. Blocking the party members would not only turn off an economic spigot for the United States, but also plunge the relationship between the world’s two largest economies into a new phase of deeper isolation. Who are the members of the Communist Party? Here’s what we know. Some Communist Party members are the stolid apparatchiks of the Communist stereotype; many are not. At the heady heights of political power in Beijing, members craft harsh crackdowns, misleading propaganda and sweeping surveillance designed to preserve the party’s autocratic rule over the country. They keep tabs on people they consider political troublemakers and control China’s government in Beijing. They enforce rules that have led to the internment of more than a million members of minorities like the Uighurs in the country’s west. Yet voices of dissent have also come from the party. Dr. Li Wenliang, who sounded the alarm online about a mysterious virus that emerged in China and was interrogated by the police for his trouble before dying of Covid-19, was a party member. So, too, is the Uighur economist Ilham Tohti, a winner of the Sakharov Prize. Recent statistics showed 12.3 million of them are 30 or younger, about half have college or university degrees, and 27.9 percent are female. Many party members also offer child care services, run schools, manage technology companies, organize beach cleanups, act in blockbuster movies and do outreach to older Chinese citizens. Alongside them are academics, scientists and business people — lifelines for a U.S.-Chinese economic relationship that has persisted despite souring ties. For those not at the top rungs of power, membership in the party is often a way to fuel one’s career by making the right connections. During the boom years from the 1980s to the early 2010s, many Chinese joined the party to get a leg up in business, academics and the arts. Founded in 1921, the Communist Party has dominated politics in China since it won a civil war against the Nationalists of the Republic of China in 1949. Since then, it has gone through many evolutions, some dictated by practicality, others by the small-minded calculations of power grabs. In recent decades, the party has appeared to emerge as a bastion of technocrats wielding industrial policy and close ties to business to emphasize economic growth, even as they sharply punished those who defied their power. Under Xi Jinping, China’s top leader,  a party that 10 years ago was often jokingly called a business group masquerading as Marxists has reaffirmed its Communist roots. Members must engage in study sessions of high theory, at times with the tracking power of apps to monitor their reading habits. Mr. Xi has emphasized political loyalty over economic benefits, and a ferocious anticorruption crackdown has taken some of the shine out of joining. He has also made the selection process more rigorous: What was once a dull formality has become more difficult and selective. Applicants are subjected to an investigation and a battery of tests and interviews, before years of waiting for full membership. The power and symbols of the Communist Party of China loom inside companies and other organizations, and new, shinier hammer-and-sickle signs have popped up at community centers in towns and cities across the country. Inside the party’s multiplicities, there are books and playgrounds for children. But surveillance is a given, with officials neatly tracking local happenings, reporting political troublemakers via databases. Party committees, once ceremonial and dormant at private companies, have gained new powers. Many top executives, like Jack Ma, co-founder of Alibaba, are members. Overseas, the party’s structure has helped tie together institutions that run influence campaigns to drum up support for China. Yet even as Mr. Xi has brought back many Mao trappings, like study sessions and surveillance, people still join for the professional perks, not the stultifying ideology. Tempted by the prospects of better jobs, many students sign up in university, well before they have a fully developed political outlook. Admittance is often seen as a sign of excellence. In the southern tech hub of Shenzhen in 2018, a sign encouraged entrepreneurs with a slogan that would boggle the mind of the orthodox Marxist: “Follow our party, start your business.” With party members making up a bewilderingly huge portion of society in China, some tell stories of the party losing the records of their membership. Mr. Xi, in seeking to revive the party, has gone after myriad members who have not paid dues for years. If even Beijing is struggling to track the 92 million party members and their families, it’s not clear that the United States could do a much better job if it decides to carry out its travel ban. Experts cautioned that the draft ban would be all but impossible to enforce on a wide scale. Even so, the United States could set up new mechanisms by which the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security could more closely track party membership. Several Chinese citizens who recently traveled to the United States said they did not recall being asked about party affiliation. Though some travel applications from the State Department explicitly ask. Any new rule would also be easier to apply to more prominent Chinese political leaders and their families. Children of top leaders might struggle to gain entry to the United States if the order is signed. Mr. Xi’s daughter, Xi Mingze, for instance, attended Harvard under a pseudonym several years ago. Yet, if enforced strictly, the visa ban could make life difficult for many others. Scholars and business people who regularly visit the United States might have to either disclose their membership or risk running afoul of laws that punish falsification of visa applications. A spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, called the possible move by the Trump administration “very pathetic.” “The United States, as the most powerful country, what has it left? What kind of impression does it want to leave the world? We hope that the United States will stop doing such things that do not respect the basic norms of international relations.” The U.S. threat alone could keep many from coming to the States and do more to push business conferences and other events that include Americans and Chinese to other countries — like Canada. Lin Qiqing contributed research.']","With more than 90 million members and led by Xi Jinping, the party encompasses people at the heights of Chinese power and the civil servants of everyday life."
Burning Ships in Iran Add to String of Dozens of Explosions and Fires,2020-07-15,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['A large fire broke out at a shipyard in the southern Iranian port city of Bushehr on Wednesday, burning seven ships and sending plumes of black smoke billowing above the city skyline, according to videos and Iranian media reports. The fire followed dozens of recent fires and explosions across Iran’s forests, factories and military and nuclear facilities in the past three months that have rattled ordinary Iranians. Iranian officials have said that some of the episodes may have been acts of sabotage but blamed weather, accidents and equipment malfunctions for the others. On Tuesday an aluminum factory in the industrial city of Lamard, in Fars Province, caught fire. On Sunday, a fire broke out at petrochemical plant in Khuzestan Province. An explosion at the country’s top nuclear facility in Natanz two weeks ago damaged the structure where centrifuges were assembled and has been attributed to Israeli sabotage. There have also been explosions at two power plants, a chlorine gas leak at a chemical plant and an explosion at a missile production factory at a military complex in Tehran. Some Iranian officials have said privately that they suspect that at least some of the fires and explosions were part of an American and Israeli military campaign against Iran, but no official has publicly said whether any of the incidents are linked or blamed any country or group for them. Some analysts speculate that various enemies of the Iranian government — not just the United States and Israel but possibly domestic groups as well — may be seizing the opportunity to stoke chaos. “There is a belief that those who want regime change in Iran are throwing everything they have at Iran to see which one would stick,” said Foad Izadi, a conservative political analyst in Tehran. The waves of explosions and fires, he said, are “creating this sense of instability and chaos and insecurity.” No casualties were reported from the shipyard fire on Wednesday. Local officials said the flames were so extensive that they had to call in additional fire engines from the navy, the Revolutionary Guards Corp and a nearby nuclear plant. The fire was tamed after about five hours, local media reported. Jahangir Dehghan, Bushehr’s top crisis official, said the cause of the fire was unclear but that high winds and the fiberglass used in boat construction had contributed to its rapid spread, according to the Tasnim news agency. Fiberglass, however, is not generally flammable. While government officials have not linked the fires and explosions, they have acknowledged that the number and frequency are unusual. Aside from military and industrial fires, more than 1,100 forest fires in the past three months have burned more than 150 square miles of woodlands. Parliament called in the ministers of environment and intelligence to question them about the forest fires, at least a fifth of which were believed to been caused by arson. Many Iranians and some officials suspect that the fires and explosions are part of a coordinated covert operation by the United States and Israel to pressure the Islamic Republic government to negotiate a new nuclear deal, or to provoke a military confrontation. The July 2 explosion at Natanz was part of a yearlong covert operation by Israel and the United States, American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials have said. Intelligence officials said the blast may have set the Iranian nuclear program back as much as two years. Israel and the United States have sabotaged Iran’s nuclear program in the past. But officials from both countries said they had nothing to do with the explosion at a missile production facility near Tehran in late June. But there have been so many things burning or blowing up that Iranians are suspicious of everything. “Nobody believes these incidents are an accident even if they really are accidents,” said Abbas Abdi, a reformist analyst in Tehran. He said he thought the aim of these attacks was to project the sense that Iran’s government was losing control and to encourage opposition supporters inside Iran to rise up. For many Iranians, anticipating what will blow up next has become a kind of parlor game. Majid, a 63-year-old business owner in Tehran’s bazaar who asked that his last name not be used, said morning greetings with fellow shopkeepers are followed by speculation about what will explode or burn that day. Hossein, a writer in Tehran who also asked his last name not be used, said that when he took a taxi last week, the driver quizzed the passengers about which sites had exploded and which they predicted would be next. In the absence of a clear culprit or claim of responsibility, the government has been struggling to respond. Analysts said some of the episodes had clearly demonstrated that there were security gaps and intelligence moles within Iran’s most secure nuclear and military sites as well as industrial complexes. Not responding to sabotage risks appearing weak and vulnerable, while retaliating could set off a military confrontation that could be costly and painful. Some officials also fear that a war could improve President Trump’s re-election prospects. Hence the government has said little about the fires and explosions that have damaged a military base in Birjand, the state broadcasting headquarters in Tehran, a port near Bandarlengeh, a steel plant in Ahwaz and a petrochemical plant in Mahshahrtaken, to name a few episodes that took place over just five days last month. Instead, the government is embracing what one official calls “strategic patience.” “Iran is neither prepared nor wants a war,” Mr. Abdi said. “The reason it won’t even acknowledge publicly that they are sabotage is to save face and not be cornered into a response.” But if the attacks escalate, analysts said, a military response would be inevitable.']","Iranian officials say that some of the explosions at factories and military facilities, and some forest fires, may have been sabotage but blamed weather and accidents for the others."
"A ‘Significant Return to Normality’ by Christmas, U.K. Prime Minister Says",2020-07-17,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Stadiums and concert venues in England may reopen in the fall, but nightclubs will remain closed. All schools will welcome students by September, but wedding receptions will be limited to 30 people. And while pubs and restaurants reopened in England earlier this month, the local authorities will be granted new powers to close them when coronavirus cases flare. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain laid out a road map on Friday to simultaneously ease lockdown restrictions and to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the coming months, the steps toward reopening came with a clear warning: There will not be a “significant return to normality” until November at the earliest, and “possibly in time for Christmas.” Britain has suffered more than any other European country from the coronavirus, with more than 45,000 dead and nearly 300,000 infected, although it has succeeded in significantly reducing the number of casualties after they rose sharply in April and into May. Still, the lockdown has delivered a brutal jolt to businesses large and small, with at least 650,000 jobs lost in the first months of the pandemic, and the country expected to register its largest decline in annual G.D.P. in 300 years. Now, as the country braces for a second wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Johnson is walking something of a tightrope as he tries to restart the economy — people will no longer be encouraged to work from home starting next month — while also ensuring that the country’s health service is not overwhelmed. “I know some will say this plan is too optimistic, that the risks are too great and that we won’t overcome the virus in time,” Mr. Johnson add at a news conference from Downing Street. Britain should “hope for the best,” he added, but “plan for the worst.” The changes he announced on Friday apply only to England, as Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have broad latitude to set their own guidelines in response to the pandemic. In discussing what will, and what won’t, be possible in the coming weeks and months, Mr. Johnson made clear that until a vaccine was widely available and there are no upticks of new cases, Britons should be prepared to bounce back and forth between eased restrictions and new shutdowns. “The timetable I am about to set out is conditional,” Mr. Johnson said. “It is contingent on every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly.” Any changes in the future, however, are likely to be localized, Mr. Johnson said, as England moves from “blanket, national measures,” to “targeted” action. The local authorities will be granted extended powers to cancel events or close public spaces if they face outbreaks, as was the case with Leicester, 100 miles north of London, where a second lockdown was imposed. On Friday, Mr. Johnson also announced that the government would provide an additional three billion pounds ($3.75 billion) for Britain’s revered National Health Service, which was the subject of widespread adulation even as the government was accused of mishandling the crisis. “We are making sure we are ready for winter, and planning for the worst,” Mr. Johnson said. Maybe more than in any other European country, opposition politicians, experts and organizations in Britain have denounced the authorities’ response to the pandemic as riddled with flaws and false promises. Britain has been one of the worst-hit countries in the world as the pandemic has disproportionately affected minorities, devastated its nursing homes, and exacerbated concerns about the economic prospects of a no-deal Brexit. A plan to track coronavirus infections has largely failed, and Mr. Johnson’s announcements have left many baffled. When Mr. Johnson’s top aide, Dominic Cummings, flouted lockdown measures, the outcry turned against the prime minister, just months after his Conservative Party won parliamentary elections by a landslide. Mr. Johnson struck a careful tone on Friday as he announced that the authorities would soon stop encouraging people to work from home. It would be up to companies to craft plans for a gradual return to work. “Instead of government telling people to work from home, we are going to give employers more discretion, and ask them to make decisions about how their staff can work safely,” he said. Mr. Johnson’s announcements also paved the way for the potential reopening of West End theaters, although operators have long said that hosting an audience while maintaining social distancing would not be viable. In England, pubs and restaurants were allowed to begin hosting patrons inside again earlier this month, and indoor gyms and pools will be able to reopen next week, at the same time that masks will become compulsory in shops and supermarkets.']","“Hoping for the best but planning for the worst,” Boris Johnson said as he announced a road map for reopening England, and granted local authorities extended powers to tackle regional outbreaks."
Opposition Challenges Poland’s Presidential Election Results,2020-07-16,By Marc Santora,"['WARSAW — Supporters of the mayor of Warsaw, joined by scores of Polish voters and rights groups, raced on Thursday to file legal challenges to the validity of Sunday’s presidential election, which he narrowly lost to the incumbent, President Andrzej Duda. The rush to file the complaints was the result of a new electoral code passed by the government in May, cutting the time to file such challenges from 14 days to three. In lodging the official protests with the nation’s Supreme Court, supporters of the mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, were not expecting to overturn the result of the election, given the margin of defeat of nearly half a million votes. Their object was more to expose what they said was a pattern of political interference that marred the country’s closest election since the end of communist rule in 1989 and to delay the certification of the vote long enough for it to be declared invalid. If nothing else, the challenges will pose a test for a court system that has undergone sweeping changes since the governing Law and Justice party came to power five years ago. The government has been accused of undermining judicial independence and theoretically faces the prospect of becoming the first nation in the European Union to lose its voting rights. Joanna Lemanska, the head of the Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs Chamber of the Supreme Court, which will rule on the validity of the election, was appointed by Mr. Duda. She suggested that she would step aside but has yet to do so. Even if she does recuse herself, critics believe the special chamber is no longer an impartial arbiter of the law. But by overwhelming the judges with complaints, they hope to make it impossible for the judges to certify the results with the required 21 days. Mr. Trzaskowski, who has not commented on the legal challenges, is scheduled to give a speech in the northern port city of Gdynia on Friday, where he will try to rally supporters against the government. Borys Budka, the head of the main opposition party, Civic Platform, said on Thursday that there was growing evidence that the election was deeply flawed. “These elections were not equal, didn’t meet democratic standards, they were dishonest,” he said. “Because of that, we demand that they are declared invalid.” The most widespread irregularities were reported by the Polish diaspora, with tens of thousands of votes from abroad potentially left uncounted. But there were also reports of strange results in a number of nursing homes, which reported Mr. Duda winning 100 percent of the vote, and concerns about extra ballots sent to polling stations without proper documentation. Cezary Tomczyk, the head of the mayor’s campaign team, said they had received reports from all around Poland of ballots that were not properly stamped. “The election result is not just a simple statement of who won but also showing respect for every vote which was cast and or which couldn’t be cast,” he said in an interview on TVN24, a Polish broadcaster. “We don’t know the scale of irregularities. This can only be determined by the Supreme Court.” His team set up a web page to help voters file protests, and he said several thousand had already been registered. Some of the most troubling reports came from overseas, where a record 520,000 people had registered to vote before the election but only 415,951 ballots were counted. Complaints filed with the court charge that the Polish Foreign Ministry worked to suppress the number of voters. In Britain, over 30,000 ballots — 16.6 percent — went missing, according to a calculation using public data by the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. With the voting done exclusively by mail in Britain because of the pandemic, Poland’s Foreign Ministry blamed the British Post Office and voters themselves for the problems. Mr. Trzaskowski won the vote there by a wide margin, securing 112,207 votes to Mr. Duda’s 32,067. In Germany, 11,500 ballots did not make it to the consulates on time to be counted, and similar problems were reported in other countries with large Polish populations. “We can expect a record number of election protests because these elections — in my view — have been carried out in an unjust manner,” said Michał Wawrykiewicz, a lawyer from the Free Courts Initiative and Committee for Defense of Justice. “Never before have such situations taken place. Never before have we been dealing with such a massive party propaganda in the public media, which also influenced the result of the elections.” Paulina Kieszkowska-Knapik, who joined her colleagues from the Initiative at the Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon to file their complaint, grew emotional over what she said was a deep injustice. “The original sin,” she said, “was holding the election during a pandemic.” That, she said, was itself a violation of the Constitution. Adam Bielan, the head of the Law and Justice election team, said the claims should be assessed by the Supreme Court, but that the review would not change the outcome. “The advantage of President Andrzej Duda over Rafał Trzaskowski is so big that even if there had been inconsistencies, they could concern voters of both candidates,” he was quoted as saying by Gazeta Prawna, a legal newspaper. Other party officials did not return calls seeking comment. As the deadline to file protests approached, volunteers from “Polonia Express,” a civic organization based in Britain, helped overseas voters to register complaints on time. Over 2,900 people joined a Facebook group called “Electoral protests — Polonia has the right to vote.” The grass-roots initiative created forms for voters to fill out citing abuses like the voting package arriving too late or not at all. Separately, protests were filed over the use of state television to bolster the Duda campaign. The Supreme Court’s handling of the protests will be closely watched. In the days between the first round of elections and the runoff contest on Sunday, the European Court of Justice heard arguments in one of several cases related to Poland’s changes in the judicial system, which critics said were designed to quash the courts’ independence. “The whole judiciary system of the E.U. cannot work if courts are not independent,” Michal Gajdus said in the European court, which is based in Luxembourg. Since 1989, judges in Poland had been selected by the National Council of the Judiciary. But in 2017, Mr. Duda signed into law changes that critics said would enable the president to appoint judges sympathetic to the Law and Justice party. The changes led the European Commission to trigger Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union, the so-called nuclear option that could result in Poland losing its voting rights. But since that would require a unanimous vote by all 27 E.U. member countries, it is not likely to happen. Monika Pronczuk and Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting.']","Critics say both the campaign and the vote were plagued with irregularities and fraud. Amid a flurry of filings to the Supreme Court, the main opposition party called for the election to be declared invalid."
Southern Iraq’s Toxic Twilight,2020-07-16,"By Alissa J. Rubin, Clifford Krauss and Ivor Prickett","['Iraq is the rare country that imports gas but also burns natural gas from oil wells into the air. The wasted gas is enough to power three million homes. Burning it is making people sick. NAHRAN OMAR, Iraq — The men of Nahran Omar, a village in the heart of southern Iraq’s oil country, filed into a Shiite shrine clutching envelopes with X-rays, medical reports and death certificates. They had come to describe the misery they say is caused by the burning gas and chemicals spewing out of the oil wells in their village. Each one had a sick son or a dying wife, an ill brother or sister. “Imagine that in the town you come from every family has someone who has cancer,” said Khalid Qassim Faleh, a local tribal leader. “This is the situation in Nahran Omar.” The chemicals in the air — in Nahran Omar and other oil towns across southern Iraq — come from the smoky orange flames atop the oil wells, burning away the natural gas that bubbles up with the oil. Many countries have reduced the practice, known as flaring, in part because it wastes a precious resource. The amount of gas Iraq flares would be enough to power three million homes, according to the International Energy Agency. But flaring also produces chemicals that can pollute the air, land and water. It has been shown to worsen asthma and hypertension, contribute to the incidence of some cancers and speed climate change. Iraq, however, still flares more than half the natural gas produced by its oil fields, more than any other country except Russia. The practice contributes to Iraq’s bizarre energy paradox: A country with some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves faces a chronic power shortage and frequent blackouts. To feed its gas-powered electricity plants during the long, hot summers, it has to import gas, which it buys primarily from Iran. “Iraq could be self-sufficient,” said Ali al-Saffar, the head of the Middle East and North Africa division of the Paris-based International Energy Agency. “Instead it’s in a league of its own: It is unique because it flares gas at the same time that it imports it.” As Iraq’s economy craters under the twin assault of collapsing oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, it can ill afford the several billion dollars a year it spends buying gas from Iran. The purchases also undercut American sanctions on Iran aimed at preventing it from selling oil and gas. Iraqi officials acknowledge the need to reduce flaring but say that efforts to build expensive plants and pipelines to recapture gas from oil wells have been hindered by war and now by the dire economy. After the Islamic State seized a third of the country in 2014, the battle against it required every bit of government revenue for several years. In the last six months, crashing oil prices have deprived the government of its main source of revenue and the coronavirus pandemic has shut down much of the economy. “So, OK, we respect people’s criticism,” said Iraq’s former oil minister, Thamer Ghadban. “But let them come here and try to operate oil and gas plants under these circumstances.” For years, recapturing the gas was not a priority, given the country’s seemingly endless oil supply and, until recently, fat oil profits. But that is changing, officials say. After years of delays, Iraq opened a large recapture plant in Basra in 2018 at a cost of an estimated $1.5 billion, according to oil industry experts. But the plant is only a first step: it recovers a little more than half of the gas from three large oil fields. There are 15 oil fields in Basra Province alone. The Oil Ministry announced plans last month  to develop plants that would recover most of the gas that is now flared in southern Iraq. Mr. Ghadban said the projects would be operational in two to three years. International energy experts say that given Iraq’s economic troubles, those projections are wildly optimistic. Flying into Basra at night looks like a descent into Dante’s inferno: spires of flame cast pools of orange light in the darkness. A sizzling city — summer temperatures regularly exceed 120 Fahrenheit  — of nearly three million people in Iraq’s southeastern corner, Basra and the surrounding province hold 60 percent of Iraq’s proven oil reserves. But it was not the temperature that startled listeners of a morning weather forecast last August. “We are sounding the alarm,” the weatherman said in what has become a familiar refrain. “Today there are poisonous gases in the skies of southern Iraq that can harm people. The poisonous gases are a result of oil and car exhaust.” Gas flaring is not the only cause of pollution in the oil-rich southeast. Petrochemical plants, aging sewage plants, uranium from degrading weapons and matériel from recent wars all contribute to what Shukri Hassan, a professor of environment at the University of Basra, calls “a cocktail of pollutants.” “The air quality is really bad, water quality is also very poor, and there are many problems with the soil,” he said. “All of that makes Basra not a livable place.” Flaring also wreaks havoc on the environment. Iraqi flaring releases as much as 30 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, nearly 10 percent of the flaring emissions of the greenhouse gas worldwide. At the same time, flaring wastes clean-burning gas Iraq could use in its power plants, increasing its reliance on dirty oil-based fuel and compounding the environmental damage. Iraq has decent environmental laws on the books, but no one enforces them, said Ali Shaddad al-Fares, a local builder and entrepreneur who heads the provincial council’s oil and gas committee. “The oil companies have committed to protect the environment but there is no government enforcement. It is their job to protect the people, but they aren’t doing it.” An hour outside of Basra, the village of Nahran Omar offers a glimpse of the special hell of life amid an oil field. The village, population about 1,500, comprises three hamlets along the banks of the Tigris River as it widens out before emptying into the Persian Gulf. The government found oil and built the first well there in the 1960s. Today five wells dominate the eastern end of the village. The wells pump out a mix of oil, water and gas, primarily methane. The oil is channeled into tanks and pipelines to the port at Um Qasr. The oil-tainted water drains into a pond on the village’s outskirts, killing any life there. Nothing lives in the water, no grasses or plants grow nearby, even the desert birds avoid perching too close to it. Flaring is just a cheap way to get rid of the methane, which would otherwise be an explosive hazard. Many oil-producing countries, including the United States, flare gas, but rarely close to homes. In Nahran Omar, the flares roar day and night, kicking out so much heat that the faces of people who live nearby look permanently sunburned. The leaves of nearby trees curl brown on the sides that face the flares. Children born in Nahran Omar in the past decade have never known silence nor seen a dark night sky because the flares cast an unending, brilliant light over the surrounding landscape. “We cannot breathe here,” said Beshir Aude el-Jabber, the village mukhtar or community leader. “If you want to breathe, you have to drive away from our village. For the children it is especially hard, their lungs are small. For the old people too, it is hard because their lungs are weak.” The flares produce what the locals call oil rain, an oily precipitate made from the amalgam of water and hydrocarbons that do not completely burn during flaring and which, as it cools, absorbs water in the humid atmosphere. The breezes off the nearby Tigris carry the brew to nearby houses. “The oil rain from the flares destroyed our gardens and we cannot plant anymore,” Mr. el-Jabber said. “Sometimes when we get up early in the morning we see the oil rain on our clothes that were hanging out to dry for the night and our cars are spotted with it.” Oil is splattered on the corrugated metal roofs like pointillist paintings. The only way to remove it is with diesel fuel, Mr. el-Jabber said. Most families have a member who has had cancer. “My son died five years ago of lymphoma,” said Abu Beshir Nasir Shreggi, 58, a teacher. “He was an athlete and very strong. He was like all the kids, he liked soccer.” He pulled out his cellphone and showed a photo of a boy in a yellow soccer jersey. When his son got sick, Mr. Shreggi said he complained to a member of the provincial council, who suggested he send his son abroad for treatment. Mr. Shreggi laughed ruefully. “That would cost $50,000 and no one is going to give me the money,” he said. “And so my son is dead.” Epidemiologists say there is a relationship between intensive petroleum production and some cancers, but in a place like Basra, with multiple sources of pollution, it is hard to draw conclusions about causality. The mix of hydrocarbons in oil rain can be carcinogenic, said Dr. Marilyn Howarth, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology. “The oil itself can contain traces of heavy metals, arsenic and radioactivity, which could be a source of lung cancer,” she said. The byproducts of oil production can contribute to the risk of leukemia, lymphomas, myeloma, and kidney and bladder cancer, said Dr. Otis Brawley, a professor of oncology and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins. Oil workers may also be exposed to known carcinogens like asbestos, he said. The Basra office of the Ministry of Health says that the rates of cancer in southern Iraq are only marginally higher than those elsewhere in the country — “about the same as for the rest of the region,” said Dr. Abbas Tamimi, the head of the Basra Health Department. But he acknowledged that cancer deaths are underreported because of stigma attached to having cancer. Still, the number of cancer cases in Nahran Omar seems high by any standard, according to local politicians like Mr. Fares of the provincial oil and gas committee and cancer experts at Basra Hospital. Mr. el-Jabber, the mukhtar, who has kept a meticulous table of local cases, said that in the last six years, 54 residents have died and another 33 are suffering from some form of cancer. That means about 6 percent of the population has gotten cancer in that period. About half of those who died were under 25 years old, according to his records. In several instances two people in the same family died of cancer. The most prevalent cancers in Nahran Omar are lymphoma, kidney cancer and breast cancer. Dr. Brawley, who is familiar with some of the contaminants in southern Iraq, said that Nahran Omar “sounds like a cluster” but that without comparative studies it would be difficult to say whether cancer rates there are higher than normal. The villagers have turned to government and quasi-government agencies for help to no avail. Among them: the Basra Oil Company, a state owned enterprise that has a majority share in all oil production in southern Iraq; the provincial council’s oil and gas committee, which was recently eliminated; and the Basra branches of the Ministry of Health and Environment. Senior officials at each of those institutions acknowledge that flaring wastes energy and degrades the air quality. The Environment Ministry, which five years ago was merged with the Health Ministry, has levied numerous fines against the Basra Oil company for a variety of violations including flaring beyond the legal limit. But the company acknowledges that it is cheaper to pay the fines than to build another recapture plant, which can cost $1 billion or more. “The Ministry of Environment imposed many penalties against us, but it’s not easy to develop environmental protections because it requires so much investment,” said Khalid Hamza Abbas, the company’s senior chief engineer. “We have a plan to treat the gas, if we have the budget.” That is a big if. Iraq is now running a $2.5 billion deficit per month. And the plan would do little for the village of Nahran Omar. No recapture plant has been proposed for the five oil wells there. Despite the pollution and illness, no one there wants the oil wells to close. When residents demonstrated against the Basra Oil Company in 2018 it was to demand more jobs for local residents. The company hires very few locals once the wells are built. “We want you to employ us, to employ our sons,” Mr. Faleh, the tribal leader, said at his home on a sweltering evening. It was hot and sticky inside, and the electricity had gone off — a reminder that despite the oil and wealth being produced there, many locals see few benefits. Mr. Faleh struggled to explain his feelings: He suffers from breast cancer and expects that he will die of it in a few years. But if the oil wells are killing villagers, he said, at least the industry could provide a livelihood. “You see our lives are over,” he said. “We want to do something for our children.” Alissa J. Rubin reported from Nahran Omar, Iraq, and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad.']",
"Ending an Era, British Airways Retires Fleet of Boeing 747s",2020-07-17,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — British Airways will retire its entire fleet of Boeing 747 airplanes, the company said on Friday, citing the travel downturn and the aircraft’s high operating costs. The decision marked not just the finish of a storied plane’s service with the company but also symbolized the end of an era of aviation in which the next generation of planes was always expected to be bigger, as well as better. Even 50 years after their introduction, the sight of 747s gliding into their docks, dwarfing other planes, could evoke a thrill in the most jaded of travelers. The world’s first jumbo jet, known as the “Queen of the Skies,” the 747 revolutionized travel for the masses, but in recent years it had fallen out of favor with a number of airlines because of the costs. The final commercial flight of a Boeing 747 by an American carrier took place at the end of 2017. But British Airways had held on, operating the world’s largest fleet of the planes, with 31 in service. A handful of other commercial carriers still fly the 747, though their use is expected to further dwindle in the coming years. “It is with great sadness that we can confirm we are proposing to retire our entire 747 fleet with immediate effect,” British Airways said in a statement. “It is unlikely our magnificent ‘Queen of the Skies’ will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the Covid-19 global pandemic.” When the Boeing 747 began service in 1970, it was the height of modern travel technology, with room for 27 first class and 292 economy class passengers. Its iconic, humped upper deck, equipped with a lounge, or “club in the sky,” became synonymous with luxury travel. With a tail height equivalent to a six-story building and a wingspan equal to 50 parked cars, the 747 was part of a period of innovation that saw engineers develop larger and larger planes that could be filled with more passengers and in that way drive down ticket prices. But fuel costs in 1970 were so negligible that they were barely a factor in the airlines’ financial strategies. In recent years, advances in technology made the four-engine 747 far pricier to operate than modern twin-engine planes. The move is especially poignant for British Airways, which received its first Boeing 747-400 in 1989 and its last in April 1999. The predecessor of British Airways, BOAC, began flying versions of the 747 in the early 1970s. At the height of the craft’s deployment, British Airways had 57 of the jumbo jets and was the second-biggest operator of the planes, after Japan Airlines, which had more than 100 in its fleet. Some commercial carriers still operate passenger flights on the 747, including Air China, Korean Air and Lufthansa. A number of companies, including UPS, also use the 747 freighter to transport cargo. Other airlines have also recently retired their fleets, including Qantas of Australia, which accelerated plans to do so because of the coronavirus pandemic and held had a series of farewell flights for the last of its 747s this week. The final 747 in that airline’s fleet will depart Sydney later this month and be stored in the Mojave Desert in California. The last order for a passenger version of the 747 came from the U.S. government, which in 2017 commissioned two of the jets from Boeing for use by the president, as Air Force One aircraft. The planes — a repurposed version of the 747-8 — are scheduled for delivery in 2024. Bloomberg News reported this month that Boeing had quietly pulled the plug on production of the 747. Some parts of the British Airways fleet may fly again, with engine components and metal from the fuselage often stripped for other uses. For the most part, however, specialist companies are hired to dismantle and scrap planes that airlines no longer fly. British Airways was set to retire the last of its Boeing 747s in 2024, but as the coronavirus saw travel grind to a halt, threatening the finances of airlines the world over, that time frame was pushed forward. British Airways has been a company in crisis since the pandemic began, with the financial fallout threatening thousands of jobs. In April, the carrier’s parent, the Madrid-based International Airlines Group, announced plans to restructure British Airways that could result in up to 12,000 people losing their jobs.']",The disruption of travel during the coronavirus pandemic hastened the company’s plans to pull the iconic aircraft from commercial service.
"Melbourne Lockdown Elicits Hope, Anger and Vows of Resilience",2020-07-17,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau.  Last week’s letter, about the mood in Melbourne during our second strict lockdown, prompted a flood of feedback from readers. People shared with us how they’re coping, thanked us for mirroring their perspective and criticized us for a lack of self-awareness. Here is a sampling of those reader responses: During the first lockdown, we were all truly “in this together.” Now it’s just metro Melbourne and the comments from the rest of the country do make it feel like we’ve done something wrong here, although I don’t think Melburnians have been more complacent than other parts of the country. Having gyms close again was really rough. The first time I went to the gym since they shut, I felt better than I had since March. That said, we’re going to get through this stronger. It was pretty likely that this was going to happen, so if we’re first in the country to get our second wave (I don’t think we’ll be the last), let’s get on with it. Last time, the never-ending uncertainty was rough, while at least now I can circle a date in the calendar.  — Kissairis Muñoz — I missed my 75th birthday celebrations with my extended family, and our 50th wedding anniversary celebrations, thanks to COVID-19 isolation. So sad. But then, there is next year to celebrate. Hopefully.  — Joe Slaven, Townsville, Australia — The piece on Melbourne was complete tripe that appears to be written by some poor soul with no resilience and nothing to do but lay about wallowing in their own self-pity. This is not reflective of all Melburnians and I’d suggest not really indicative of most Melbourne residents. Cozy “fires at the pub,” country trips in winter — what an idealistic load of rubbish doing nothing other than to paint an unrealistic picture of this city and it’s inhabitants!  — Mark Pepper — There is a stark difference between Lockdown 1.0 and Lockdown 2.0. The first time around it seemed that everyone was making an effort to find the funny, irreverent and touching moments to brighten all our days. Then as lockdown started to ease, ugliness started to creep in; in emotions, in behavior, in words, in government rhetoric. Now in Melbourne there is very deep anger, anxiety and a sense of division. So what do I do to try and remain positive? I am spending less time watching the news, catching highlights and then turning it off. I am dipping into loved books and making my way through a backlog of new potential favorites. I am walking — no matter the weather. This is not negotiable. I am trying to pick up the phone and have conversations instead of relying on texting and emails. I am touching base with my neighbors. I am much less inclined to do this than last time, which means it is more necessary. I am giving myself the freedom to drink as much coffee as I need to get through this.  — Michelle — Greetings from Houston, Texas, USA. I normally love these dispatches but this one gives me pause. We here would love concerns about oysters and champagne at home, missed sunny vacations and stalled pool laps. But instead we are grappling with issues associated with a corrupt federal government which refuses to protect its citizens, political debate pertaining to masks, a surging virus and economic collapse. The author’s complaints seem trite in comparison. I wish her concerns were the problems of this country. — Dana M. Gannon — It was great to read the letter from Besha because something shines out when somebody writes what is clearly the truth, the exact way she is feeling. I hope it engenders in all her readers, as it did for me, a feeling of sympathy, a kind of loving feeling — and I hope that she and her fellow Victorians discover something special and important in the next few weeks. Then, when it is all over, come up here to Queensland for a big hug.  — Michael — I have always found winter to be daunting (I grew up on the Connecticut shore — talk about gray, cold winters) and have generally huddled inside for 12 Melbourne winters. But this year is something different. After the vicious summer bushfires, the rain started, generous but not imposing. It has kept on for months, and now Melbourne is green and lush and sooooo gorgeous. With the help of recently purchased electric bikes, my partner and I have discovered a vast network of bike and walking paths from our base. Now those chilly days are simply *days* that we might discover a new route or revisit a favorite. I grieve for the lost connections and routines, and I am also deeply grateful to live in a country that cares about people, and I’m knocked off balance, and I’m worried about our collective mental health. What helps right the balance for me are the joys of wending along a lush path on a cool, bright afternoon, of seeing the full sky at sunset, and of breathing and moving through the world. And having someone to share both the lockdown and the exploration with — that makes most things just fine.  — Katherine Russell — Today’s letter, bathed in self-pity and almost entirely lacking perspective, is a paean to middle class self-centeredness.

China Is Using Uighur Labor to Produce Face Masks,2020-07-19,"By Muyi Xiao, Haley Willis, Christoph Koettl, Natalie Reneau and Drew Jordan","['As the coronavirus pandemic continues to drive demand for personal protective equipment, Chinese companies are rushing to manufacture the gear for domestic and global consumption. A New York Times visual investigation has found that some of those companies are using Uighur labor through a contentious government-sponsored program that experts say often puts people to work against their will. Uighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the Xinjiang region of northwest China. The program sends Uighurs and other ethnic minorities into factory and service jobs. Now, their labor is part of the P.P.E. supply chain. According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51. After reviewing state media reports and public records, The Times found that at least 17 of those companies participate in the labor transfer program. The companies produce equipment primarily for domestic use, but The Times identified several other companies outside Xinjiang that use Uighur labor and export globally. We traced a shipment of face masks to a medical supply company in the U.S. state of Georgia from a factory in China’s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers had been sent. The workers are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their loyalty to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies. The program is widely publicized in state media as a form of poverty reduction. The Human Rights Investigations Lab at the University of California, Berkeley and the Uyghur Human Rights Project have both collected dozens of videos and social media reports that document the recent labor transfers. Uighurs have long been persecuted by the Chinese government, which says its tight control over Xinjiang is necessary to fight what it calls religious extremism. In a response to The Times, the spokesman for China’s Embassy in the U.S. said the program helps “local residents rise above poverty through employment and lead fulfilling lives.” Quotas on the number of workers put into the labor program and the penalties faced by those who refuse to cooperate, however, mean that participation is often, in effect, involuntary. “There are these coercive quotas that cause people to be put into factory work when they don’t want to be,” said Amy K. Lehr, the director of the Human Rights Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And that could be considered forced labor under international law.” Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.']","A Times video investigation identified Chinese companies using a contentious labor program for Uighurs to satisfy demand for P.P.E., some of which ended up in the United States and other countries."
"E.U. Leaders Meet to Discuss Virus Rescue Plan, With Obstacles Ahead",2020-07-17,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — European Union leaders gathered on Friday to start hammering out a giant aid package to help their economies recover from the coronavirus calamity. But even before they began, the haggling had exposed fundamental differences between member states that must be finessed in coming days if they are to succeed in saving Europe’s economy. The major sticking point is how much latitude to give those receiving the aid to spend it as they please. Since much of the money is  guaranteed by wealthier northern states, some of them are demanding that strings be attached to push economic, political, environmental and social reforms. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose nation recently took over the European Union’s rotating presidency and who has led efforts to push ahead with the package, previously sounded optimistic. But she was cautious as she arrived about the prospects of reaching a deal.  “It would be desirable but we must also face reality,” she said. “I expect very difficult negotiations,.” The  talks will continue at least into Saturday night, and no announcement is expected until then. It was the first time E.U. leaders held an in-person meeting since the outbreak of the pandemic that has upended so many of their plans, and officials hoped that being together would help them advance compromise faster. Video  showed them wearing masks and greeting each other with gentle bows and elbow-bumps. The leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia — who have most challenged the bloc’s liberal, democratic principles — broke ranks and posed together maskless. The logistics around organizing the meeting in the time of Covid-19 were cumbersome. Special floor markings indicated distancing and the preferred flow of officials in the building.  The leaders met in the biggest room in the new Europa building. It fits 300 people. Only the heads of 27 governments and the leaders of E.U. institutions were admitted. Earlier guidance had indicated that the leaders would be allowed on occasion to be visited by close advisers. But the usual dozen-plus entourage per leader is a thing of the past: they were limited to five advisers each.  The show of bonhomie disguised political pressures and longstanding cultural differences that have slowed the quest for a swift agreement  spearheaded by Ms. Merkel along with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. Familiar trenches are being dug. Some northern European countries led by the Netherlands want sweeping liberalization of southern countries’ economies and a reform of their public finances in exchange for stimulus. Most members from Europe’s west want Hungary, Poland and other eastern members to adhere to environmental targets, to stop eroding the rule of law and to end attacks on immigrants and minority groups such as their Jewish and L.G.B.T. citizens if they are to tap E.U. funds. The leaders will try to agree on 1.8 trillion euros in funding — about $2 trillion — of which just over €1.1 trillion will be allocated to the bloc’s budget for the next seven years, the normal way of setting out E.U. spending, and €750 billion will be separated out for a pandemic recovery fund. The recovery component under discussion includes a bold proposal that will enable the E.U. administrative branch, the European Commission, to borrow in the financial markets on a large scale and offer part of the funds it raises for free in the form of grants to needy members. In practice, that will mean more creditworthy E.U. nations will be underwriting loans to fund the recoveries of countries that would otherwise face  onerous borrowing costs. In combination with a European Central Bank program to buy member states’ debt at low interest rates to enable them to continue funding stimulus programs, the proposed €750 billion plan would be a major help to those most in need, especially in the European south where structurally weak economies were hammered by the coronavirus. Economists predict a recession unseen outside wartime in the region. Italy, Spain and France, the bloc’s third, fourth and second-largest economies, will suffer the most, clocking in contractions of around 10 percent each this year. Greece and other smaller economies that were recovering from the bloc’s last recession will also be badly affected by the downturn. But heavy debt loads in many of these nations make them reluctant to amass yet more debt, and their budgets aren’t sufficient to self-fund their recoveries, which leads them to turn to the European Union for help. Richer countries like Germany, which has played a catalytic role in forging compromise, stand to benefit from a fast and steady recovery in their weaker southern neighbors. They share a currency, the euro, and a common market for their goods and services. Germany’s shifting role, from leader of the conservative rich north to champion of compromise, could be the deciding factor in this new battle for the European Union. “Germany has made a visible differentiation of its position,” said Maria Demertzis, an economist and the deputy director of the Brussels-based research institute Bruegel. “It hasn’t forgotten issues of conditionality and reforms, but, for this moment, it’s reordering its priorities.” This leaves the northern nations to be led by the Dutch, who are demanding a role in scrutinizing how the money is spent by their peers, which Italy and others view as unacceptable encroachment on their business. They instead propose that the European Commission act as a fair arbiter of whether countries’ stimulus plans are wise and well designed.  Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who faces a close election in less than a year, wants his Parliament to have a say in the disbursement of funding, a view that no other nation shares. “I estimate the chance of us reaching an agreement this weekend is less than 50 percent,” Mr. Rutte said as he arrived at the meeting in Brussels on Friday morning, dimming hopes for a quick agreement. His insistence on strict conditions to the aid has irritated southern members, leading to tensions that are bound to play out in the negotiations. “To be fair, what the Dutch are saying isn’t wrong, when they raise issues of big debts, or flag that countries need to reform,” Ms. Demertzis said. “But the question is timing: Is this the conversation you want to be having right now? The diplomacy is not right, the substance is.”  It is far from certain that they’ll reach an agreement. It is possible, rather, that they continue their talks on Sunday and even reconvene later this month, but there is consensus that they should have an agreement before an August summer break. And while the proposed package includes mechanisms that would force countries to adhere to ambitious environmental goals and push them to improve the way they deal with their rule of law and minorities at home, certain eastern members object. “Linking those two areas, those two completely different legal areas, creates an enormous threat of legal certainty,” said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland as he arrived at the meeting. “We can’t agree to that.” In the run-up to the meeting, his ally Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary prepared for a similar battle, getting his Parliament to vote on a resolution stating that E.U. procedures against Hungary for rule-of-law violations must be closed before the new budget is adopted, and that funding shouldn’t be dependent on rule-of-law requirements.  The aid package under discussion will allow the European Commission to develop new muscles that will make it resemble a federal government more than ever before. But many members view the institution with suspicion because it is a vast bureaucracy with little democratic accountability. The commission has in the past used the E.U. budget to issue bonds, but never at the scale proposed, and never to then distribute those loans for free. The proposals stress that this will be a  one-time exercise to combat a disastrous recession. The proposals will also allow the commission to find ways to raise its own funds, for example through a tax on carbon emissions, digital services and other cross-border activities. If it goes ahead, the commission will be managing both spending and revenue sides of the E.U.  balance sheet, and will be given the authority to levy taxes, a privilege usually reserved for elected governments. “We need to see what comes out of the meetings, but if this passes, it is in the direction of the countries backstopping a grant: This is an incredible step forward,” said Ms. Demertzis. “Everyone is talking about this being a one-off, but as we all know, there’s nothing more permanent than temporary measures.” Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting from Brussels and Ben Novak contributed from Budapest.']",Domestic political pressures and longstanding cultural differences are putting a brake on Angela Merkel’s push for swift agreement.
Partyers Clash With German Police,2020-07-19,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Violence erupted overnight in Frankfurt between police officers and youths who have been partying in a central city square on weekends, with bars and clubs shuttered to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. It was the latest outbreak of violence involving the German police amid a national debate on bias and racial profiling in police ranks. “The mood turned against us,” Frankfurt’s police chief, Gerhard Bereswill, said Sunday at a news conference, adding that members of the crowd had fought with police officers. “Certain groups feel encouraged — above all when they have been drinking — to attack police,” he added. The violence in Frankfurt comes weeks after hundreds of young men clashed with the police and vandalized dozens of stores in Stuttgart. Coverage of the protests in the United States against police brutality and systemic racism has received widespread attention across Germany, encouraging immigrant groups here to speak up against what they say are years of being stopped by officers at random, based solely on their appearance or skin color. Police in Germany have long been widely respected by a majority of the public, but have come under sharper criticism and more frequent attacks since the protests that have swept the United States. Asked what he thought was behind the violence, Chief Bereswill said several elements had come together, including an aggressive mood fueled by alcohol, but also the public debate in Germany over racial profiling by police in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by an officer in Minneapolis in May. At least some of the 39 people initially detained in the melee came from a “migrant background,” the police said, without offering further details. “The accusation of racial profiling that is very present in society right now,” he said, adding that the issue of police violence in the United States “has spilled over to Germany and the German police are falsely being compared to the U.S. police.” “All of that came together and we feel that on the streets,” he said in an interview with Hessische Rundfunk public television. Last week, Horst Seehofer, Germany’s top security official, rejected calls for his ministry to conduct a study into structural racism among the country’s police officers, insisting that he saw no indications among the federal force that racial profiling was a problem. Instead, he said his ministry would follow through on an investigation of extremism and racism in the public sector that had already been commissioned. “For weeks, the police have been under strong criticism, and I would like to see us return to a fact-based discussion,” Mr. Seehofer told the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. “To do this, we need an overview of extremism, anti-Semitism and racism in the whole of the public sector.” Opernplatz, the square outside Frankfurt’s opera house, where violence broke out overnight, has become the scene of regular weekend parties this summer, with thousands of people gathering around a fountain to socialize, drink and dance. About 3,000 people were there on Saturday night, a racially mixed crowd of diverse ages and economic backgrounds. The celebrations remained largely peaceful until about 3 a.m. Sunday, when a fight broke out among about two dozen revelers still in the square, Chief Bereswill said. When a group of 10 officers moved in to give first aid to an injured person, some in the crowd turned on them and began pelting them with bottles and glasses. Others cheered as the glass flew, he said, and five officers were injured. The Frankfurt police said that eight of the 39 people who were detained remained in custody on Sunday. The authorities in Frankfurt are investigating those eight, all aged 17 to 21, on suspicion of attacking officers and vandalizing public property. A video published on the website of the local radio station FFH showed a crowd roaring approval when a man wielding a trash can succeeded in smashing the glass at a bus stop at the edge of the square. The city authorities had set up hundreds of temporary trash cans and portable toilets to prevent the pileup of empty bottles and other trash left on the square in recent weeks. “Our Opera Square is dedicated to ‘The True Beautiful Good,’” Omid Nouripour, a lawmaker for the Greens who grew up in Frankfurt, wrote on Twitter. “Not idiots who injure police, vandalize bus stations and destroy everything for peaceful revelers.”']",Tensions are running high in the country amid a national debate on racial profiling in police ranks.
India Coronavirus Cases Surge Past One Million,2020-07-17,By Karan Deep Singh and Jeffrey Gettleman,"['NEW DELHI — India hit a milestone on Friday morning  that it had made great sacrifices to avoid: recording more than one million coronavirus infections. The virus has been gnawing its way across this country of 1.3 billion people and gaining speed, fueled by high population density, an already beleaguered health care system and a calculation by the central government to lift a nationwide lockdown in hopes of getting the economy up and running, come what may. But as India’s number of confirmed new infections keeps hitting record highs, many states and cities have been locking down again. In some areas, long lines of bodies snake out of cremation grounds. India is now racking up about 30,000 new reported infections each day — more than any other country except the United States and Brazil, and it is catching up to Brazil. India now has the third-highest total cases — 1,003,832 cases and 25,602 deaths —  after the United States and Brazil. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate that by the end of next year, India will be the worst-hit country in the world. “We have paid a price for laxity,” said K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, a nonprofit organization of public health experts and academics. About 25,000 deaths have been officially attributed to Covid-19, but testing remains sparse, so the real figure could be significantly higher. Schools and universities have been shut since March with no clear plans to reopen, leaving nearly 278 million students without much to do. The central government recently advised school systems to limit online learning to a few hours a day. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, India’s minister for human resource development, said this was required to make sure that students didn’t get “overly stretched or stressed.” More than 100 million Indians have lost their jobs. The economy, which already had been showing deep cracks before the pandemic, is now forecast to contract by as much as 9.5 percent in the year that began on April 1, a stunning reversal from the last decade, when India had one of the hottest economies on earth. In the early days of the pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took swift action. He advised masks and social distancing. At a time when India had fewer than 1,000 known infections — though the true figure was certainly higher — he imposed a severe nationwide lockdown that would last nearly three months. Millions of migrant laborers, who over the years had gravitated to jobs in the cities, suddenly found themselves with little or no work. They poured out of the cities and back into the countryside, hoping to rely on relatives in their home villages to survive. In the process, they spread coronavirus infections into nearly every corner of India. As the economic pain really began to bite, Mr. Modi changed course. Last month he urged the leaders of India’s 28 states and 8 territories to “unlock, unlock, unlock.” Public health experts say Mr. Modi got it backward and should have waited until the crisis was further along, and then imposed a strict lockdown. The early lockdown was “premature and it did nothing” because the virus hadn’t spread at the time, said Dr. Anand Krishnan, a professor of epidemiology at the New Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “Now is the time to impose such drastic public health measures.” The worst hit areas are India’s biggest cities, like Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad and the tech hub of Bengaluru. The crowded urban areas, where many families live eight or even ten people per room, make social distancing nearly impossible, hastening the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus. Officials in India’s northeastern state of Bihar imposed a two-week lockdown beginning Thursday after a sudden spike in cases — more than 20,000 in 24 hours. Bihar is a source of migrant labor across India; the surge in Bihar’s cases correlates with the return of workers from distant cities. A sharp rise in cases has also forced a new lockdown in Goa, a state on India’s western coast that is famed for its beaches, just a few weeks after it reopened to tourists, a lifeline to the state economy. The southern state of Kerala, which had been largely successful in controlling the spread of the virus, also extended lockdown restrictions by a week in its biggest city, Thiruvananthapuram, after cases nearly doubled in just a few days. “We need more focus on the new COVID-19 hot spot in South Asia,” said a statement from John Fleming, an official with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “Lives of people in India are no less valuable than people in other parts of the world.” Mr. Modi and top government officials have repeatedly said in televised speeches that India is doing better than richer countries, especially when it comes to the death rate. India has reported about 20 coronavirus-related deaths per million people, while many other nations, including the United States, Brazil, Spain, Italy have all lost hundreds per million. “I don’t think it has anything to do with how the government has handled the pandemic,” Dr. Krishnan said. Instead, he said, it’s because India’s average age is younger than that of other countries, and obesity and diabetes, which increase people’s vulnerability to the virus, are less prevalent here. The Indian Medical Association, said that Covid-19 has killed 99 doctors. “If Covid mortality has to be lessened, it has to start with doctors,” the organization said in a news release Wednesday. Public health experts say India still lacks a transparent and robust mechanism to respond to a crisis of this magnitude. And what’s needed, they say, is a vigorous and energetic response from both the government and citizens. “Opening malls and allowing large religious gatherings is not the way,” said Mr. Reddy. “You can’t give the virus a highway to travel.”']",Several states and cities have reimposed total and partial lockdowns as the pandemic accelerates. India now ranks third in the world in infections.
Kuwait Says 91-Year-Old Emir Had ‘Successful’ Surgery,2020-07-19,By The Associated Press,"['DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The 91-year-old emir of Kuwait underwent a “successful” surgery on Sunday that required the crown prince of the oil-rich nation to be temporarily empowered to serve in his place, its state-run news agency reported. Kuwait has yet to explain why the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, needed to seek a previously unannounced medical treatment beginning Saturday. However, Sheikh Sabah’s sudden surgery could renew a power struggle within Kuwait’s ruling family. The state-run KUNA news agency had described Sheikh Sabah’s hospitalization on Saturday as “medical checks,” citing a statement from the country’s royal court. Several hours later, KUNA published a second report saying that the 83-year-old crown prince, Nawaf Al al-Ahmad al-Sabah, had assumed some of Sheikh Sabah’s powers temporarily, without explaining why that was necessary. But a copy of the ministerial decree posted by Kuwait’s official gazette, Kuwait Al-Youm, and seen by The Associated Press on Sunday said the crown prince would be empowered for “the duration of a surgical procedure until the health event is over.” The decree did not elaborate. Kuwait’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though minutes later the state-run KUNA news agency reported Sheikh Sabah underwent a “successful” surgery, without elaborating. “May God bless his highness and grant him a speedy recovery,” the KUNA report said, citing a royal court statement. Sheikh Sabah, a widely beloved ruler, took power in 2006 just nine days into the rule of the ailing Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah. Concerns mounted during Sheikh Saad’s brief reign as he was seen in public only in a wheelchair and did not speak. However, Sheikh Sabah’s ascension upset an informal power-sharing arrangement between branches of Kuwait’s ruling family. The country has since remained politically stable with the most-empowered parliament of any Gulf Arab nation, but there have been internal power struggles behind the scenes of his rule. Kuwait, a nation of 4.1 million people, has the world’s sixth-largest known oil reserves. It has been a staunch U.S. ally since the 1991 Gulf War expelled the occupying Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein. Today, Kuwait hosts some 13,500 American troops, many at Camp Arifjan south of Kuwait City, which is also home to the forward command of U.S. Army Central.']","No further explanation was given for the procedure, which could renew a power struggle in the Gulf nation’s ruling family."
"Fighting Discrimination, a French Woman Becomes a Champion of Men",2020-07-17,By Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — Standing on a truck, her fist clenched high and her back turned to a row of police vans, Assa Traoré galvanized the crowd before her. “You are powerful!” she shouted, to the cheers of thousands who had gathered on the Place de la République in central Paris to protest police violence and racism. “Your faces have been seen all over the world!” Until just a few weeks ago, Ms. Traoré, 35, a special-education teacher of Malian descent, was largely known as the spokeswoman for The Truth for Adama, an advocacy group that has demanded justice for her half brother, Adama Traoré, who died in police custody in 2016 on his 24th birthday. But now, with the spread of Black Lives Matter protests, she has gained wider prominence as the champion of men who have been victims of discriminatory police violence in France. Ms. Traoré said that men in minority neighborhoods are more likely to be targeted by the police than women — and as a woman, she could help defend them by taking a stand where she was least expected. “With my female voice, we’re going to make these men visible and give them a voice,” Ms. Traoré said in an interview in her apartment in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing in the United States, which triggered a wave of anger that spanned the world, Ms. Traoré and her group have organized some of the biggest anti-racism protests in Europe. They assembled at least 20,000 protesters in front of a Paris courthouse early in June despite a police ban, then a crowd of 15,000 just 11 days later on the Place de la République. Protesters in recent weeks have included more white people and people from upper-class areas of Paris, Ms. Traoré said, as compared with the first demonstrations for Adama, back in 2016, which were mainly attended by people of color. “That’s when we thought: ‘This is it, the fight for Adama has become a popular fight,’” Ms. Traoré said. Ms. Traoré speaks with resolve. “France has not come to terms with its history, with slavery, with colonization,” she said. “These are unsaid things that leave traces, and we suffer the consequences.” France has struggled to confront racism for years. The Paris suburbs exploded in riots in 2005, driven by resentment among North African immigrants over their treatment by the police and discrimination in general, exposing the rest of France to the country’s racial fissures. France, which colonized parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, has failed to fully integrate immigrants from its former empire. Some of that is rooted in its commitment to universalism — a belief that no group should be given preference, but one that critics say has muted discussion and shielded the country from facing its colonial legacy. Ms. Traoré’s words have struck a chord among the younger generation, who have flocked to the protests. “She’s clear, and that makes her strong,” said Djenaba Dramé, a 21-year-old Black student at the demonstration on the Place de la République. Christiane Taubira, who in 2012 became the first Black woman to be named Justice Minister, has called her “a chance for France.” By all accounts, Ms. Traoré is a charismatic figure, easily identifiable as she rouses the crowd in her black T-shirt bearing the words “Justice for Adama. Without justice, you will never have peace.” She wears it almost daily. Born in Paris in 1985, Ms. Traoré draws on a family history in both France and Mali. Two of her great-grandfathers fought alongside French troops during World War II, when Mali was still a French colony, and her father, Mara-Siré Traoré, emigrated from Mali to France at age 17. Ms. Traoré is one of 17 siblings in a close-knit family where conversations were conducted in a blend of French, Soninke and Bambara languages. Her father married four women — two white Catholics whom he divorced and then two Malian Muslims with whom he lived at the same time, as permitted by Islamic law, despite the ban on polygamy in France. When he died of cancer in 1999, Ms. Traoré was 14. As the eldest child still at home, she took over the reins of the family, filling in for her mother, Hatouma, who did not speak fluent French, while continuing her studies to become a special-education teacher. “She took on an almost motherly role with my brothers and sisters,” said Lassana Traoré, 43, one of her oldest half brothers, who saw this experience as the foundation of her leadership today. Ms. Traoré said that helping boys in disadvantaged suburbs as part of her work in special education made her realize that Black and Arab men — whom she called “our brothers” — were targeted by the police when they became teenagers, a phenomenon that Human Rights Watch documented in a report last month. “Saying that men matter, that their voices count is part of our struggle,” Ms. Traoré said. “We must keep fighting so that all women around the world can have the rights they deserve. But who’s fighting, who’s defending our men?” She said that she drew inspiration from “Les Misérables,” the Oscar-nominated movie of the French film director Ladj Ly that depicts police violence against Black and Arab teenagers in a Paris suburb. “If those men had been more visible, perhaps my brother wouldn’t be dead today,” she added. Adama, her half brother, died in the courtyard of a police station on July 19, 2016, in circumstances that are still in dispute. Mr. Traoré was pinned down by three police officers, one of whom later acknowledged placing “the weight of all our bodies” on him, during an identity check that went awry. Mr. Traoré reportedly said that he could not breathe and likely passed out during his transfer to the police station in Persan, a small town north of Paris, where he was pronounced dead two hours later. Conflicting autopsies pointed to heart failure or asphyxiation as the cause of the death, but after much investigation there is still no clear picture of what happened. No charges have been filed against the officers whom the Traoré family accuse of having killed Adama. “I told myself that his death could not remain a minor news story,” Ms. Traoré said. “We could not forget him and just pretend, ‘Here’s another guy who died over the summer.’” Ms. Traoré said that the video of Mr. Floyd’s killing has helped “illustrate” what happened to her half brother. “People now understand how my brother died,” she said. But, she added, “If there hadn’t been this big organizational effort before, George Floyd’s death wouldn’t have made any difference.” With the help of seasoned anti-racist, left-wing activists, Ms. Traoré has worked to turn her advocacy group into a movement, keeping politicians at bay and relying mostly on social networks that keep her phone buzzing all the time. She has nearly 400,000 Instagram followers. Julien Talpin, a sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research, said that she had become “a central political figure” with whom many Black people, feeling neglected by French political parties, can easily identify. Ms. Traoré’s activism has infuriated French right-wing news media, which accuse her of trying to tear French society apart by pitting Black and white communities against each other. It has also put her at odds with the French authorities. She recently filed a libel suit against the Paris police chief and declined an invitation by the former justice minister, Nicole Belloubet, for a meeting, arguing that “justice should not be done in a tearoom at the Élysée Palace.” “A confrontation has been established,” Ms. Traoré said. “It’s a small victory.

The Community That Covid-19 Built,2020-07-17,By Catherine Porter,"['The wagon on Jennifer Ois’s front porch is a symbol of the coronavirus’s silver lining. It’s red and wooden, with black rubber wheels that once fell off, when Ms. Ois was towing her first child and a frozen turkey home from a store many years ago. These days, the wagon is crowded with homemade things like fermented turmeric soda, ginger-berry kefir water, lemongrass ice cream and fresh lettuce from the garden, all waiting to be picked up by a neighbor. “Now it’s got a whole other purpose,” says Ms. Ois. It’s carrying kindness down her street. Since visiting her neighborhood on Hiawatha Road a few weeks ago, I’ve returned to it many times in my mind. I find it comforting. It reminds me that despite the virus’s darkness, it has offered some illumination — a slowing of time and a return to life’s essentials. The people on this street have used that time to learn old-fashioned skills like fermentation and growing vegetables, and in the process they’ve become a community. They’ve been lucky, too — while some on the street have lost employment to the virus, this part of the city has been relatively unscathed by Covid-19 infections and deaths. The street is classic east-end Toronto — three long blocks of houses huddled together, as if for warmth. It was once part of a 600-acre farm owned by the Ashbridges, an English Quaker family from Pennsylvania who fled to Canada as Loyalists after the American Revolution. It remained a farm outside the city limits for more than a century, until the land was parceled and sold off — for shacks for the immigrating poor and for planned subdivisions. Walking down the street, you can see the signs of that history in the architecture — old working-class bungalows wedged beside gentrified two-story brick homes. You can also see locals homesteading in ways that Sarah Ashbridge, the matriarch of the Quaker settlers, would likely recognize. Ms. Ois is known locally as the “fer-mentor.” On her stove, a pot of water, grated ginger and molasses cools next to her “ginger bug” — the makings for ginger ale. Her slow cooker is warming milk for yogurt. She pulls colorful jars out of her “fermenting cupboard” — homemade vinegars, kombuchas and pickles. For many years, she bugged her neighbors to try her hobby, but they were too busy, rushing from work to children’s hockey practices. When the country went into lockdown in March, she found a captive audience with long days to fill and anxiety to expend. “When this all happened, everyone else came into my world,” said Ms. Ois, 43, a stay-at-home parent. “Many said, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ Well, I know what to do. I’m an expert at it.” She offered kombucha scobies, sourdough starter, and seeds for her neighbors’ nascent vegetable patches. She left them all in the wagon on her front porch, and texted pictures of her handwritten recipes. Just down the street, Guillermo del Aguila had set up a hydroponics nursery in his basement for the first time, to supply the seedlings for his family’s backyard greenhouse. He was better at it than he expected. He joined in the exchange, issuing his own community offerings: eggplant, sweet pepper, tomato and leek seedlings. Jon Harris lives a few doors down. Both he and his wife had been deemed essential workers, so time had not stopped still for them. But he found making bread soothing. The baking section of grocery store shelves was bare, but he knew of a commercial mill and put out a call to the street. His first order was for 300 kilograms of flour and 25 pounds of yeast. “There’s something magical happening,” said Mr. Harris, 44, an electrician. He added, “I wonder if there is something about watching the world spin around you and thinking about your mortality. We have a little more space to grab onto the things we want to be important.” The trading and pioneer hobbies have continued, even as the city has begun slowly to open up. Ms. Ois set up a swap page on Facebook, and offers went up from neighbors for homemade granola, freezer strawberry jam, lavender, eggs, espresso syrup, bitters for cocktails. Deborah MacDonald ventured to the red wagon to pick up champagne yeast to make raspberry mead, with Ms. Ois’s handwritten recipe. She left fresh-baked bread. “I used to joke I didn’t know anybody on the street,” said Ms. MacDonald, a film producer who often clocked 11-hour days at the office. While there was a sense of community before, many of her neighbors barely knew each other before the virus stitched their friendships. “We’ve all helped each other get through this crazy time,” said Ms. MacDonald. “In some respects it’s allowed us to forget a little about all the terrible.” Ms. Ois’s husband hammered together a greenhouse in their backyard that she called “the house Covid built.” She and the del Aguila family plan to grow seedlings for their neighbors’ bursting gardens next spring. “There’s no going back,” said Kara del Aguila, Guillermo’s wife, who considers the street her “precious lifeline.” “We don’t order flowers for delivery anymore,” she said. “We go to our neighbors’ homes and knock on the front door and give them something we made.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized again this week — this time for taking part in a decision to award a no-bid government contract to a charity deeply connected to his family. The country’s ethics commissioner is digging into the affair, marking the third time Mr. Trudeau has been investigated for breaking conflict-of-interest rules since coming to power in 2015. Since a New Jersey hedge fund quietly assumed ownership of Postmedia, Canada’s largest newspaper chain, the company has cut its work force, shuttered papers across Canada, reduced salaries and benefits, and centralized editorial operations in a way that has made parts of its 106 newspapers into clones of one another, my colleague Edmund Lee reports.

"South Korean Lawsuit Filed Against Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s Sister",2020-07-17,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — After North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office on its own soil last month, plunging relations with South Korea to a diplomatic nadir, a conservative activist lawyer in the South decided that one person was responsible: Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. So he filed a lawsuit against Ms. Kim. South Korean prosecutors said on Friday that they were looking into the litigation, but it was not clear whether they would begin a formal investigation. Their hands appeared to be tied: They have practically no way to summon Mr. Kim’s sister to court to face the accusation. The suit is largely symbolic, but if it triggers an angry reaction from the North, it could lead to the further deterioration of the relationship between the two Koreas. The activist lawyer, Lee Kyung-jae, a vocal critic of Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, told reporters last \u200bweek \u200bthat he had been driven to file the lawsuit in part because the government of Mr. Moon had not been aggressive enough in dealing with the North’s destruction of the liaison office. Inter-Korean relations were warmer in 2018, when Mr. Kim held summit meetings with President Moon, who helped arrange meetings between Mr. Kim and President Trump. But ties turned frosty once Mr. Kim’s second meeting with Mr. Trump, held in Vietnam in February 2019, collapsed. Tension mounted between the two Koreas as Ms. Kim became the hard-line face and voice of North Korea. After activists in the South sent anti-North Korean leaflets \u200b over the border into the North, she issued a series of statements threatening retaliation — including the destruction of the liaison office. The North Korean military did blow up the office last month, which is in the border city of Kaesong, North Korea. But her brother later suspended any further military actions aimed at scuttling the relatively warm relationship that had developed between the two Koreas in recent years. Last week, Mr. Lee filed the lawsuit asking prosecutors to indict Ms. Kim, along with Pak Jong-chon, chief of the general staff of the North Korean military, on charges of destroying a building constructed with South Korean taxpayer’s money. A legal complaint in South Korea is generally assigned to a prosecutor to decide whether it merits a full investigation. Prosecutors usually suspend attempts to indict criminal suspects when they cannot be brought to court. Even Mr. Lee acknowledged that there was no way for prosecutors to present Ms. Kim in a court in the South. The lawsuit against Ms. Kim comes on the heels of a landmark ruling this month in a civil suit filed on behalf of two South Korean prisoners of war from the 1950-53 Korean War. With the help of conservative lawyers, the men, who spent decades in the North before escaping to the South, won their case when a Seoul court ordered Kim Jong-un and North Korea to compensate them for the forced labor they suffered while in the North. Under South Korea’s Constitution, North Korea and its people are technically part of South Korea. \u200b And in South Korea, civil lawsuits can be tried without the defendants in court. The ruling in the P.O.W. case ruling was also largely symbolic because there was no way South Korea can force Mr. Kim and North Korea to pay the compensation. \u200bStill, it encouraged politically active conservative lawyers to file or consider other lawsuits against North Korea over a host of issues, such as the widespread abuse of human rights. On Friday, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said it had stripped two refugee groups of their licenses as legal entities because sending leaflets over the border endangered the lives of nearby villagers by raising tensions with North Korea and was not part of what they said they would do when getting the licenses. Without the licenses, the two groups cannot raise funds through donations and other means. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek criminal charges against Ms. Kim. But given past practices, they will most likely drop the case after studying the complaint. In the past, activists had sued top North Korean leaders, like Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, over incidents like the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010. But prosecutors indicted no one.']","The litigation, for the destruction of the inter-Korean liaison office, is largely symbolic because there is no way for prosecutors to bring Ms. Kim to court."
"As Seasonal Rains Fall, Dispute Over Nile Dam Rushes Toward a Reckoning",2020-07-18,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — Every day now, seasonal rain pounds the lush highlands of northern Ethiopia, sending cascades of water into the Blue Nile, the twisting tributary of perhaps Africa’s most fabled river. Farther downstream, the water inches up the concrete wall of a towering, $4.5 billion hydroelectric dam across the Nile, the largest in Africa, now moving closer to completion. A moment that Ethiopians have anticipated eagerly for a decade —\xa0and which Egyptians have come to dread — has finally arrived. Satellite images released this week showed water pouring into the reservoir behind the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam —\xa0which will be nearly twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty. Ethiopia hopes the project will double its electricity production, bolster its economy, and help unify its people at a time of often-violent divisions. #FillTheDam read one popular hashtag on Ethiopian social media this week. Seleshi Bekele, the Ethiopian water minister, rushed to assuage Egyptian anxieties by insisting that the engorging reservoir was the product of natural, entirely predictable seasonal flooding. He said the formal start of filling, when engineers close the dam gates, has not yet occurred. Effectively, that will be the moment when Ethiopia launches its huge project and gains tremendous control over the flow of Nile waters into Egypt. Despite those assurances, downstream in Egypt, which relies on the Nile for 90 percent of its water, the images prompted consternation. For nearly a decade, Egypt has been negotiating with Ethiopia over how the dam should be filled and operated. The latest, last-ditch effort ended inconclusively on Monday, and the satellite photos, combined with news reports from Ethiopia, fueled speculation that the dam’s reservoir had, in fact, begun to fill up. “The question is: What will we do?” the television host Nashat el-Dihi said on Egypt’s privately-owned Ten TV station on Wednesday. “The people are worried, and that worry must have an influence.” Egyptian fears are amplified by the repeated insistence of the prime minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, that his country will close the dam gates by the end of this month, come what may. “If Ethiopia doesn’t fill the dam, it means Ethiopia has agreed to demolish the dam,” Mr. Abiy told lawmakers on July 7. Although the dam’s reservoir will take at least seven years to fill, the start of the process has acquired an intense significance for both countries — a hydrological Rubicon that, if crossed without agreement, could push their dispute in a new and unpredictable direction. At the United Nations last month, Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, reiterated warnings that his country viewed it as an issue of “existential” significance. “Survival is not a question of choice, but an imperative of nature,” he said. Ethiopia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Taye Atske Selassie, retorted that the dispute over the Nile, which flows through at least six countries, was equally important for Ethiopia. In reality, Egypt faces no immediate threat to its water security. Even if Ethiopia proceeds with the fill as planned this month, less than one-tenth of the reservoir will be filled. With ample reserves of water behind Egypt’s own dam on the Nile, at Aswan, there is little risk of parched Egyptian fields or taps in Cairo running dry. But the two countries remain bitterly divided on key issues, rooted in history, pride and money, that in essence amount to a dispute over control of the Nile itself. “This is an important moment,” said William Davison, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. “It raises the prospect of the two downstream countries pulling out of talks, which may increase tensions.” Egypt wants legally binding assurances that, in the event of prolonged drought, Ethiopia will slow or halt the filling of the dam. Cairo also wants a say in Ethiopia’s development of any other dams on the Nile in the future. Ethiopia rejects those demands, which it views as a violation of sovereignty. Egypt must accept that its centuries-old dominance of the Nile has come to an end, they say. Trust is low on all sides. One Egyptian official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive international talks, accused Ethiopia of seeking a deal with such vague commitments and with so many loopholes that he likened it to a block of Swiss cheese. Ethiopian officials shoot back with accusations that Egypt is behaving in a typically highhanded manner, and they point to strong backing from ordinary Ethiopians — many of whom have a financial stake in the project. Like tens of thousands of Ethiopians, Yacob Arsano Atito, a political-science professor at Addis Ababa University in the Ethiopian capital, bought government bonds in the dam years ago. He hopes his investment of $225 will soon be repaid. “I’m very happy the project is on its way to completion,” he said. In an interview, Mr. Bekele, the Ethiopian water minister, said that the dam was not fully constructed. It currently rises to more than 1,800 feet, about 260 feet short of its final height. Not all of its 13 turbines have been installed. Although the dam’s reservoir has a maximum capacity of 19.5 trillion gallons, much larger than the reservoir behind the Hoover Dam, its optimal operating size will be about 13 trillion gallons, the equivalent of one year’s flow of the Nile. In many ways, though, the dispute is as much about politics as hydrology. Mr. Abiy, the Ethiopian premier, swept to power in 2018 with a reputation as a reformer, and last year, he won a Nobel Peace Prize for his success in forging peace with Eritrea. But recently, his country has again become mired in violent upheaval over the status of the Oromo, its largest ethnic group. In the east of the country, the insurgent Oromo Liberation Army carries out attacks on the security forces, and at least 166 people were killed in late June during protests over the killing of Hachalu Hundessa, a popular Oromo musician and activist. For Mr. Ahmed, who has repeatedly vowed to fill the dam this month, the project provides “something that Ethiopians can unite around,” said Mr. Atito, the political scientist. There are also perils for Egypt’s authoritarian leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. His security forces do not anticipate major demonstrations if he fails to strike a deal with Ethiopia, officials said. But after building up the dispute for so many years, Mr. el-Sisi’s legitimacy could take a knock if he fails to act, particularly at a time when he is also facing down threats from other regional rivals. In a meeting with Libyan tribal leaders on Thursday, Mr. el-Sisi reiterated a threat to send Egyptian troops into Libya to fend off forces backed by his rival, Turkey. Stuck in the middle is Sudan, which lies between Ethiopia and Egypt. Sudan stands to benefit from cheaper electricity produced by the dam, but worries that any sudden release of water could damage its own, smaller Roseires Dam. Western diplomats observing the crisis say that veiled Egyptian threats of military action against Ethiopia are unlikely to be carried through, although Egyptian officials refuse to rule it out. But for now, the focus is on a political deal. The African Union, headed by South Africa, is expected to call an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis next week. Mediators hope that, with one final push, they can bridge the differences between Ethiopia and Egypt, before seasonal rains fill the gap for them.

Tunisian Woman Sentenced to Prison Over Joke Alluding to the Quran,2020-07-17,By Lilia Blaise and Elian Peltier,"['TUNIS — As Tunisia battled the coronavirus pandemic in May, and millions in the North African country found themselves confined to their homes, a lighthearted Facebook post about the virus caught Emna Chargui’s eye and brought a brief moment of laughter in a period of uncertainty. The “Sourate Corona,” a design that appears to have been created in France, delivered a simple “wash your hands” message framed in recognizable green contours and adorned with virus symbols, mimicking the style of Quranic verse. Ms. Chargui, 27, shared the post. But what was meant as a simple quip about the outbreak has become a fight for Ms. Chargui’s freedom of expression that could result in a prison sentence. This week, Ms. Chargui was found guilty of “inciting hatred between religions,” and sentenced to six months in jail and a $700 fine for the post, in a case that has raised questions about the extent to which freedom of speech is protected in the country. Hundreds have now shared the same image along with the hashtag #FreeEmnaChargui in solidarity with the young woman. Ms. Chargui’s case has drawn little attention in the country, aside from rights groups calling for her release: The coronavirus pandemic dominates the news cycle, along with the abrupt resignation on Wednesday of the prime minister, Elyes Fakhfakh, just months after he was sworn into office. But rights organizations have warned that the ruling against Ms. Chargui could set a dangerous precedent in a country that has been hailed as a rare example of democratic success since the Arab Spring in 2011, but where discussions of religion  remain taboo. Ahmed Benchemsi, the communications director for Human Rights Watch in the Middle East and North Africa, called the ruling a “setback for freedom of expression in a country that has otherwise made great strides on the path to democracy.” Tunisia, which enforced a nationwide lockdown and closed its borders in mid-March, has fared better than some of its neighbors in containing the spread of the coronavirus, with 50 deaths and 1,326 confirmed cases as of Friday. Ms. Chargui said she had received hundreds of death threats and threats of sexual violence since she first shared the image. “I thought it was a good way to make people aware about washing their hands and be careful with the coronavirus, with a style that everyone knows,” she said in a telephone interview on Wednesday after her sentencing, which her lawyers have appealed. “I did not even think about how big this would get when I shared it,” she added. Ms. Chargui, who said she considers herself an atheist, has since deleted the initial post but maintains that she is within her rights to express her personal beliefs. “My mother wears the veil, she is Muslim, and she supports me,” she said. “I want to be able to live in my country and show that you can be a non-Muslim as well.” Ms. Chargui’s appeal is likely to be heard by a court in September or October, and she remains free until then. Tunisia has been praised for a successful democratic transition, despite some political instability, after the Arab Spring uprising that gripped the nation and ultimately toppled the longtime autocratic president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Last year, the country of nearly 12 million people completed its second set of free presidential elections since the revolution. Since the transition to a democratic system, state prosecutors have pursued some individuals for “harming religion” in 2011 and 2012, including two atheists who were sentenced to seven years of jail time for sharing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. (The two were granted presidential pardons two years later.) But such cases have dwindled after a new Constitution was introduced in 2014 that provides protection of religious freedom and freedom of speech, among other personal liberties. Yet for some, Ms. Chargui crossed a red line in sharing an image mimicking the sacred text, according to Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Tunis-based deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. “Some of the comments on Facebook show that what she did is still taboo, even for ‘progressive’ people,” said Ms. Guellali, who said the decision was disproportionate to the perceived offense. For now, as Ms. Chargui waits for a ruling on her appeal, her life is filled with uncertainty. Her landlord, she said, had ordered her family to leave the house they have been renting in Tunis for 10 years, “because he wants nothing to do with us.” Lilia Blaise reported from Tunis and Elian Peltier from London.']","Emna Chargui, 27, said she didn’t want to offend anyone when she shared another Facebook user’s post about the coronavirus that mimicked Quranic iconography."
3 Dead After Glacier Tour Bus Rolls Over in Canadian Rockies,2020-07-19,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — A popular tourist outing in the Rocky Mountains in Alberta turned into a scene of chaos after a glacier tour bus rolled on Saturday afternoon, killing three passengers and injuring 24 others on board, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Cpl. Leigh Drinkwater of the mounted police said that the driver of the specially designed ice bus was among the survivors, although he had no knowledge of that person’s condition. Alberta health services said that 14 people had been taken to hospitals in “critical, life-threatening condition.” The bus, which has oversize tires for driving on ice and similarly oversize sightseeing windows, was climbing a rocky, steep road to the Columbia Icefields in Jasper National Park when it plunged down an embankment, Corporal Drinkwater said. A photograph from a bystander posted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation showed the red and white bus badly damaged and resting on its roof on rocky moraine. It was not immediately known why the bus toppled over. Emergency workers from a variety of agencies descended on the ice field shortly after the accident. At least one helicopter contracted out by Parks Canada, the federal parks agency, was used to lift the dead and injured from the crash site to five air ambulances up on the ice field or road ambulances down below on a nearby parkway. The injured tourists were being treated in three nearby cities. Tanya Otis, a spokeswoman for Pursuit, the company that operates tours of the ice fields, said the incident involved one of its special, all-terrain buses that allow visitors to walk on the glacier. The ice fields are a major international tourist attraction and are part of the Athabasca Glacier, one of the largest in the Rockies, and it feeds three major water systems in Western Canada. While Parks Canada has said that the ice field has been melting for about 125 years, climate change has accelerated that process. One witness said on Twitter that he was stuck with several other passenger on another “ice explorer” bus that was forced to stop after the incident The man wrote that he saw the other bus lose “control and roll over.” Rob Kanty, who witnessed the rollover after finishing an earlier bus tour, said in an email that it appeared the bus had encountered a rock slide, although he said it was uncertain what role that had played in the crash. He added that the buses did not have seatbelts. Corporal Drinkwater said that investigators had ruled out any criminal intent in the crash.']","The vehicle, with 27 people on board, was specially designed to carry visitors onto one of North America’s largest glaciers, in Jasper National Park in Alberta."
Long Waits for U.K. Hospital Treatment as N.H.S. Fights Coronavirus,2020-07-18,By Ceylan Yeginsu,"['LONDON — After nine months of waiting for surgery, Ruth Fawcett’s knee muscles wasted away, causing her joint to come loose in its socket and leaving her unable to walk without assistance. “They’ve just stopped doing surgery for cases that they call nonlife-threatening and when they start again, they will probably have to prioritize the most urgent cases,” she said, taking a deep sigh. Ms. Fawcett, 82, a jewelry designer from the northwestern county of Cumbria, is one of nearly four million people in England on the National Health Service waiting list for routine hospital treatments, which have been disrupted in recent months as hospitals have been forced to suspend services in favor of coronavirus cases. Many patients like Ms. Fawcett are experiencing a significant deterioration in their health because of the delay and are growing anxious and frustrated because of the lack of guidance as to where they are placed on the list, or how long they will have to wait before they can receive treatment. Many fear that they could be pushed down the list if hospitals resume services on a triage basis. “They won’t tell me where I am on the list, or how urgent they consider my case to be,” Ms. Fawcett continued. “I can hardly walk. My knee just wobbles about and if I don’t use my two walking sticks, I will fall. It’s very scary.” Even before the pandemic, the service was struggling to meet waiting time standards with one in six patients waiting more than the target of 18 weeks for routine treatment in January. The number of people on the waiting list for elective care fell from 3.94 million in April to 3.84 million in May, according to N.H.S. figures published on Thursday. However, the drop has been attributed to fewer people being referred for testing and treatment during the pandemic — numbers are expected to start climbing again when services resume. With hospitals operating at reduced capacity to accommodate patients suffering from Covid-19, the waiting list could soar to 10 million people by the end of the year, according to the N.H.S. Confederation, which represents hospitals and other health care providers. “There is a real determination to rise to this challenge, but it will need extra funding and capacity, not least in rehabilitation and recovery services in the community where so much of the coming demand will be felt,” said Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the confederation. The N.H.S. rejects the confederation’s estimate, saying that waiting lists for both diagnostic tests and elective care have fallen since February. “The overall waiting list has fallen by more than half a million since the onset of Covid, but as more patients come forward local health services continue work to expand services safely,” an N.H.S. spokesperson said. “Despite responding rapidly to the coronavirus pandemic and the need to ensure over 100,000 patients could receive hospital care, N.H.S. staff also provided more than five million urgent tests, checks and treatment in a safe way during the peak of the virus.” Experts say there is a growing crisis in the provision of diagnostic tests, including magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography scans. “The total number of patients waiting six weeks or more from referral for one of the 15 key tests is at almost 571,500 — 58.5 percent of the total number of patients waiting — which is shocking given the target is 1 percent,” said Dr. Nick Scriven, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine. Cancer patients have been hit particularly hard. About 2.4 million people were waiting for cancer treatment or tests in June, according to the charity Cancer Research U.K., and thousands of people have missed out on hospital referrals for the diagnostic tests that are critical in the early detection and successful treatment of cancer. Even after patients were referred to a specialist, the median length of time they waited for treatment in April was 12.2 weeks, the longest time in more than a decade. More than one million patients waited more than 18 weeks, N.H.S. England figures show. Sylvia Traynor has cervical cancer and was undergoing a six-month regimen of chemo and radiation therapy when her doctor called in late April to tell her that her treatment had been paused for seven weeks because of the risks posed by the coronavirus. “Just like that, they said don’t come in,” she recalled. “I couldn’t believe that they could just pull the plug like that. I know they have higher-priority cases to deal with, but my treatment was actually working and all I could think was, ‘What if this goes on for the rest of the year and I regress? What if all this treatment was for nothing?’” The uncertainty and anxiety caused by the backlog has been taking a toll on mental health. Many patients waiting for surgery complain about having to deal with excruciating pain on a daily basis, and many of them are reluctant to take strong opioid painkillers prescribed by doctors because of the side effects and addictive properties. “I may not be young, but my brain is very active and sometimes I just get so down because I’m in so much pain and I can’t do anything,” Ms. Fawcett said. “I feel trapped.” Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Ms. Fawcett signed the consent for her surgery in October and has still not been given an appointment date for the preliminary medical examination to determine whether she is fit for the operation. “So many older people on the waiting list have seen their health decline during this time and are finding that they are losing their mobility further because they have not been able to move much during lockdown,” said Jane Mindar, the deputy chief executive officer for the charity Age UK in West Cumbria. “They may not be in good enough health by the time they receive an appointment for their operation and that, combined with loneliness, anxiety and depression, is quite a big thing for one person to tackle,” she said. Many younger people and families are also being affected by the delays. Melis Kip, 31, a client manager at a retail consultancy firm in London, has been waiting more than six months to see a dermatologist for her 1-year-old son, who has an acute form of eczema. “Our doctor says this is not serious, it is OK to wait, and we will treat him in the meantime, but the treatment is not working,” Ms. Kip said. “He gets these terrible flare-ups where his skin becomes all itchy and red and he is very uncomfortable. It’s worrying.” Ms. Kip has also been struggling with her own health issues. She has been unable to get a referral to her local women’s clinic for a contraceptive fitting because it is not considered urgent. “Women’s health is a big issue, but most matters are dismissed because they are not seen as life-threatening,” Ms. Kip said. “But when the whole health system is on hold for non-urgent treatment, that can lead to other problems. For example, women can suffer from mental health issues because of hormonal imbalances.” Now that borders have reopened, Ms. Kip, who is Turkish, plans to travel to Turkey with her son for treatment. “We can’t afford to wait any longer and are in the fortunate position to be able to travel and receive good care at an affordable price,” she said. In England, some people have resorted to private clinics for diagnostic care, but many of them say they are unable to afford surgery or treatment once they have received a diagnosis. Emma Shearer, a 36-year-old real estate broker, has endometriosis, a debilitating hormonal disease that on some days causes such great pelvic pain that she is unable to get out of bed. After waiting three months for a referral, Ms. Shearer went to a private hospital for testing. “First you pay over 200 pounds for a 30-minute consultation,” she said — about $250 — “and then you are paying thousands for tests, only to realize you can’t afford the surgery and need to get back on the N.H.S. and wait,” she said. “The coronavirus is leaving so many of us with no choice but to neglect our health,” she added. “It’s terrifying and it’s not going to end well.”']","With routine operations in England curtailed, some patients have experienced a significant deterioration."
"Despite Masks’ Proven Value, Some U.S. Leaders Avoid Mandates",2020-07-19,,"['[Follow our live Covid-19 news and updates.] As caseloads surge in many states, especially in the West and South, the debate over mask mandates continues, though evidence of their benefits has mounted substantially in recent months. President Trump, who first wore a mask in public on July 11, said in a Fox News interview with Chris Wallace broadcast on Sunday that he was a “believer” in masks, but that he would not support a nationwide mask mandate: “I leave it up to the governors.” The consistent message from the White House that virus restrictions be made at the local level has led to a patchwork of policies. More than half the states have issued mask requirements, but with many Americans feeling that mask orders impinge on individual freedom, some governors are holding out. The issue dominated talk shows on Sunday. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes for Health, called the politicization of face coverings “bizarre” in an interview on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” “Our best chance is for all of us to get together and do the right thing, and stop fighting so much about the divide between different political perspectives, which is just getting in the way,” Dr. Collins said. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado defended his decision to issue a statewide mask mandate that took effect Friday. New cases have been rising for a month, nearing the tallies during the peak of Colorado’s crisis in April, though deaths remain far lower. Mr. Polis, a Democrat, said on the ABC program “This Week” that it “was a really easy decision” after he saw data suggesting that local mask orders in his state were tied to lower case numbers. Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi said that he would not issue a statewide mask order, even though cases and hospitalizations were soaring. “If I believed that was the best way to save lives in my state, I would have done it a long time ago,” Mr. Reeves, a Republican, said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” He said he preferred a “surgical approach,” with precautions varying county by county. In Georgia, the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has sued the Democratic mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, over virus policies in Atlanta that include a mask order. On the CBS program “Face the Nation,” she called the lawsuit “a blame game.” On the ABC program “This Week,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican, said he would not support a national mandate, though he issued a state ordinance on Thursday. He said he had waited because a mask mandate was “not popular” in his state. Arkansas has been averaging more than 660 cases daily, which is near the state’s peak level, according to a New York Times database. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, said on “Meet the Press” that his state was heading in the “wrong direction” and that he would not rule out a mask order. While single-day tallies for new cases in Ohio averaged around 400 a month ago, they peaked on Friday, with 1,679 cases. Representative Donna E. Shalala of Florida, a Democrat who was formerly the nation’s longest-serving Secretary of Health and Human Services, called on her state’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, to issue mask and stay-at-home orders. State health officials on Sunday reported more than 10,000 new cases for the fifth consecutive day. “We need to close down in Florida,” Ms. Shalala said on “This Week.” “We’ve asked the governor to do that. We’ve even asked him to do the simplest thing: That is to require masks for everyone.” Despairing over President Trump’s failure to contain the pandemic and his refusal to promote clear public-health guidelines, prominent figures in the Republican Party have broken with the White House in recent days on how to respond to the virus. Some, concluding that the president may never play a constructive role in addressing the crisis, have decided that they must work around him, ignoring or even contradicting his pronouncements. Republican leaders have split with Mr. Trump over issues like the value of wearing a mask in public and of heeding the advice of health experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, whom the president and some aides have subjected to caustic personal criticism. They appear to be spurred by several overlapping forces, including deteriorating conditions in their states, the president’s seeming indifference to the problem, and the approach of a presidential election in which Mr. Trump is badly lagging his presumed Democratic challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the polls. Republican governors are now issuing orders that run counter to Mr. Trump’s demands. Some have been holding late-night phone calls among themselves to trade ideas and grievances; they have sought out partners in the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, who, despite echoing Mr. Trump in public, is seen by governors as being far more attentive to the disaster. “The president got bored with it,” David Carney, an adviser to the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican, said of the pandemic. His boss instead directs his requests to Mr. Pence, with whom he speaks two to three times a week, Mr. Carney said. When European health ministers met in February to discuss the novel coronavirus emerging in China, they commended their own health systems and promised to send aid to poor and developing countries. Barely a month later, the continent was overwhelmed. Officials once boastful about their preparedness were frantically trying to secure protective gear and materials for tests, as death rates soared in Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. This was not supposed to happen. Many European leaders felt so secure after the last pandemic — the 2009 swine flu — that they scaled back stockpiles of equipment and faulted medical experts for overreacting. But their pandemic plans were built on a litany of miscalculations. Though European leaders boasted of the superiority of their world-class health systems, they had weakened them with a decade of cutbacks. When Covid-19 arrived, those systems were unable to test widely enough to see the peak coming. National stockpiles of medical supplies were revealed to exist mostly on paper, consisting in large part of “just in time” contracts with manufacturers in China. European planners overlooked the fact that a pandemic could disrupt those supply chains. Britain most embodies Europe’s overconfidence. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was so certain of his country’s forecasts about the virus, records and testimony show, that he delayed locking down until two weeks after British emergency rooms began to buckle under the strain. With the number of infections doubling every three days at the time, some scientists now say that locking down a week sooner might have saved 30,000 lives. Global roundup Government health workers sent out to care for Indigenous people in Brazil appear to have been spreading the virus among them instead. More than 1,000 nurses and doctors with a health service known as Sesai, have tested positive for the virus as of early July. In at least six field offices, The New York Times found, the share of infected workers was above the Amazon region’s average of 8 percent. The health workers were dispatched with neither adequate protective equipment nor access to enough tests. Their high infection rates suggests that “there were failures in the protection of health care workers at a critical moment, affecting teams that care for a highly vulnerable population,” said Felipe Tavares of  the Federal Fluminense University. More than 15,500 Indigenous Brazilians have been confirmed infected, including at least 10,889 living in protected territories, according to Instituto Socioambiental, a Brazilian nonprofit. It is not possible to determine with certainty how many cases were introduced by health care workers. Some Indigenous people may have brought the virus into their communities after traveling to cities for supplies and emergency government aid. Illegal miners and loggers may also have exposed some communities. In a statement, Sesai said reports that health workers had exposed Indigenous people to the virus were “inconclusive.” It said its employees were outfitted with protective equipment. “All this planning and early research led to timely and efficient care that was delivered in villages,” the statement said. Several Sesai workers who spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation, described an exceptionally challenging mission marked by poor guidance, mistrust from many Indigenous communities and a scarcity of tests. Enoque Taurepang, the coordinator of the Indigenous Council of Roraima, said doctors and nurses had been set up for failure. “You can’t blame health professionals, because they didn’t have the tools necessary to act,” he said. The leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, said Sunday that the city had recorded more than 100 new cases in the past 24 hours, the most since the pandemic took hold in late January. “The situation is very serious and there is no sign of it coming under control,” Ms. Lam said. Hong Kong suspended nonessential government services and told most civil servants to work from home from this week. Turkey has suspended flights to Iran and Afghanistan in response to infections in those countries, its Transport Ministry said. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Saturday that some 25 million Iranians may have been infected, and Iran reimposed restrictions in the capital and elsewhere. The figure, from a report Mr. Rouhani cited in a televised speech, was far higher than Saturday’s official figure for infections of 271,606. Face coverings will be required in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, whenever people leave home, officials there said on Sunday, citing a recent increase in cases. The requirement will take effect on Wednesday. Violations could result in a fine of 200 Australian dollars, or roughly $140. Chinese officials are battling a growing outbreak in the far western Xinjiang region, the center of the country’s broad crackdown on predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. Thirty confirmed infections have been reported in its capital, Urumqi, since Thursday, 13 of them on Sunday; there are an additional 41 asymptomatic infections.  European Union leaders held a third day of acrimonious negotiations on Sunday, but there was no sign that a deal was imminent on a stimulus package involving more than 750 billion euros, or $840 billion. Most E.U. countries are keen to see the plan move ahead, but some, mostly from the wealthier northern part of Europe, are loath to allow the money to make up for what they see as southern Europeans’ failure to adequately protect their economies. With English hospitals operating at pandemic-reduced capacity, nearly four million people are on the National Health Service waiting list for routine hospital treatments that have been disrupted as hospitals have been forced to suspend services in favor of treating coronavirus cases. The waiting list could soar to 10 million people by the end of the year, according to the N.H.S. Confederation, which represents hospitals and other health care providers, though the service rejects that estimate. The Bahamas, one of the places where Americans could still travel, will now bar commercial flights or vessels from the United States, the country’s prime minister announced on Sunday. The government-owned airline, Bahamasair, will also cease flights to the U.S. “effective immediately,” said the prime minister, Hubert Minnis. The ban does not include commercial flights to Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, or “private international flights,” he said. Despite claiming to have no cases of Covid-19, North Korea says its scientists are developing a vaccine for the virus. In claims that cannot be verified, a propaganda website said that the vaccine’s safety had been verified through animal experiments and that it had entered a clinical trial. The reclusive nation’s public health system remains woefully underequipped, and international relief agencies have been providing test kits and other assistance to help the country fight the spread of the coronavirus. As demand for coronavirus testing surges around the nation, laboratories that process samples have backlogs that have left anxious patients waiting days — and sometimes a week or more — for their results. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, acknowledged the dangers associated with such delays in an interview on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” “The average test delay is too long,” Dr. Collins said. “That really undercuts the value of the testing, because you do the testing to find out who’s carrying the virus, and then quickly get them isolated so they don’t spread it around. And it’s very hard to make that work when there’s a long delay built in.” On the CBS program “Face the Nation,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said that “once testing is delayed more than 48 hours, it becomes not very useful.” The longer it takes for people to determine whether they’ve been infected, Dr. Gottlieb said, the more difficult it will be to curb the spread of disease and drive new-case numbers down. To speed turnaround times, Dr. Collins said, health officials are pushing for more point-of-care testing — “on the spot” assays designed to be done rapidly and easily without the need for specialized laboratory equipment or highly trained personnel. Some of these tests could be completed in a doctor’s office, or perhaps even at home, in less than an hour. Simple, speedy tests could be a boon for institutions and communities that care for large numbers of vulnerable people, like nursing homes. A handful of point-of-care tests have been approved for emergency use by the F.D.A. “We need to invest a lot of money, and the government is willing to do so, in scaling those up,” Dr. Collins said. “That’s the kind of thing that I personally, along with many others in other parts of the government, are working on night and day to try to do a better job of.” As companies across China rush to produce personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, a New York Times visual investigation has found that some of them are using Uighur labor through a contentious government-sponsored program that experts say often puts people to work against their will. Uighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the Xinjiang region of northwest China. The government promotes the labor transfer program, which sends Uighurs and other ethnic minorities into factory and service jobs, as a way to reduce poverty, but quotas on the number of workers put into the labor program and the penalties faced by those who refuse to cooperate mean that participation is often coerced. Now, that labor is part of the P.P.E. supply chain. According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51. After reviewing state media reports and public records, The Times found that at least 17 of those companies participate in the labor transfer program. The companies produce equipment primarily for domestic use, but The Times identified several other companies outside Xinjiang that use Uighur labor and export globally. We traced a shipment of face masks to a medical supply company in the U.S. state of Georgia from a factory in China’s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers had been sent. The workers are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their loyalty to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies. Watch the full visual investigation in the video above. U.S. ROUNDUP Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said that the coronavirus was spreading in the city to the point where a new stay-at-home order would have to be issued. “We’re on the brink of that,” he said on the CNN program “State of the Union” on Sunday. He declined to be more specific about the timing or scope of a new order, except to say, “We have to be surgical, rather than a cleaver that would just shut everything down.” He said he agreed that earlier restrictions had been relaxed too quickly. “Mayors often have no control over what reopens up and doesn’t,” he said. “That’s either at a state or county level.” But he added, “It’s not just about what’s open and closed, but it’s also about what we do individually.” Los Angeles County has recorded more than 153,000 cases so far, and the spread of the virus has been quickening across Southern California. “Cases have gone up, but we also have the most aggressive testing,” the mayor. “We were the first city to offer tests to people without symptoms.” In other news around the country: Congressional leaders are puzzling over how to safely and appropriately honor Representative John Lewis of Georgia, an icon of the civil rights movement who died on Friday. Congress has honored more than 40 people by allowing their remains to lie in state under the Capitol dome, and many believe that such an honor would be fitting for Mr. Lewis. But the Capitol is closed to tourists and those allowed inside are encouraged to stay six feet apart. The Defense Department sent Navy teams to help support four medical centers in South and Southwest Texas as the virus surges there, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas announced on Sunday. The teams were dispatched to Harlingen, Del Rio, Eagle Pass and Rio Grande City. The state has recorded 71,779 new cases in the last week, bringing its total case load to over 330,000, with nearly 4,000 deaths. Officials in Louisiana reported 3,116 new cases on Sunday, exceeding the previous single-day record of 2,728 new cases, which were reported on April 2. The state did not provide any update on Saturday, which is a likely explanation for Sunday’s spike. Despite the N.F.L. having outlined return dates for in-person training in a memo sent to teams last Friday, the N.F.L. Players Association still has not agreed with the league on key safety issues, prompting some of football’s biggest names to voice their concerns on social media. “If the NFL doesn’t do their part to keep players healthy there is no football in 2020,” Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “It’s that simple. Get it done.” The Canadian government said it would not allow the Toronto Blue Jays to stage home games. The team had hoped to play at Rogers Centre beginning on July 29, as part of Major League Baseball’s plan to use all 30 of its teams’ ballparks for a shortened 60-game season, with a number of precautions including having no fans in the stands. But on Saturday, Canada’s immigration minister said repeated cross-border travel by players and staff members posed a health risk. The team will play its regular-season home games in the United States instead, most likely at its AAA minor-league affiliate’s stadium in Buffalo. As the virus spreads out across the United States, it is bearing down on places that are most vulnerable to its devastation — among them the southernmost wedge of Texas, on the border with Mexico, which is experiencing a punishing surge in infection. In the Rio Grande Valley, more than a third of families live in poverty. Up to half of residents have no health insurance. More than 60 percent are diabetic or prediabetic. The rates of obesity and heart disease are among the nation’s highest. And more than 90 percent of the population is Latino, a group that is dying from the virus at higher rates than white Americans are. “We knew that this was a time bomb,” said Dr. Adolfo Kaplan, a local critical care physician. But in the early days of the pandemic, there were few infections in the valley. Many public health officials attributed that to lockdown orders. Then in May, Gov. Greg Abbott let them expire. “We knew that if the hospital was hit, it was going to be a disaster,” said Dr. Kaplan, who works at DHR Health in Edinburg, Texas. “And that’s what we are living through.” The three facilities the hospital is using to treat patients with Covid-19 have been filled to capacity since the first week of July. At times, a dozen or more ambulances have waited outside for beds to become available. With 10,000 active infections in the region, public health officers estimate that hospitalizations could double within two weeks. “Our curve is a straight up trajectory right now,” said Sherri Abendroth, the hospital’s safety and emergency management coordinator. “There’s no flattening. There’s no relief.” Coronavirus cases in Tennessee have been rising sharply since late June, especially in and around Memphis and Nashville, where county officials are reporting hundreds of new cases a day. Both cities have been trying to tamp down outbreaks by reintroducing some restrictions, but they have run into resistance from restaurant and bar owners in the bustling nightlife districts. Across the country, crowded night spots have been cited as especially problematic settings in a pandemic, where masks just get in the way and social distancing is the opposite of what the patrons are there for. But owners have bridled at being singled out for shutdowns. In Davidson County, which includes Nashville, four bars sued the city after  bars were ordered to close through the end of July, while restaurants were allowed to stay open at 50 percent capacity.  Nashville’s mayor, John Cooper, acknowledged  that the city’s restrictions would be difficult to enforce “in a population that probably does include disease deniers.” And he said there was only so much Nashville could do when surrounding counties had much laxer restrictions. In Shelby County, which includes Memphis, bars and “limited service” restaurants were ordered to close earlier this month while others were allowed to stay open. That sparked a fight with owners who say the “limited service” distinction — applied to establishments that get less than 50 percent of their revenue from food — is arbitrary and pointless. A hearing in the case is set for Monday. The plaintiffs say the closure rule simply pushes patrons from some restaurants to others without any appreciable public health benefit. The lead plaintiff, Jeannette Comans, who owns the Blind Bear cocktail bar, said she had just rehired and trained enough employees to be almost fully staffed — including adding people at the door to check patrons’ temperatures and remind them about mask rules — when the new closure order was issued.  “They left me with no choice” but to sue, she said of health officials. “I still have to pay rent, I still have to pay business insurance. My poor employees daily are like, ‘What do we do?’ And I’m like, ‘I don’t know.’” President Trump called Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, an “alarmist” who provided faulty information in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. His remarks, in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, were the latest public criticism from a White House that appears to be mounting a coordinated effort to discredit Dr. Fauci, on the record and off, and in presidential tweets. Administration officials deny doing so. “I don’t know that he’s a leaker,” Mr. Trump said during the interview with Chris Wallace “He’s a little bit of an alarmist. That’s OK. A little bit of an alarmist.” Mr. Trump said that Dr. Fauci had been against his decision to close the borders to travelers from China in January. That is not true: While Dr. Fauci was initially opposed to the idea on the grounds that a ban would prevent medical professionals from traveling to hard-hit areas, he supported the decision by the time it was made. Mr. Trump also said that Dr. Fauci had been against Americans wearing masks. Dr. Fauci has said that he does not regret urging Americans not to wear masks in the early days of the pandemic, referencing a severe shortage of protective gear for medical professionals. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, was asked on the NBC program “Meet the Press” whether anyone at the White House had asked him to demote or fire Dr. Fauci, whose agency is under Dr. Collins’s supervision. “Nobody has asked me to do that and I find that concept unimaginable,” Dr. Collins said. In the hourlong interview on Fox, Mr. Trump, whose administration made crucial missteps in handling the virus earlier this year, made several false claims on the government’s response to the pandemic. Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the coronavirus rate in other countries was lower than in the United States because those nations did not engage in testing. When Mr. Wallace pointed out the lower case rate across the European Union, the president replied, “It’s possible that they don’t test.” When Mr. Wallace pointed out the increasing death rate in the United States, Mr. Trump replied, “It’s all too much. It shouldn’t be one case. It came from China. They should have never let it escape.” Mr. Trump said that he doubted whether Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., was correct in predicting that the pandemic would be worse this fall. “I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. “And I don’t think he knows.” He said that public health experts and the World Health Organization “got a lot wrong” in the early days of the pandemic, including a theory that the virus would abate as the weather warmed, and then reiterated his earlier claim, unsupported by science, that the virus would suddenly cease one day. “It’s going to disappear and I’ll be right,” Mr. Trump said. “Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else.” Mr. Trump threatened to pull federal funding from schools if they did not open soon. When Mr. Wallace pointed out that only a small portion of funding from the federal government goes to schools — and is mostly used to support disadvantaged and disabled children — the president replied, “Let the schools open.” Mr. Biden, who has been critical of Mr. Trump’s handling of the outbreak, said in a statement on Sunday: “In the middle of a pandemic that continues to worsen on his watch, President Trump is trying to keep money away from the public health measures that we know will keep us and our families safe. He even went on to attack the value of testing again in the same interview, perpetuating a terrible monthslong streak.” “Mr. President, your ignorance isn’t a virtue or a sign of your strength,” Mr. Biden said. “It’s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it’s costing Americans their jobs and their lives.” We’re all spending more time outdoors. Here’s a few tips to take your tired backyard, stoop or balcony into a true escape.

‘Our Role Is to Reduce Their Grief’,2020-07-18,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['THE DESERT WEST OF NAJAF — There are no signs to signal the way to the New Valley of Peace, or, as the Iraqis call it, the “Corona cemetery.” But it’s not hard to find: Just follow the cars. It’s the only place they are headed on the rough desert road. Ground was broken on this cemetery in southern Iraq four months ago, and already there are more than 3,200 graves. The backhoes work every night to make new furrows in the sandy soil. “We are waiting for our mother,” said Ali Radhi, 49, from Nasiriya as he stood by his car at the cemetery’s gate in the blazing summer sun earlier this month, when midafternoon temperatures hit 115 degrees. “She died two days ago, but now with corona, we cannot bring her. We have to wait for the ambulance to carry her.” “There are some rituals we should be doing, but with corona we cannot even touch her body and we did not hold a funeral,” he added softly, staring up the road as if willing the ambulance carrying his mother’s body to appear on the horizon. In Islam, burial should be done quickly, if possible within 24 hours of death. The body should be ritually cleansed by professional washers, but the family can be present — men at the washing of a male relative, women of a female one. In pre-Covid times, Shiite Muslims, no matter where they were from in Iraq, would then carry the coffin on their shoulders around the Imam Ali shrine in the pilgrim city of Najaf and pray over the body outside the shrine’s doors. Then they would take the coffin to the Wadi-Al-Salam cemetery, one of the largest and oldest in the world, for burial. Sunnis would hold their funerals close to home and then take the body to a nearby graveyard, where, as in Shiism, the grave diggers would lift the deceased’s white-shrouded body from the coffin and lay it in the earth, with the head facing Mecca. For Mr. Radhi and the other people whose loved ones have been buried at the new Wadi-Al-Salam cemetery, all these essential rituals must be forgone, and it feels like a betrayal. They failed to do the last good thing possible for someone they loved: to send them in good order to the next world. “They are burying their relative not in the usual way, and this makes them very sad,” said Tawfik Mahdi, a cleric from Najaf, who is on hand to try to comfort families. “Our role is to reduce their grief and say, ‘Don’t worry, this pandemic happened and you cannot be close to them like you were before, but we will pray for you.’” The story of how the cemetery came into existence starts when the first coronavirus patients began to die in March in Baghdad. The religious and health authorities were unprepared for the sense of stigma that having the disease carried, as well as the fear that touching the body would risk contagion. Cemeteries refused to take those who had died of Covid-19 because people whose relatives had not died of the virus felt it was a stigma to be buried next to someone who had. While scientists have not established how long the virus survives in a person who has died of it, they believe it might linger for as much as a few hours and could be on materials used in wrapping and transporting bodies. “I began to see these scenes on TV — I still remember them — there were seven or eight bodies thrown outside a hospital morgue and they left them there,” recalled Sheikh Tahir Al-Khaqani, who is head of the Imam Ali Combat Division, one of the first militias created to fight the Islamic State. Unlike some of the militias that are close to Iran, the Imam Ali brigade is linked to the moderate, inclusive senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The idea came to Mr. Al-Khaqani that the solution was a new graveyard just for those who died of the coronavirus. He conferred with the governor of Najaf, with Mr. Sistani and with the leader of the Shia Endowment, which is in charge of all Shiite financial and real estate matters. Within days, they had a 1,500-acre patch of ground 20 miles from the city of Najaf, allocated for the burials. The Imam Ali combat division volunteered to run the cemetery. Its medical teams took on the job of receiving the dead, disinfecting the body bags in which they arrived and then washing the deceased. Other contingents took responsibility for the digging and burials. Some took on the role of guides to help family members when they come to find their relative’s grave among the thousands stretching out across the desert. Family visits are permitted 10 days after burial. Under orders from the grand ayatollah, although the graveyard is run by Shiites, it welcomes everyone regardless of faith or sect and burial is free. Mohammed Qasim, a date and vegetable farmer from near Baghdad, said those digging the graves, attending to the washing and pronouncing the last rites are “human angels.” “Yes, these are the noblest people I have ever met,” he said. “How can they not be the noblest when they are with death at the same table for breakfast, lunch and dinner and yet they do not complain.” For Ari Sahak Dirthal, 33, an Armenian Christian, his father’s burial on July 1 is still a source of pain. “I immediately went to the Armenian Orthodox church in Baghdad because I knew that my father wanted to be buried there, and so I was surprised when they said we cannot bury him here,” he said. They directed him to the coronavirus cemetery. On the way, he frantically made calls to find out what prayers to say. It still cuts to the quick, he said, that no one from the Armenian Orthodox Church came with him. Mr. Dirthal said he was welcomed by the sheikhs in charge of the cemetery, who told him his father could be buried anywhere. “I just said, ‘I want the grave of my father to be away from the others,’ and indeed he was buried one kilometer away from the graves of the Muslims,” Mr. Dirthal said. The Shiite grave diggers did their best for his father, he said, sending him a video of the burial, with one of the Shiite medical staff wearing protective gear and awkwardly making the sign of the cross over his father’s body. For Sunnis, the rituals are more familiar, and so the farewells have been easier — and less lonely. Hundreds of Sunnis are buried here. But a burial far from home is still hard. The main Sunni cemetery in Baghdad would not accept the body of the father of Al-Murtada Ahmed Jasmin, even though that is where all his family members had been buried. “All the way driving to the new Wadi Al-Salam cemetery, I spoke with my father and said to him, ‘Please forgive me I could not do your will and bury you with our family,’” said Mr. Jasmin, 22. But after he arrived at the cemetery, “all of the tiredness and anger went away because I found a typical cemetery where I could visit my father at any time,” he said. “I felt great relief and said to myself that God loves my father when he chose this place for his burial.” The cemetery entrance is nothing more than a metal skeleton frame in the shape of a grand mosque door. Beyond stretches the desert, glittering in the sun, with row after row after row of graves, each with the words of the Quran: “This is the will of Allah.” As the sun set on the evening earlier this month, more families arrived along with the ambulances. Burials take place from 6 p.m. until the first prayers of the morning. Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters stood at the edge of the cemetery. A rope kept them from entering to ensure that they stay far from the bodies and any live infection. Some raised their arms to the sky and cried their loss. Although the weeping and keening are ritual, it expressed perhaps even more than usual a sense of injustice: How could they be kept from their loved ones in these crucial last moments? They had traveled so far, to a cemetery in the middle of nowhere, but could not follow the body to the end. It was the ultimate, most painful form of social distancing. A middle-aged brother and sister stood together in the hot night. The wind blew the woman’s abaya around her in swirls and the man raised his arms to the sky. “I give you to the care of Imam Ali,” he said to his dead father, referring to a founding figure of Shiite Islam. His sister wept into the wind. Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad.']",None of Iraq’s existing graveyards wanted the bodies of Covid-19 patients. So Shiite leaders created a burial ground for them that is also open to Sunnis and Christians.
Trump Administration Aims to Block New Funding for Coronavirus Testing and Tracing,2020-07-18,,"['Follow our live updates of coronavirus cases and deaths globally. The Trump administration has balked at providing billions of dollars to fund coronavirus testing and shore up federal health agencies as the virus surges across the country, complicating efforts to reach agreement on the next round of pandemic aid. Senate Republicans had drafted a proposal that would allocate $25 billion in grants to states for conducting testing and contact tracing, as well as about $10 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and about $15 billion for the National Institutes of Health, according to a person familiar with the tentative plans, who cautioned that the final dollar figures remained in flux. They had also proposed providing $5.5 billion to the State Department and $20 billion to the Pentagon to help counter the virus outbreak and potentially distribute a vaccine at home and abroad. But in talks over the weekend, administration officials instead pushed to zero out the funding for testing and for the nation’s top health agencies, and to cut the Pentagon funding to $5 billion, according to another person familiar with the discussions. The people asked for anonymity to disclose private details of the talks, which were first reported by The Washington Post. The suggestions from the administration infuriated several Republicans on Capitol Hill, who saw them as tone deaf, given that more than 3.5 million people in the United States have been infected with the coronavirus and many states are experiencing spikes in cases. With unemployment benefits and a number of other aid measures included in the stimulus package set to expire at the end of the month, Congress is rushing to pull together the measure within the next two weeks. The administration’s position presents an added complication to negotiations between Democrats, who are pressing for a more expansive aid bill, and Republicans, who hope to unveil a narrower opening offer for virus relief as early as this week. On Friday, for the second time, more than 70,000 coronavirus cases were announced in the United States, according to a New York Times database. A day earlier, the country set a record with 75,600 new cases, the 11th time in the past month that the daily record had been broken. As the United States struggles to contain surging caseloads and an increasing death toll from the virus, the Food and Drug Administration on Saturday issued its first emergency approval for a testing approach that allows samples from multiple people to be combined for much faster tracking of new infections. The agency gave so-called emergency use authorization to Quest Diagnostics to test combined samples from up to four people — a method known as pooled testing. If the pooled test is negative, then all four are in the clear. If it is positive, then each sample would be individually tested to determine who was infected. The decades-old method has been used to test for the virus in China, Germany, Israel and Thailand. In Nebraska, a state scientist found a loophole that allowed him to circumvent federal prohibitions on the method. The U.S. military has used the technique for diseases at its bases worldwide since it first tested for syphilis in the 1940s. This approach expands the number of people who can be tested without requiring the use of additional crucial materials and staffing. “Sample pooling becomes especially important as infection rates decline and we begin testing larger portions of the population,” the F.D.A. chief, Stephen Hahn, said in a statement. The number of weekly tests reported nationwide has increased to more than five million in early July from about one million in early April, according to data collected by the Covid Tracking Project. At the same time, the rate of positive tests, which had steady declined from late April to early June, has been increasing in recent weeks, the data show. The federal action to speed testing came as at least two states, Arizona and North Carolina, announced single-day records on Saturday. Arizona reported more than 130 new deaths, and North Carolina said it had more than 2,360 new cases. As school districts around the United States debate when and how to reopen schools, a large new study from South Korea offers a note of caution. It found that children between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do, suggesting that middle and high schools in particular may seed new clusters of infection. Children younger than 10 transmit to others much less often, the study found, although the risk is not zero. That is consistent with what many other studies have reported. Several experts said that the study was carefully done and that the results suggested schools should have concrete plans in place for dealing with outbreaks before reopening. “I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won’t get infected or don’t get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore, they’re almost like a bubbled population,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota. “There will be transmission,” Dr. Osterholm said. “What we have to do is accept that now and include that in our plans.” The South Korean researchers identified 5,706 people who were the first to report Covid-19 symptoms in their households from Jan. 20 to March 27, when schools were closed. They then traced the 59,073 contacts of these “index cases.” They tested all of the household contacts of each patient, regardless of symptoms, but only tested symptomatic contacts outside the household. President Trump and his top aides decided to shift responsibility for the coronavirus response to the states during a critical period of weeks in mid-April, focusing on overly optimistic data signals and rushing to reopen the economy, a Times investigation found. Interviews with more than two dozen senior administration officials, state and local health officials and a review of documents revealed a haphazard response during the initial surge in cases in the United States, characterized by offloading authority and, at times, undercutting public health experts. A team in the White House led by Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, met daily on the crisis, but the ultimate goal was shifting responsibility. “They referred to this as ‘state authority handoff,’ and it was at once a catastrophic policy blunder and an attempt to escape blame for a crisis that had engulfed the country — perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations,” write Michael D. Shear, Noah Weiland, Eric Lipton, Maggie Haberman and David E. Sanger. Mayors and governors said that the White House approach was guided by an overarching strategy of reviving the economy, which failed to address how cities and states should respond if cases surged again. Key elements of the Trump administration’s strategy were drafted privately with comment from aides who for the most part had no experience with public health emergencies. And the president quickly came to feel trapped by the administration’s reopening guidelines, which hinge on declining case counts, leading him to repeatedly rail against increasing testing in the United States. The investigation found that White House officials failed to acknowledge the scale of the pandemic until early June, and that even now internal divisions remain over how far to go in having officials publicly acknowledge the fallout of the pandemic. There are no signs to signal the way to the New Valley of Peace, or, as the Iraqis call it, the “Corona cemetery.” But it’s not hard to find: Just follow the cars. It’s the only place they are headed on the rough desert road. Ground was broken on this cemetery in southern Iraq four months ago, and already there are more than 3,200 graves. The backhoes work every night to make new furrows in the sandy soil. The story of how the cemetery came into existence starts when the first coronavirus patients began to die in March in Baghdad. The religious and health authorities were unprepared for the sense of stigma that having the disease carried, as well as the fear that touching the body would risk contagion. People whose relatives had not died of the virus felt it was a stigma to be buried next to someone who had. “I began to see these scenes on TV — I still remember them — there were seven or eight bodies thrown outside a hospital morgue and they left them there,” recalled Sheikh Tahir Al-Khaqani, who is head of the Imam Ali Combat Division, one of the first militias created to fight the Islamic State. Unlike some of the militias that are close to Iran, the Imam Ali brigade is linked to the moderate, inclusive senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The idea came to Mr. Al-Khaqani that the solution was a new graveyard just for those who died of the coronavirus. He conferred with the governor of Najaf, with Mr. Sistani and with the leader of the Shia Endowment, which is in charge of all Shiite financial and real estate matters. Within days, they had a 1,500-acre patch of ground 20 miles from the city of Najaf, allocated for the burials. The Imam Ali combat division volunteered to run the cemetery. Its medical teams took on the job of receiving the dead, disinfecting the body bags in which they arrived and then washing the deceased. Other contingents took responsibility for the digging and burials. Some took on the role of guides to help family members when they come to find their relative’s grave among the thousands stretching out across the desert. Family visits are permitted 10 days after burial. Under orders from the grand ayatollah, although the graveyard is run by Shiites, it welcomes everyone regardless of faith or sect and burial is free. Mohammed Qasim, a date and vegetable farmer from near Baghdad, said those digging the graves, attending to the washing and pronouncing the last rites are “human angels.” “Yes, these are the noblest people I have ever met,” he said. “How can they not be the noblest when they are with death at the same table for breakfast, lunch and dinner and yet they do not complain.” Global roundup António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, raised alarms on Saturday about the economic fallout from the pandemic and the ripple effects it could have on poverty and wealth inequality. “Covid-19 is shining a spotlight on this injustice,” Mr. Guterres said. “Entire regions that were making progress on eradicating poverty and narrowing inequality have been set back years in a matter of months.” Striking a sober tone in a speech honoring Nelson Mandela’s legacy, Mr. Guterres stressed that the pandemic was pushing developing countries to the brink of disaster, and that women, migrants and racial minorities were all likely to suffer disproportionately. “We face the deepest global recession since World War II, and the broadest collapse in incomes since 1870,” he said. “One hundred million more people could be pushed into extreme poverty and we could see famines of historic proportions.” His comments came as David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, urged the Group of 20 major economies to take steps to help the world’s poorest countries by extending a freeze in their official debt payments through the end of 2021, Reuters reported. Speaking to G20 finance ministers meeting virtually, Mr. Malpass also recommended talks on reducing the debt of some countries. Mr. Guterres said the United Nations would continue its mission to assist countries in need, but that the pandemic had demonstrated a severe erosion of social safety nets in countries worldwide. Reflecting on Mr. Mandela’s work to fight racism, Mr. Guterres also said the recent anti-racism movement born out of the killing of George Floyd had caused rising awareness of racial inequality, and that the pandemic had shed light on systemic racism globally. “Covid-19 has been likened to an X-ray, revealing fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built,” he said. In other news around the world: Face coverings will be required in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, whenever people leave home, officials there said Sunday, citing a recent increase in cases. The requirement will take effect on Wednesday. Violations could result in a fine of 200 Australian dollars, or roughly $140. Also in Melbourne, a police-enforced lockdown of nine public housing towers that was widely criticized ended late Saturday after two weeks. But residents of the towers who are infected or in close contact with someone who is infected are still barred from leaving their homes.  Iran started enforcing new restrictions in Tehran on Saturday, banning large gatherings and closing cafes, gyms and some other facilities, as coronavirus cases surge in what health officials say is even worse than the first wave that hit the capital in March. The country has reported more than 270,000 confirmed cases, the 10th highest in the world, but President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that 30 million to 35 million people are “likely to be exposed to the disease in the coming months,” the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported. Chinese officials are battling a growing outbreak in the far western Xinjiang region, the center of the country’s broad crackdown on predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. Thirty confirmed infections have been reported in its capital, Urumqi, since Thursday, 13 of them on Sunday; there are an additional 41 asymptomatic infections. The government flew in 21 lab technicians and their testing equipment from three hospitals in the central city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year, and residential compounds were under lockdown. Lawyers in India say the authorities are seizing on the pandemic as an opportunity to round up critics of the government. Thailand, a rare success story in fighting the virus, has recorded fewer than 3,240 cases and 58 deaths. But its tourism-dependent economy has been ravaged. Some migrant workers from neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia are stuck with no wages from their jobs as hotel cleaners, kitchen hands and food stall operators, and the Thai tourism and sports ministry estimates that 60 percent of hospitality businesses could close by the end of the year. The authorities in Britain have temporarily suspended the release of the daily toll of deaths attributed to the coronavirus, in response to a request from the government after it raised concerns about accuracy. The authorities in England had been including all people who tested positive for the virus in their daily count, regardless of the cause of death — one analysis noted that the current standards would have included someone who tested positive for the virus three months ago and then “had a heart attack or were run over by a bus.” European Union leaders agreed to go back to the negotiating table Sunday after two long, difficult days of talks during which they have been trying to bridge differences over how to distribute and oversee a radical stimulus plan that would send 750 billion euros, or about $840 billion, into the bloc’s economies to push them out of the recession the pandemic has sunk them in. A year from now, the world will begin to gather in Japan to celebrate the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, which were originally supposed to begin this coming week. Or maybe they won’t. Four months after the International Olympic Committee and officials in Japan postponed the Games amid soaring coronavirus infection rates and lockdowns across the world, uncertainty prevails. The unpredictable nature of the virus is making it impossible for officials to say definitively that the Games will happen or, if they do, what they might look like. Maybe there won’t be spectators. Maybe only people living in Japan will be able to attend. Or maybe only those from countries where the virus is under control. Will there be an Olympic village, the traditional home for the roughly 10,000 competitors? Will athletes from the United States, where the pandemic shows no signs of abating, be allowed to attend? In a news conference last week, Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., said that planning for the Games now involves multiple options. All of them, he said, prioritize the health of the athletes. “It includes all different countermeasures,” Bach said of the planning. “An Olympic Games behind closed doors is clearly something we do not want. We are working for a solution that safeguards the health of all the participants and is also reflecting of the Olympic spirit.” Bach has said a further postponement is not an option at the moment; if the Games cannot be held next summer, they will not be held at all. Though tourism is returning to southern Europe — stretching from Portugal to Greece — it is not exactly off to a roaring start. While Europeans are starting to travel more within their own countries, far fewer are venturing beyond their borders, particularly the holiday makers from Britain, Germany and other northern countries who typically journey south each year, spending billions of euros. And visitors from outside the continent are few and far between:  Just 13 countries are on the list of those considered safe by the European Union, a list that so far excludes the United States. The drag is felt acutely in tourist destinations dependent on air travel, like the Canary Islands, hundreds of miles from mainland Spain. Airlines carried 15 million visitors to the archipelago last year, but the flight capacity this month is just 30 percent of what it was a year ago. Italy has tried to promote national tourism by issuing a so-called holiday bonus, a 150-euro voucher per Italian for lodging, up to €500 per family. Dario Franceschini, the minister of culture and tourism, told Parliament this month that about 400,000 vouchers had been issued, worth €183 million in total. According to Italian news reports, however, only a small fraction of hotels accept them. Greece, though suffering less from the pandemic than either Italy or Spain, has still seen scant evidence of a rebound in tourism. In the first 12 days of July, passenger traffic at the Athens airport was down 75 percent from a year ago. Though all of the countries of southern Europe have emerged from lockdown, new outbreaks there and quarantine orders elsewhere have added hurdles. This month, Britain said that people coming from Portugal, among other countries, would be forced to quarantine on arrival, a move that essentially choked off British tourism there. Outbreaks have also occurred around major tourism hubs like Barcelona, where about three million residents were told on Friday to stay indoors to help contain the coronavirus. Carlos García Pastor, the marketing director of Logitravel Group, a Spanish travel operator that had revenue of about €800 million last year, said that his company expected earnings to drop at least 50 percent this year. The final result, he said, “will really depend on how many new outbreaks there are.” Dozens of fiercely loyal members of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front party — mayors, judges, police officials, council members and government bureaucrats — have died over the past two months. All are thought to be victims of the coronavirus, though few have been acknowledged as such, as is the case with most virus fatalities in Nicaragua. Many are officially attributed to “atypical pneumonia.” The string of fatalities has highlighted the fact that the disease is much more widespread than the government has publicly acknowledged. And to critics of the government, the deaths underscore the consequences of President Daniel Ortega’s haphazard and politicized response to the pandemic — with no encouragement of wearing masks or social distancing measures, and little testing and no stay-at-home orders or shutdowns. The government held mass gatherings, including a March rally in support of other stricken countries called “Love in the Time of Covid-19.” Several young epidemiologists, virologists and related specialists said in the medical journal Lancet that Nicaragua’s response “has been perhaps the most erratic of any country in the world to date.” Officially, the government reports that just 99 people have died from the virus, although the Citizens Covid-19 Observatory, an anonymous group of doctors and activists in Nicaragua, has registered 2,397 probable deaths. The government is now taking measures to combat the virus, creating Covid-only hospital units and using the military to organize mass disinfection campaigns. On Sunday, its annual extravaganza celebrating the anniversary of the Sandinista revolution, which toppled the Somoza family dictatorship in 1979, will take place virtually for the first time. But the toll is already high. Carlos Fernando Chamorro, editor of Confidencial, a leading news outlet, said his team had counted some 100 deaths of Sandinistas, including about 10 well-known figures. “The problem is that here, nobody officially dies of Covid-19,” he said. Major League Baseball’s plan to use all 30 of its teams’ ballparks for an abbreviated, 60-game season met an immovable obstacle on Saturday: the Canadian government. The Toronto Blue Jays, the only M.L.B. team based outside the United States, will not be allowed to stage home games during the pandemic. Marco Mendicino, Canada’s immigration minister, announced that the government had turned down the Blue Jays’ request to play at Rogers Centre, where their first game had been scheduled for July 29 against the Washington Nationals. The Blue Jays have been training at home this month, and they had received permission from the city of Toronto and the province of Ontario to play games there. But the federal government ruled that hosting 10 series involving eight visiting teams was not worth the risk. “Unlike preseason training, regular-season games would require repeated cross-border travel of Blue Jays players and staff, as well as opponent teams into and out of Canada,” Mr. Mendicino said in a statement. “Of particular concern, the Toronto Blue Jays would be required to play in locations where the risk of virus transmission remains high.” The Blue Jays said in a statement that they were searching for an alternative park, and an official with knowledge of the Blue Jays’ plans said the most likely destination would be Buffalo, which is nearly a two-hour drive south and is the home of the Blue Jays’ Class AAA team. In Ohio, where case numbers have spiked and some have resisted pleas to wear masks, state officials are using the uncertain future of sports to prod residents to take the virus more seriously. “If we want Friday night football in the fall,” Gov. Mike DeWine posted Friday on Twitter, “we must all take precautions now.” After urging social distancing, mask wearing and hand-washing, Mr. DeWine added “#IWantASeason,” a hashtag he and others have posted repeatedly in recent days. Though governors aren’t known as hashtag trendsetters, the #IWantASeason message has resonated in sports-loving Ohio, where more than 1,600 new coronavirus cases were announced Friday, a single-day record. With some states already announcing plans to limit in-person classes this fall, and with college sports stuck in limbo, the governor’s message has taken on urgency over the past week. Members of the Ohio State University football team have tweeted the hashtag. So has the university’s mascot and marching band. So has the FC Cincinnati soccer team. And so have coaches, players and parents at high schools across the state. “We practiced our fight song dance this morning,” the cheerleading coach at Lakewood High School in Hebron posted on Twitter. “I put the music on then looked up to see one of my seniors sobbing while dancing. We want a season. We want football Friday nights. We want our band. Please do what we need to do so we can have a season!” Similar messages have poured in from the Whitmer High girls’ soccer team in Toledo, which posted a socially distanced photo urging mask usage. And from the Upper Arlington High boys’ soccer team, whose “seniors want to play their last season of high school.” And from the Xenia High Buccaneers. And the Middletown High Middies. And the Woodridge High Bulldogs. “Please wear a mask so we can have a season!” said the account for the Hoover High Vikings football team in North Canton. “It means the world to our guys.” An order to cull almost 100,000 minks in Spain has put the spotlight on the extent to which farmed animals can infect humans with the coronavirus, or vice versa. The culling was ordered on Thursday by the regional authorities of Aragón, in northeast Spain, after seven people linked to a local mink farm tested positive for the coronavirus. When minks at the farm were checked for the virus earlier this month, 87 percent of those tested produced positive results. Joaquín Olona, Aragón’s regional minister of agriculture, told a news conference on Thursday that the authorities were still investigating whether farm workers had transmitted the virus to the minks, or the other way round. The culling, he said, was in any case needed “to avoid the risk of human transmission.” Since the start of the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of minks have also been culled at farms in the Netherlands, which is one of Europe’s biggest breeding nations for minks and their prized furs. An expert from the World Health Organization highlighted mink farms last month when discussing evidence of mutual transmission between humans and animals. Terry Strada breathed a sigh of relief last summer when a military judge finally set a date to begin the death penalty trial of five men accused of planning the attacks that killed her husband and 2,975 other people on Sept. 11, 2001. So did the family members of other victims who have attended the slow-moving pretrial proceedings at the war crimes court at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and were counting on the trial to begin early next year. The pandemic has dashed those hopes. With the proceedings halted, there is a real possibility that the trial will not even have begun by the 20th anniversary of the attacks. “The calamity of Covid is definitely disrupting our personal lives and our hopes for this trial to come to fruition,” said Mrs. Strada, whose husband, Tom Strada, a bond broker, was killed at the World Trade Center. Jury trials across the country have been put on hold as courts struggle with how to safely assemble a judge, witnesses, victims, lawyers and defendant during a pandemic before a reliable vaccine is developed and distributed. The challenge is especially great at Guantánamo because all the participants in the trial except the prisoners have to travel there from across the country, flying in together from Washington, D.C., aboard a military charter airplane. Early in the 20th century, tuberculosis ravaged American cities, taking a particular toll on the poor and the young. In 1907, two Rhode Island doctors, Mary Packard and Ellen Stone, had an idea for mitigating transmission among children. Following education trends in Germany, they proposed the creation of an open-air schoolroom. Their experiment was a success by nearly every measure — none of the children got sick. Within two years, there were 65 open-air schools around the country, either in buildings with large windows on every side or simply held outside. Little of this sort of ingenuity has greeted the effort to reopen schools during the current public-health crisis. The Trump administration has insisted that schools fully open this fall, with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposing no plan for how to do that safely. One of the few things we know about the coronavirus with any degree of certainty is that the risk of contracting it diminishes outside. A review of 7,000 cases in China recorded only one instance of fresh-air transmission. Yet there has been no concerted effort to move as much teaching as possible outdoors. Janitors say they have not been given enough resources, time or training to effectively fight the pathogen. They are often not told if someone has tested positive where they are working, making it difficult to protect themselves and others. Cleaners have recently fallen ill across the country, from the University of Texas at Austin, to a Fox Entertainment lot in Los Angeles, to casinos in Mississippi. Interviews with dozens of workers, employers, cleaning company executives and union officials, as well as a review of records from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, reveal other glaring problems. Airlines have tried to win back customers by raising sanitation standards, but pilots, flight attendants and cabin cleaners report that the efforts are still inadequate, with reused rags, unwiped tray tables and bathrooms that aren’t disinfected between flights. “The only part of the passenger seats that was wiped down was the seat itself,” one pilot wrote in a union report last month. “Not the area that passengers touch constantly, such as seatbelts, window shades, arm rest, etc. Also, the entire plane was supposedly wiped down in less than 10 minutes.” Many of the country’s more than two million custodians do their work at night, unseen, for minimum wage. Cleaning company executives and union officials say that standards have fallen in recent years as businesses have cut back on janitorial services. At a luxury office tower in Miami, Martha Lorena Cortez Estrada resorted to bringing in her own Clorox and gloves and making her own masks. “Our brooms were worn out; we were mopping with just water and no disinfectant,” said Ms. Cortez, 58, who makes $8.56 an hour. Several cleaners said they were expected to clean a space where someone infected may have been, but were not made aware of it. Over the past couple of years, Mike Hill poured more than $3.5 million into renovating his Chevron gas station Blaine, Wash., and opening a Starbucks next door. People from British Columbia were crossing the border in droves to buy cheap gas and milk in Blaine. It seemed like a slam-dunk investment. Then the coronavirus arrived. Now almost no one comes to Blaine anymore. When the border between the United States and Canada closed to nonessential travel on March 21, the southbound traffic into Blaine — the busiest crossing between Washington and British Columbia — slowed to a trickle. In June, just 12,600 people entered the United States from British Columbia, down from 479,600 during the same month last year. The economic impact on Blaine, a city of about 5,000, has been crippling. Beaches are now largely empty save for the rocks left by the receding tide. More than a dozen gas stations that once bustled with people heading elsewhere are quiet. The stores that handled mail-order goods for Canadians looking to avoid taxes are piled high with packages that their purchasers cannot pick up. “We all felt like Blaine was finally going to hit its time,” said Mark Seymour, who works with his father, Steve Seymour, at their oyster farm and restaurant. “And then this happened.” Canada has had about half as many coronavirus deaths per capita as the United States. The number of cases in Canada has been steadily declining since April, while cases in some states are surging. “I’m not very optimistic at all,” Steve Seymour said during a recent interview at the family business, Drayton Harbor Oysters. “Why would they let us in?” As Texas reported single-day records for cases and deaths this week, more than 1,000 of the 1,798 inmates at the Federal Correctional Institute in Seagoville, a suburb of Dallas, had tested positive as of Saturday. In Nueces County, where beach-seeking tourists caused a spike in cases by flocking to Corpus Christi, 85 infants 1 or younger have tested positive since the first case appeared there in March, the county’s public health director said in an interview on Saturday. And in an apparent acknowledgment of the public health risks of holding a large-scale gathering during a pandemic, a federal judge blocked the Texas Republican Party from hosting an in-person convention in Houston, the mayor said on Twitter early Saturday. Many of the babies who tested positive in Nueces County seem to have been infected from close family members who had the virus, said Annette Rodriguez, the health director, and a majority of the babies have had influenza-like symptoms and recovered on their own. The number of infections among babies in the county reflects a rate similar to the one health officials are seeing among adults, Ms. Rodriguez said. And children are generally less likely than adults to become sick from the virus. Ms. Rodriguez said she had released the figure on infants because she hoped that it might prompt more residents to wear masks and follow strict social distancing measures. “To me, if it was my baby and it’s a novel virus that we don’t know a lot about, I would be concerned,” Ms. Rodriguez said. Nueces County has the fastest seven-day-average new case growth of all metropolitan counties in Texas, officials said at a news conference on Friday. As cases in Texas have surged over recent weeks, Gov. Greg Abbott has faced mounting criticism over the state’s reopening strategy. On Thursday, the state reached a single-day record in new infections with 15,038 cases. Early this month, Mr. Abbott announced an executive order requiring masks in public after demurring for months. But in recent days, he has said the state will not consider a second lockdown, even as hospitalizations have surged and deaths from Covid-19 have surpassed 100 per day on average over the past seven days. Harris County, which includes Houston, had 700 people in I.C.U.s fighting the coronavirus, a local news affiliate, citing city health officials, reported on Friday. Some of the largest brick-and-mortar retail stores in the United States announced this week that they would enact policies requiring patrons to wear masks while shopping inside their stores. Home Depot, Lowe’s, Walmart and Best Buy were among those that joined retailers like Costco and Starbucks in embracing mask requirements. C.V.S. said it would require face coverings in its stores beginning on Monday, and Target will do the same beginning on Aug. 1. The corporate decisions to establish these rules comes as many states have issued orders requiring masks in public. But several states seeing a heightened spread of the virus have yet to follow. Utah, Iowa and Nebraska are among the handful of states that have yet to issue statewide policies for masks in public, even as each has seen case counts climbing over recent weeks.  The companies have said the new policies will apply across all of their locations. But many businesses requiring masks have previously run into problems enforcing the rules, as employees have faced violence while confronting customers refusing to comply. Throughout the pandemic, videos circulated online have shown retail workers forced to address angry customers that entered without masks or refused to observe social distancing requirements. Almost daily, President Trump and leaders worldwide say they are racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine. But the repeated assurances of near-miraculous speed are exacerbating a problem that has largely been overlooked and one that public health experts say must be addressed now: persuading people to actually get the shot once it’s available. A growing number of polls find so many people saying they would not get a coronavirus vaccine that its potential to shut down the pandemic could be in jeopardy. Mistrust of vaccines has been on the rise in the United States in recent years, but the rapid push to develop a coronavirus vaccine has generated a different strain of wariness. “The bottom line is I have absolutely no faith in the F.D.A. and in the Trump administration,” said Joanne Barnes, a retired fourth-grade teacher from Fairbanks, Alaska, who said she was otherwise scrupulously up-to-date on getting her shots. “I just feel like there’s a rush to get a vaccine out, so I’m very hesitant.” A poll in May by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that only about half of Americans said they would be willing to get a coronavirus vaccine. One in five said they would refuse, and 31 percent were uncertain. Traveling these days requires lots of research, precision planning and a willingness to play by new and very stringent rules.

"In a Rare Public Appearance, the Queen Knights Captain Tom",2020-07-17,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — When Queen Elizabeth II tapped Sir Tom Moore on both shoulders with a sword at Windsor Castle on Friday, she confirmed the noble status of a 100-year-old man whose achievements during the pandemic had already propelled him into the ranks of Britain’s most exalted citizens. Yet the ceremony was remarkable in a couple of other ways. It brought together two of the greatest living links to Britain’s World War II history — the queen who worked as a young driver and truck mechanic during the war, and a decorated Army officer who fought in the infamous Burma campaign and has found celebrity as the charitable fund-raiser known as Captain Tom. It also brought the queen out of seclusion for her first face-to-face meeting with a member of the public since March 19, when she hastily left Buckingham Palace as the coronavirus bore down on London. Conferring a knighthood on Mr. Moore, who raised $40 million for Britain’s National Health Service by walking 100 laps of his garden, was evidently worth the risk of stepping out. “Tom, with his remarkable achievement, was important to honor,” said Dickie Arbiter, who served as the queen’s press secretary from 1988 to 2000. Equally important, he said, was her decision to show up in person to bestow the honor. “She’s always said she’s ‘got to be seen to be believed,’” he noted. Whether Britons will ever see their revered monarch in person again has become a wistful theme in the British tabloids in recent weeks, one made even more piquant by the once-in-a-century pandemic, which has showcased her ability to take to the airwaves and rally the nation during difficult times. But the queen’s age — she recently turned 94 — and her resulting vulnerability to the virus have raised doubts that she will ever be able to return to her life of diplomatic receptions, garden parties and hospital dedications. Her regular weekly meetings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been conducted by phone since the outbreak began. “Queen heartbreak,” said a typical headline in the Daily Express. “Will we ever see the queen in public again?” The answer, based on Friday’s ceremony, is yes — but at a far stricter remove than in pre-pandemic days. Mr. Moore’s investiture was held outdoors, in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle, rather than inside. Buckingham Palace banned the public, though Mr. Moore was allowed to bring his family. Bearing a sword that had belonged to her father, George VI, the queen approached Mr. Moore, who stood, rather than kneeled, with his walker. Neither wore a face mask, though as Mr. Arbiter noted, “the sword is quite long,” so the two were able to keep some distance. The queen drew closer to present Mr. Moore with the insignia of knight bachelor, and they chatted for a few minutes. The queen’s inability to mingle with her subjects has forced Buckingham Palace to turn to social media. The palace maintains accounts on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, and has posted pictures and videos of her activities, including a photo of her with her husband, Prince Philip, on his 99th birthday. Like other people of her age, a person with knowledge of the palace said, she has adjusted fitfully to technological innovations like Zoom calls. The queen has spoken on video with her grandson Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, who now live in Los Angeles, about the birthday of their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. Her first foray into virtual public engagements was in June, when she and her daughter, Princess Anne, spoke to a group of health workers — the queen occupying the center square on the familiar checkerboard of people staring into their screens. Royal watchers say the queen’s use of video calls has offered a glimpse into her personal interactions that is not often seen in images of her chatting in receiving lines. During a recent call with three members of the British military serving overseas, she served up a mix of stilted questions and wry asides. When Lance Cpl. Shanwayne Stephens of the Royal Air Force told the queen that he moonlighted as the pilot of the Jamaican bobsled team, she replied, “Gosh, sounds a very dangerous job,” and quizzed him about how he trained. Corporal Stephens told her he pushed cars up and down the road near his home in Peterborough, England. “Well I suppose that’s one way to train,” she said, as her eyes widened. The queen has kept up other official duties. She still digests official government papers that are delivered to her in red boxes. A few days before July 4, she spoke by phone with President Trump, who wished her a “happy birthday, marking 94 extraordinary years,” according to the White House. But the only other time she appeared in public was in June, when she watched a military parade to mark her birthday. She sat alone under a white canopied pavilion, flanked by two officers, as the first battalion of the Welsh Guards marched in socially distanced formation on the greensward of Windsor’s quadrangle. Windsor was also the site of a surprise wedding on Friday for the elder daughter of Prince Andrew, Princess Beatrice, who married a British property developer, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The couple had canceled their royal wedding in May. The queen and Prince Andrew witnessed the small ceremony, which Buckingham Palace said was private and socially distanced but still somewhat upstaged Mr. Moore’s investiture. Given her age and the danger of a second wave of infections, the queen is likely to remain an isolated figure for the foreseeable future. It is not clear she will even make her annual summer retreat to Balmoral Castle in Scotland, given the Scottish government’s concerns about visitors from England importing the virus. While certain kinds of interactions may never return, royal watchers noted that the large majority of Britons only experience the queen via television anyway. “She’s not going to disappear,” said Valentine Low, royal correspondent for The Times of London. “The idea that we’ll never see her again is kind of ridiculous.” In May, the queen won extravagant praise for a televised address in which she recalled her military service and exhorted Britons to pull together in the spirit of the Blitz to confront the pandemic. Her parting words, drawn from a famous wartime song by Vera Lynn, spoke to those who miss her. “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return,” the queen said. “We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”']","In the weeks before the ceremony to honor the 100-year-old war veteran and fund-raiser, some had wondered whether Britons would see Queen Elizabeth in person again."
Southern Europe Opens Its Doors to Tourists. Not Many Are Coming.,2020-07-19,By Raphael Minder,"['ADEJE, Spain — Music blared from a beachfront cafe along the normally bustling southwestern coast of Tenerife, the largest of Spain’s Canary Islands. But several tables sat empty, a month after a Covid-19 lockdown had ended, and the doors to many resorts remained shut. Though tourism is returning to southern Europe — stretching from Portugal to Greece — its restart has been sluggish amid new outbreaks in some countries. Bookings are down 80 percent in Italy despite government incentives. Ferries to the Greek islands are carrying well under half the load they once did. While Europeans are starting to travel more within their own countries, far fewer are venturing beyond their borders, particularly the holiday makers from Britain, Germany and other northern countries who typically journey south each year, spending billions of euros. And visitors from outside the continent are few and far between:  Just 13 countries are on the list of those considered safe by the European Union, a list that so far excludes the United States. The drag is felt acutely in tourist destinations dependent on air travel, like the Canary Islands, hundreds of miles from mainland Spain. Airlines carried 15 million visitors to the archipelago last year, but the flight capacity this month is just 30 percent of what it was a year ago. As a result, property owners in the Canary Islands have opened only about 20 percent of the tourism beds in the archipelago, according to Jorge Marichal, a Tenerife hotelier who is president of Cehat, the Spanish hotel confederation. “We are doing our best to highlight the fact that we now have almost no virus problem — but of course we cannot transport the tourists here ourselves,” Mr. Marichal said. Italy has tried to promote national tourism by issuing a so-called holiday bonus, a 150-euro voucher per Italian for lodging, up to €500 per family. Dario Franceschini, the minister of culture and tourism, told Parliament this month  that about 400,000 vouchers had been issued, worth €183 million in total. The Italian news media painted a less enthusiastic picture. The newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that only a small fraction of Italian hotels accept the vouchers. Greece, though suffering less from the pandemic than either Italy or Spain, has still seen scant evidence of a rebound in tourism. In the first 12 days of July, passenger traffic at the Athens airport was down 75 percent from a year ago, and 84 percent at the country’s 14 regional airports. Though all of the countries of southern Europe have emerged from lockdown, new outbreaks there and quarantine orders elsewhere have added hurdles. This month, Britain said that people coming from Portugal, among other countries, would be forced to quarantine on arrival, a move that essentially choked off British tourism there. And Britons have traditionally been the top visitors to the Algarve, the southern region of Portugal. Britain’s move drew fire from Augusto Santos Silva, Portugal’s foreign minister, who called it “absurd.” Still, Portugal has faced a strong uptick in coronavirus cases, including in municipalities surrounding its capital, Lisbon. Outbreaks have also occurred around major tourism hubs like Barcelona, where about three million residents were told on Friday to stay indoors to help contain the coronavirus. Carlos García Pastor, the marketing director of Logitravel Group, a Spanish travel operator that had revenue of about €800 million last year, said that his company expected earnings to drop at least 50 percent this year. The final result, he said, “will really depend on how many new outbreaks there are.” This month, hundreds of thousands of Spaniards were placed back under temporary lockdown by the regional authorities in Catalonia and Galicia after new outbreaks. Mr. García Pastor said some clients canceled their bookings as soon as they heard about the new restrictions. “Tourism is extremely reactive, for better or worse,” he said. In the Canary Islands, home to more than two million full-time residents, officials have trumpeted their strict safety measures and their low coronavirus caseload, less than 1 percent of the nation’s total. The archipelago’s hotels require guests to wear a face mask in the lobby and other indoor areas, and they limit the number of people who can lounge around their swimming pools. The protocols drew praise from Zurab Pololikashvili, the secretary general of the World Tourism Organization, an agency of the United Nations, after his visit to tourism destinations in Italy and Spain this month. That portrait of safety contrasts sharply with the picture that emerged from the Canary Islands in late January, when the archipelago recorded Spain’s first coronavirus case, a German tourist who tested positive on the island of La Gomera. Weeks later, one of the large establishments on Tenerife, the H10 Costa Adeje Palace, became the first European resort to lock down after the virus was detected among Italian guests. But as the virus rampaged across mainland Spain, the islands quickly brought their own outbreaks under control. The archipelago has reported 162 deaths, according to the latest official Spanish data, out of 28,420 victims nationwide. Travel within the Canary archipelago has continued, perhaps even encouraged a bit by the travel hurdles. Smaller islands like El Hierro that do not have an international airport have reported an influx of Canarians this summer. But across the islands the doors remain shut to many of the large resorts normally filled by international package tours. At the recently reopened Adeje Palace, some guests said they had been relocated there at the last minute by their travel agents because the hotels they had booked were still closed. “A week before leaving Germany, I wasn’t sure that this vacation could actually go ahead, but I had reached the point where I desperately needed time away from my hospital work and no longer really cared about which hotel I would stay in,” said Svetlana Arsenijevic, an anesthetist from the German city of Halle. A Swiss tourist, Anaïs Zufferey, said that she and her sister not only had to switch hotels at the last minute, they also had to set off from Zurich a day later than planned because their initial flight was canceled. “It’s a holiday that has required us to be very flexible,” Ms. Zufferey said. But their journey from Tenerife’s airport to their hotel was more than comfortable — they were the only passengers on a 50-seat shuttle bus. Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.']",Most tourist beds are empty in Spain’s Canary Islands.

Showdown on Beach in Bulgaria Balloons Into Political Crisis,2020-07-19,By Boryana Dzhambazova and Patrick Kingsley,"['SOFIA, Bulgaria — Leaked photographs of the prime minister. A police raid on the president’s office. A business tycoon’s takeover of a public beach. A looming no-confidence vote in the government. And the largest street protests in seven years. Bulgaria is gripped in a political crisis, its biggest since 2013, when sustained protests against corruption brought down a center-left government. Now demonstrators are trying to oust their right-wing successors, who face similar accusations of corruption, judicial interference and servility to wealthy businessmen. The poorest member of the European Union, nestled on the bloc’s southeastern frontier, Bulgaria is both a focus of the tussle for influence between the West and Russia, and an example of a decline in democratic standards in several parts of the continent. But it is also a specific and unusual case. In Hungary and Poland, Europe’s two most prominent victims of democratic backsliding, the governing party is driving the subversion of the democratic process. In Bulgaria, the charge is led by a wider range of actors, both inside and outside the government — including a small group of wealthy businessmen. The current unrest was set off by the revelation that a stretch of publicly owned coast had been reserved for the private use of a prominent businessman and power broker. For many, this crystallized fears that the Bulgarian state has fallen under the grip of outside influence, prompting tens of thousands to demonstrate in cities across the country. “There is this sense of having come to a fork in the road,” said Vessela Tcherneva, head of the Sofia branch of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research group. “Several things are happening at once,” Ms. Tcherneva added. “But first and foremost, there is the sense in the general public that the social contract, which rests on rules being applied equally to everyone, has been broken.” The crisis began when an opposition politician, Hristo Ivanov, filmed himself landing a boat on a nominally publicly owned stretch of the Black Sea coast. Plainclothes state security agents shoved Mr. Ivanov back into the water, illustrating how the beach is unofficially reserved for the private use of an influential politician and businessman, Ahmed Dogan. The episode drew condemnation from the country’s mainly ceremonial president, Rumen Radev, and set off a flood of protests at the influence that wealthy power brokers like Mr. Dogan exert over political life, state resources and, in this case, public land. “We wanted to expose that the whole state is serving the interests of Dogan,” Mr. Ivanov said in a telephone interview. Public outrage was quickly compounded when the police later raided the president’s offices and detained two members of the president’s staff. Protesters perceived the moves as retaliation for Mr. Radev’s criticism of Mr. Dogan. State institutions “have been captured by a group of people to serve their own interests instead of functioning independently as they should,” said Daniel Smilov, an analyst at the Center for Liberal Strategies, a political research group based in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital. The tension was exacerbated by a steady drumbeat of embarrassing and sometimes bizarre leaks about government officials, including Prime Minister Boiko Borisov. An unverified photograph recently published in the Bulgarian news media showed him half-naked and apparently sleeping beside a handgun. Another unverified image seemed to show Mr. Borisov’s bedside table stuffed with bank notes and gold bars. Mr. Borisov has confirmed that the room is his, but he has said that the gun and money are not, and that the images were manipulated. News outlets have also published a set of recordings of a man who sounds like Mr. Borisov speaking in private about state affairs. Thousands of Bulgarians have gathered since last Thursday in a central square in Sofia to chant outside Mr. Borisov’s office, calling for his resignation and that of the chief prosecutor. Last Wednesday, Mr. Borisov tried to assuage them by announcing that he was considering firing three senior government ministers. But he refused to leave his own post — leading protests to spread to other cities. “People are sick and tired of the collusion between the mafia and the state,” said Neli Trifonova, a 27-year-old online retailer who attended a protest on Monday. “We see it everywhere.” Opposition lawmakers have put forward a motion of no confidence in the government, which Parliament is scheduled to debate on Monday, though Mr. Borisov’s majority seems likely to hold. On Wednesday, Mr. Borisov’s party released a statement denying it was working under the influence of Mr. Dogan’s party, which he founded in 1990, after the collapse of communism. Mr. Dogan’s party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, is mainly supported by members of Bulgaria’s ethnic Turkish minority, and has only occasionally been a formal part of government. But the group and its leading members, like Mr. Dogan, have amassed outsize influence in Bulgaria’s politics, economy and media by consistently performing the role of political kingmakers. “In Bulgaria, you don’t have a strongman,” said Dimitar Bechev, an expert on southeast Europe at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “It’s more of an oligarchic system.” On Monday, the American Embassy issued an unusually forceful statement backing the protests. “We support the Bulgarian people,” the statement said, “as you peacefully advocate for increased faith in your democratic system and promote the rule of law in Bulgaria.” The force of the statement contrasted with the less strident tone taken by European institutions and leaders. Some colleagues from the European Parliament’s centrist grouping even issued messages of support for Mr. Dogan and his party. Though the rule of law is nominally central to the philosophy of the bloc, European leaders have consistently avoided taking too strong a stance against governments that stray from democratic standards at home. “The E.U. is a mechanism for creating consensus,” Ms. Tcherneva said. “The E.U. is not that good at confrontational situations.” Boryana Dzhambazova reported from Sofia, and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.']","Bulgaria is gripped by its worst political turmoil since 2013, leading to calls for the government to resign."
Brazil Health Workers May Have Spread Coronavirus to Indigenous People,2020-07-19,"By Manuela Andreoni, Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — The telltale symptoms began in late May, about a week after government medical workers made a routine visit to the Kanamari Indigenous community in a remote part of the Amazon: Elderly members of the group were struggling to breathe. For months, as the coronavirus tore through Brazil, the Kanamari had sought to shield themselves from the pandemic by strictly limiting access to their riverside villages in the secluded Javari Valley, one of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territories. But it seemed even there, the virus had reached them. Panic set in. “Many people grabbed some clothes, a hammock and ran into the forest to hide,” said Thoda Kanamari, a leader of the union of Indigenous peoples in the vast territory, home to groups with little contact with the outside world. “But it was too late, everyone was already infected.” And the vectors of the disease, according to interviews and federal data obtained by The New York Times, may have been the health workers charged by the federal government with protecting the country’s Indigenous populations. More than 1,000 workers with the federal Indigenous health service, known as Sesai, have tested positive for coronavirus as of early July, a freedom of information request and interviews with union representatives found. Working without adequate protective equipment or access to enough tests, these workers may have inadvertently endangered the very communities they were trying to help, medical workers and Indigenous leaders said. More than 15,500 Indigenous Brazilians have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, including at least 10,889 living in protected territories, according to Instituto Socioambiental, an Indigenous rights organization. At least 523 have died. In the sparsely populated Javari Valley, in northwestern Brazil, the federal Indigenous health care agency said it had identified 220 cases and one death. Robson Santos da Silva, the Army colonel at the head of Sesai, defended the agency’s response during the pandemic, and brushed off criticism as “a lot of disinformation, a lot of politics.” “We’re on the front lines,” he said. “We’re battling this disease daily.” In an emailed statement, Sesai said reports that health workers had exposed Indigenous people to the virus were “inconclusive.” The agency said its employees were outfitted with protective equipment. “All this planning and early research led to timely and efficient care that was delivered in villages,” the statement said. But The Times found that in at least six field offices, the share of infected workers was above the Amazon region’s average of 8 percent for the general population. Two field offices in particular had extraordinarily high rates of infection, according to tallies compiled by health care unions. The office overseeing the state of Amapá and the northern part of the state of Pará reported that 186 people — almost half of its health workers — had tested positive for the virus. And in the office covering the Yanomami community, which straddles the border between Brazil and Venezuela, 207 workers — more than 20 percent of the medical staff — became infected. Representatives of the health care workers’ union and experts say the true caseload among the federal Indigenous health workers is likely much higher. Many of those on the front lines have sought tests on their own, but as of June 30, the Indigenous health service had only tested 1,080 of its employees, roughly five percent of its work force. The large share of infected workers suggests “there were failures in the protection of health care workers at a critical moment, affecting teams that care for a highly vulnerable population,” said Felipe Tavares, who researches Indigenous health at the Federal Fluminense University. Health care workers, Indigenous leaders and experts described a bungled response beset by the broader shortcomings that have turned Brazil into a global epicenter of the pandemic. Brazil has recorded 78,772 coronavirus deaths and more than two million confirmed cases as of Sunday — numbers that are second only to the United States. Tests have been in short supply and often unreliable, which means some doctors and nurses with asymptomatic or undiagnosed cases have traveled to vulnerable communities and worked in them for days. Some teams have had to procure their own masks and other protective gear. Lax and poorly-communicated quarantine protocols, and the absence of effective contact-tracing, have allowed the virus to spread with ease among people living in close quarters. Indigenous leaders said it’s impossible to determine with certainty how many cases were introduced by health care workers. Some Indigenous people may have brought the virus into their communities after traveling to cities to gather supplies and emergency government aid. Illegal miners and loggers who operate in Indigenous territories may also have exposed some communities. Luiza Garnelo, a doctor and anthropologist at Fiocruz Amazônia, a government health research agency in the Amazon, said the pandemic had exposed the defenselessness of communities that had already been grappling with substandard medical care, poverty, and often violent land invasions. “Long before the epidemic hit, investment in Indigenous health care was insufficient and the resources that are available were not harnessed in a way that enabled an effective response to the epidemic,” she said. “The Indigenous population is socially and economically vulnerable.” Some communities pleaded for more robust medical care as the pandemic gripped Brazil. “Since March we have been begging, we need help, we need help, we need emergency hiring of health care workers,” said Júnior Yanomami, who heads the Indigenous council at the Yanomami health department in Boa Vista, the capital of the state of Roraima. But at least 90 of the 131 health care workers assigned to Boa Vista during the outbreak have tested positive, according to Mr. Yanomami. They were, unwittingly, among the primary vectors for infection of the 262 Yanomami people who have been diagnosed with the virus, he said. Five of the Yanomami have died. When Mr. da Silva, the Army colonel who heads the Indigenous health agency, flew to several Yanomami villages in late June to deliver protective equipment and administer tests, tribal leaders said, they felt like they were being used for photo ops. “We want the government to help Indigenous peoples, as it is their obligation to do, but not like this,” Mr. Yanomami said. Carmem Pankararu, the president of the Indigenous health care workers union, said workers were hobbled by a bureaucracy that was slow to get tests and critical supplies to regions where transportation and logistics are extraordinarily hard even in normal times. “They would only test when we showed symptoms,” she said. “We needed mass testing.” Criticism of President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic, within Indigenous territories and beyond, is mounting. After losing two health ministers who were physicians, in April and May, Mr. Bolsonaro put the health ministry in the hands of an active-duty Army general, who has filled the ministry’s senior ranks with military officers who are not experts in health care. Early this month, a judge on Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered the government to redouble efforts to shield Indigenous people from the virus by coming up with a comprehensive plan within 30 days and setting up a “situation room” staffed by officials and Indigenous representatives. More recently, another Supreme Court judge generated consternation in the Bolsonaro administration by warning that the armed forces could be held responsible for a “genocide” over their handling of the pandemic in Indigenous communities. Several Sesai workers who spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation, described an exceptionally challenging mission, impaired by poor guidance, mistrust from many Indigenous communities and a scarcity of tests. Enoque Taurepang, the coordinator of the Indigenous Council of Roraima, said doctors and nurses had been set up for failure. “You can’t blame health professionals because they didn’t have the tools necessary to act,” he said. Meanwhile, the losses to the Indigenous mount. Edney Kokama, a leader of the Kokama tribe, lost his father and his grandfather to the virus, which he said had killed at least 58 members of the tribe in Brazil. His grandfather and his grandfather’s wife, who also died, were among the most fluent writers of the tribe’s language, which younger members don’t know as well. “My grandfather was editing a Kokama dictionary. He was one of the few who still spoke it,” he said. “We’ve lost so much knowledge.”']","Many people assigned to care for the Indigenous have been infected, exposing remote communities to the virus.

"Police Have Too Much Access to People’s Data, German Court Rules",2020-07-17,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — The German police and intelligence agencies have excessive access to citizens’ mobile and internet communications, the country’s Constitutional Court said on Friday, ordering the existing laws to be tightened. It was the latest decision by the court to support personal privacy over public security concerns in the digital sphere, which, taken together, have made the country a world leader in protecting personal privacy. Critics charge that the string of court decisions could hinder the ability of security services to prevent crimes and terrorist attacks. Under existing laws, the police and prosecutors can tap into an individual’s cellphone and internet data in the course of a criminal investigation, allowing them to see basic personal information that is stored by the telecom providers. Germany’s federal police can ask those providers for someone’s personal data as part of the investigation. That can include a person’s name, telephone numbers, home or I.P. addresses and birth date. Law enforcement authorities use the information to help them piece together crimes or track down terrorist suspects. But the information can be gathered without any concrete evidence linking an individual to a particular crime, raising fears that the information could be abused. The court ruled on Friday that while the transmission of such data was legally permissible, officials have too much leeway to obtain the information. It ordered current laws to be revised by 2021 to ensure that they “sufficiently limit the purposes for which the data is used.” Namely, the court ruled that only when the police or investigators have concrete evidence linking an individual to a specific crime will they be allowed to access the digital information. Katharina Nocun, a civil rights activist, and Patrick Breyer, a member of the European Parliament for the Pirate Party, brought the case before the court in 2013.  They welcomed Friday’s ruling as a victory for personal privacy rights and democracy. “The ruling confirms that the legal hurdles for pervasive encroachment in the private sphere are far too low,” Ms. Nocun said. “Targeted interventions instead of new surveillance interfaces should be the name of the game in a democracy.” Ms. Nocun drew a connection to recent scandals that have rocked the German police, involving far-right sympathizers within their ranks who are suspected of leaking information to neo-Nazi groups that have threatened left-leaning lawyers and activists, including herself. She said she had received several online threats from groups identified with links to the police. “This experience only strengthened my resolve that we need strong legal controls for authorities’ access to sensitive data to prevent abuses,” Ms. Nocun said on Twitter. In a 2012 ruling on the issue, the court determined that in an increasingly digital world, investigators needed the “simplest possible method for tracing telephone numbers to individuals” to carry out their jobs. But Friday’s ruling was the latest attempt to revise that decision, and the court suggested that telecom providers develop a “back door” that would allow the authorities to call up the information they have a right to, while at the same time protecting more sensitive personal data.']",The Constitutional Court said that the current laws did not do enough to protect personal privacy in the digital realm.
"As if Yemen Needed More Woes, a Decrepit Oil Tanker Threatens Disaster",2020-07-17,By Rick Gladstone,"['Think of Yemen’s challenges, and war, starvation, disease and poverty come to mind. Now add another attribute: a rusting, neglected 1,188-foot tanker moored off the country’s western coast, laden with roughly 48 million gallons of oil, at risk of sinking or even exploding at any time. The United Nations and a variety of environmental experts have warned for years that the vessel, the FSO Safer, is like a floating bomb, one that could cause an ecological crisis with any leak in one of its 34 storage tanks. Together, they hold four times the amount of oil spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. A spill could further upend the lives of Yemen’s 28 million people, kill untold populations of fish and birds, poison coral reefs, gum up desalination plants and close the Red Sea shipping lanes and ports that are Yemen’s sole lifeline for international aid. The Safer’s rusting hull and corroding pipes and valves are not the only worries. It is not far from Hudaydah, a hotly contested port city, and the risks of a stray shell or bomb striking the vessel cannot be ruled out. “Should the situation get out of control, it will directly affect millions of people in a country that is already enduring the world’s largest humanitarian emergency,” Inger Anderson, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told the Security Council on Wednesday in a briefing about the tanker problem. “It will destroy entire ecosystems for decades and go beyond borders.” Prevention of either a spill or explosion aboard the Safer, Ms. Anderson said, “is really the only option to avoid an environmental and human catastrophe.” The vessel, which requires extensive upkeep, has not been properly maintained since war broke out more than five years ago between the Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led military coalition that has been trying to crush them. The Yemeni oil company that owns the Safer says it does not have the resources to service the vessel, which historically has functioned as a floating storage facility fed by the Marib-Ras Isa pipeline, which carries oil from eastern Yemen. A skeletal crew remains aboard, but much of the machinery used to prevent combustible buildups of gas in the tanks no longer operates. The Houthis, who control the region that surrounds the mooring area, have long balked at United Nations requests to assess the vessel’s condition. But they appeared to have a change of heart after a seawater leak into the Safer’s engine room in May, which the crew and an emergency team of divers sent by the vessel’s owner were able to temporarily patch. Speaking at the same Security Council briefing as Ms. Anderson, Mark Lowcock, the top relief official at the United Nations, said that the Houthi leadership had confirmed in writing that it would allow a long-planned U.N. mission to appraise the tanker, “which we hope will take place within the next few weeks.” Still, Mr. Lowcock was guarded in his optimism. In August of 2019, the Houthis consented to a United Nations request to inspect the tanker, only to cancel it the night before. The Houthis’ reluctance to relinquish control over the vessel stems in part from the group’s desire to sell the oil, or at least to use it for bargaining leverage with their Saudi adversaries. But the coronavirus pandemic has severely reduced the price of oil, making the Safer’s contents much less valuable. Moreover, the oil has been languishing in rusting tanks for at least five years, which may have befouled it. “The Houthis may think, ‘We need to get rid of this before this becomes a massive problem for us,’” said Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, an online service that monitors maritime shipments and storage of petroleum. “I would like to think that is the case.” Moreover, he said, the Safer’s cargo “is probably contaminated — this would be the last deposit of oil you would want to buy.” Ian M. Ralby, the founder and chief executive of I.R. Consilium, a maritime security consultancy, said it was possible that Houthi leaders who once viewed the Safer as an asset “may now see the benefit in allowing the situation to be resolved.” If there were an oil disaster, he said, “the fallout would rest on their heads, and they can’t afford the permanent black mark, having negative and fatal implications.” Other environmental and maritime shipping experts who have been keeping track of the Safer say there is no simple fix. The best hope, some said, is that once the U.N. inspectors can appraise the vessel’s condition, a salvage team will be permitted to siphon the oil out of its tanks into other vessels, then tow the Safer to a secure port for scrapping. How that can be done in the midst of a war zone, further complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, constitutes another underlying challenge. The task at hand is to keep a bad situation from getting worse, said Christopher M. Reddy, a marine scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who has studied the effects of oil spills like the Deepwater Horizon disaster. “We have a problem, it has a potential for harm, so how do we do it to create the least amount of damage?” he said.']",A rusting vessel used for years to store oil off Yemen’s coast poses what the United Nations has called a dire and entirely preventable threat of ecological catastrophe.
Fire Hits Cathedral in French City of Nantes,2020-07-18,By Elian Peltier,"['A fire broke out inside the cathedral of the western French city of Nantes in the early hours of Saturday, but the authorities quickly said there was no comparison with the blaze that engulfed Notre-Dame in Paris last year, despite ominous images of flames and smoke coming from the building. Over 100 firefighters were sent to the cathedral in Nantes after they were alerted shortly before 8 a.m., but the “violent fire” was controlled in hours, according to Gen. Laurent Ferlay, the head of the firefighters in the Loire Atlantique area, which includes the city. “It is not a scenario like at Notre-Dame de Paris,” General Ferlay told reporters, adding that the fire, though contained, was not yet extinguished. “The roof hasn’t been hit,” he noted. General Ferlay said that the fire had broken out near the organ of the cathedral and had destroyed the instrument entirely. The authorities have opened an arson investigation; three separate starting points for the blaze have been detected. Father François Renaud, who is in charge of the cathedral, told Agence-France Presse that stained-glass windows from the 16th century had burst in the fire, and that the platform on which the organ rested was in danger of collapsing. Images from inside the cathedral showed charred wooden debris and stones shattered on its floor. The Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a Gothic building in Nantes that was built across four centuries and completed in 1891, was previously suffered a fire in 1972, which destroyed much of its wooden framework. It was replaced with a structure in concrete, which General Ferlay said had helped limit the damage this time. French television stations broadcast images of thick smoke pouring out of a giant stained-glass window, a painful reminder for many of the blaze that devastated Notre-Dame and sent its spire crashing through the roof, bringing the Paris landmark to the verge of collapse. “After Notre-Dame, the Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul cathedral, in the heart of Nantes, is in flames,” President Emmanuel Macron of France wrote on Twitter. “Support for our firefighters who take all risks to save this Gothic jewel of the city.” Prime Minister Jean Castex traveled to Nantes on Saturday afternoon, visiting the damaged cathedral and praising the firefighters who responded to the fire. “How are you? Not too tired?” he asked some of them. “Bravo.” The fire in the French capital last year started in the attic, ravaging the famed latticework of ancient timbers known as “the forest,” before spreading to the towers, and it left three jagged openings in the vaulted ceiling of Notre-Dame, one of Europe’s most visited monuments. Workers are continuing to delicately remove about 40,000 pieces of twisted scaffolding from the precarious stone structure that were melted in the Notre-Dame fire. The blaze changed the face of Paris and prompted a nationwide reckoning over the state of France’s 86 cathedrals and tens of thousands of other monuments, which historians had long warned were being neglected. The origin of the Notre-Dame fire is still unknown, but investigators have focused on the possibility of a short-circuit in the electrified bells of the spire, or in elevators that had been set up among scaffolding. Cigarette butts, which were found on the scaffolding, have also been suspected. Mr. Macron, who had vowed to rebuild the cathedral within five years, said this month that the cathedral had to be restored in a way that would be “as true as possible,” to its “complete, coherent and last known state.” In Nantes, a city of about 300,000 people near the Atlantic coast, it took 13 years to reopen St. Peter and St. Paul after a fire tore through the cathedral’s roof in 1972. Father Hubert Champenois, the rector of Nantes, who witnessed the fire decades ago, told the French television channel BFMTV on Saturday that the blaze on Saturday did not look as devastating. Johanna Rolland, the mayor of Nantes, said on French television that she had been allowed inside the cathedral with firefighters and saw reasons for optimism, while acknowledging the trauma. “The damages are real, but they are localized,” she said, adding that it was “a sad day for Nantes and its people.”']","The images of smoke pouring out of the Gothic building were a painful reminder of the fire that mauled Notre-Dame in Paris, but the authorities said the damage would not be as serious."
"Defying Kremlin, Protesters Stage Biggest Rally Yet in Russian Far East",2020-07-18,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Ignoring pleas from the Kremlin for calm after more than a week of unrest, protesters in the Russian Far East on Saturday staged their biggest display of defiance yet, with tens of thousands of people pouring into the streets to protest the arrest of a popular regional governor. Russian news media reported that 50,000 or more people had joined a rally in the capital of Khabarovsk Krai, a sprawling territory nearly 4,000 miles east of Moscow. Thousands more attended protests in other regional towns and in Vladivostok, a port city on the Pacific Ocean in neighboring Primorsky Krai. The government in Khabarovsk, the regional capital, said in a statement that only 10,000 people had gathered “at the beginning” but gave no figure for the overall turnout. Police officers in Khabarovsk made no effort to stop what the authorities described as an “illegal” but peaceful protest and instead handed out face masks. In Vladivostok, however, a number of arrests were reported. The protests began after the arrest on July 9 on murder charges of Khabarovsk’s governor, Sergei I. Furgal, one of a handful of regional leaders not affiliated with a party entirely controlled by the Kremlin. Instead of being held in Khabarovsk, where authorities allege the crimes took place, Mr. Furgal was flown to Moscow immediately after his arrest, a move seen by many locals as an unwarranted intrusion into their affairs and an effort by the Kremlin to grab control of the case. The case has crystallized longstanding resentments in Russia’s far-flung regions toward Moscow, which is often seen as demanding loyalty while giving little in return. In a blow to local pride, the Kremlin responded to Mr. Furgal’s election victory in 2018 over its own candidate by rejiggering bureaucratic boundaries in the Far East to give primacy to Vladivostok, Khabarovsk’s longtime rival. Mr. Furgal is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, a far-right outfit that has grown increasingly restive over its Kremlin-assigned role as a decorative and largely powerless “opposition” party in Russia’s tightly controlled political system. In an interview with The New York Times this past week, the leader of the party, the nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, complained that the Kremlin “treats us like idiots” and gives no space for real opposition. He said that after Mr. Furgal took office, the Kremlin had tried to get the new governor to quit the Liberal Democratic Party. Protesters on Saturday focused their chants and banners on mostly local grievances, demanding that Mr. Furgal be returned to his home region and given a fair trial. They chanted “freedom, freedom” but muted the denunciations of President Vladimir V. Putin that were heard at earlier protests. All the same, the large turnout, particularly unusual in Russia’s quiescent hinterland, posed a bold challenge to the Kremlin, exposing deep wells of public anger as Russia struggles with the economic damage left by the coronavirus pandemic and growing fatigue with political stagnation. State-controlled television ignored the protests, sticking to its line that Russia is united in joyous support for Mr. Putin after a recent national plebiscite in which 78 percent of voters endorsed constitutional amendments allowing him to remain in office until 2036. But the vote, rigged from the start, only highlighted how hollow Russia’s democratic rituals have become. Mr. Putin, whose approval rating slumped to a 20-year-low after the coronavirus hit Russia, was supposed to step down at the end of his current term in 2024, but under the amended constitution he can now run for two more six-year terms. Events in the Far East, however, have highlighted the weakness of once reliable methods of control. Saturday’s protests delivered a dramatic defeat to frenzied efforts by the authorities, both local and national, to tamp down public anger with pleas and threats. The Kremlin’s special envoy for the Far East, Yuri P. Trutnev, rushed to Khabarovsk last week to express an understanding of the protests while demanding that they stop. The Federal Security Service soon announced that it had foiled a terrorist plot in Khabarovsk, stirring fears of a crackdown on protesters under the pretext of fighting terrorism. Then, officials warned protesters that they risked spreading the coronavirus, and ordered that people stay away from all “illegal” gatherings for health reasons. The authorities even recruited the arrested governor, Mr. Furgal, in their efforts to halt the protests. Speaking in Moscow on Thursday, his lawyer, Boris Kozhemyakin, told reporters that the jailed governor “thanks” the protesters “but does not approve of these mass actions.” But that failed, too, with Mr. Furgal’s supporters thronging the streets in even larger numbers. “Moscow go away,” read one banner on Saturday.']","Despite pleas and threats from Moscow, tens of thousands gathered peacefully in Khabarovsk and other cities to protest the arrest of a popular regional governor."
"Nicaragua’s Ruling Sandinistas Fall Victim to Covid-19, Highlighting the Disease’s Spread",2020-07-18,By Frances Robles,"['A string of recent deaths across Nicaragua — including mayors, judges, police officials, sports figures, university rectors and government bureaucrats — is pointing to the chilling reality that the coronavirus is devastating this Central American country, although the government is not publicly acknowledging it. To critics of the government, the deaths are a result of President Daniel Ortega’s haphazard and politicized response to the pandemic with no encouragement of wearing masks or social distancing measures, and little testing and no stay-at-home orders or shutdowns. Instead, the government has encouraged large gatherings. That response seems to have hit members of the governing Sandinista National Liberation Front party the hardest. Several young epidemiologists, virologists and related specialists said in the medical journal Lancet that Nicaragua’s handling of the coronavirus “has been perhaps the most erratic of any country in the world to date.” “They were the only ones going around without masks,” said Dora María Tellez, a former health minister under the Sandinistas who broke with the party, “as the mask came to be considered a sign of opposition.” Francisco Aguirre Sacasa, a former Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington, said the deaths of the public officials were strikingly obvious when you looked at the National Assembly and saw a lot of empty chairs in the Sandinista side. “You can’t just ignore that,” he said. “You can’t hide it. You can’t cover that up,” he added. “It is obvious, obvious, that Sandinistas have been dying.” Still, the deaths of few officials have been publicly attributed to Covid-19 — as is the case with most virus fatalities in Nicaragua. Many are officially designated as “atypical pneumonia.” Officially, the government reports that just 99 people have died from the virus, although the Citizens Covid-19 Observatory, an anonymous group of doctors and activists in Nicaragua, has registered 2,397 probable deaths. Mr. Sacasa, the former ambassador, said one of the Sandinista legislators who died of Covid-19 in late May was his cousin, María Manuela Sacasa de Prego, although she also had cancer. “Her kids told me she died of Covid,” Mr. Sacasa said. The government has now created Covid-only hospital units and mass disinfection campaigns are being organized by the military. But many critics say one clear sign that those measures came too late are the high-profile deaths of the party’s own members. The government is preparing for its annual July 19 anniversary extravaganza celebrating the victory of the Sandinista revolution, which toppled the Somoza family dictatorship in 1979. The event, held every year at a public square in the capital, Managua, features hundreds of thousands of people bused in from throughout the country. They wear matching T-shirts and carry black-and-red party flags before a dais where all the leading government officials sit. But this year, for the first time in its 41-year history, the event will be held as a virtual concert — and absent major members of the party who have died in recent weeks. Dampening the festive mood further, on Friday, the United States Treasury Department sanctioned the son of Mr. Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, who is also the vice president of the country. The son, Juan Carlos Ortega, manages a media company “which he uses to stifle independent voices, spread regime propaganda, and defend the Ortegas’ violence and repression,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. Nicaragua, which spent the past two years battling a popular uprising, was one of a few countries that never shut down schools and businesses and never issued a stay-at-home order. Trying to stave off economic collapse, the government continued to organize mass events, even after the pandemic was raging around the world. A March rally, advertised as being held in solidarity for countries suffering coronavirus deaths, was called “Love in the Time of Covid-19.” Beauty pageants, boxing matches, art fairs, food festivals and other events organized by the government also continued as planned, as Sandinista lawmakers mocked opposition legislators for wearing masks. Nicaragua’s response to the pandemic has “been lambasted throughout the world as one of the worst,” said Mateo C. Jarquín, a Nicaraguan professor at Chapman University in California who was one of the authors of the Lancet article. “We should recognize all governments are struggling,” he wrote. “What has no excuse is the lack of transparency and the blatant manipulation of information.” In May, the government released a report justifying its approach to the pandemic. The report noted that a desperately poor country like Nicaragua could ill afford an economic shutdown. Many people in Nicaragua must work to eat and cannot stay home, the government said. But it did not explain why it allowed large gatherings to continue even as similarly popular, crowded events were canceled worldwide. Among the recent deaths of Sandinista officials was that of Orlando Noguera, the former mayor of Masaya, a city 15 miles south of Nicaragua’s capital. He was best known for a crackdown on anti-government protesters two years ago that left seven people dead in his city. Relatives of Eden Pastora, a government ally and a prominent figure in the nation’s civil war, said he did not have the illness. But his death certificate, which was read to The New York Times by a family member, showed Mr. Pastora died of “atypical pneumonia” — the usual official designation for a coronavirus death. Orlando J. Castillo, the head of the government telecommunications office who had recently been sanctioned for human-rights violations by the United States Treasury Department, died on June 2. Local media, citing family sources, said the cause was Covid-19. When a top police official, Olivio Hernández Salguera, died in May, his family insisted he had suffered a fatal heart attack. But the media reported that his body was buried the same day he died, as is customary in Nicaragua when people die of Covid-19 — suggesting that he had the disease. Ms. Tellez, the former Sandinista health minister, provided The Times with a list of 38 Sandinistas who were believed to have died of the coronavirus and said some 200 names have circulated on social media. She also said that Mr. Ortega does not appear to be following his government’s own strategy because he has not been seen in public for over a month, the second time he disappeared during the pandemic. Carlos Fernando Chamorro, editor of Confidencial, a leading news outlet, said his team has counted some 100 deaths of Sandinistas, including about 10 well-known figures. “The problem is that here, nobody officially dies of Covid-19,” he said. The Nicaraguan government funnels all media inquiries to Ms. Murillo, the vice president. She did not respond to requests for comment. In public comments, she has acknowledged the deaths of the prominent government officials, but did not give the cause. They had “transitioned to another plane,” Ms. Murillo said. “We live their legacy with the strength of the revolution,” she said following the deaths of two officials. “Our revolution makes us strong every day.” Orlando Obando Cabrera, a Sandinista regional councilman in Bluefields, on the Caribbean coast, posted videos on his Facebook page in which he implored Nicaraguans to stop looking for people to blame for the health crisis. “If I die in this struggle and you want to find someone responsible, don’t look for it in the government,” Mr. Obando said in a video posted May 26, acknowledging that he was being treated for the illness. “If something happens to me, don’t blame Daniel, don’t blame Rosario, don’t blame others.” Two days later, he vowed to beat Covid-19. On June 13, Mr. Obando died. Alfonso Flores Bermúdez contributed reporting from Managua, Nicaragua.']","The haphazard, politicized response to the pandemic by the country’s leaders has put the government’s own officials and supporters at particular risk."
"A ‘Significant Return to Normality’ by Christmas, U.K. Prime Minister Says",2020-07-17,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Stadiums and concert venues in England may reopen in the fall, but nightclubs will remain closed. All schools will welcome students by September, but wedding receptions will be limited to 30 people. And while pubs and restaurants reopened in England earlier this month, the local authorities will be granted new powers to close them when coronavirus cases flare. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain laid out a road map on Friday to simultaneously ease lockdown restrictions and to contain the spread of the coronavirus in the coming months, the steps toward reopening came with a clear warning: There will not be a “significant return to normality” until November at the earliest, and “possibly in time for Christmas.” Britain has suffered more than any other European country from the coronavirus, with more than 45,000 dead and nearly 300,000 infected, although it has succeeded in significantly reducing the number of casualties after they rose sharply in April and into May. Still, the lockdown has delivered a brutal jolt to businesses large and small, with at least 650,000 jobs lost in the first months of the pandemic, and the country expected to register its largest decline in annual G.D.P. in 300 years. Now, as the country braces for a second wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Johnson is walking something of a tightrope as he tries to restart the economy — people will no longer be encouraged to work from home starting next month — while also ensuring that the country’s health service is not overwhelmed. “I know some will say this plan is too optimistic, that the risks are too great and that we won’t overcome the virus in time,” Mr. Johnson add at a news conference from Downing Street. Britain should “hope for the best,” he added, but “plan for the worst.” The changes he announced on Friday apply only to England, as Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have broad latitude to set their own guidelines in response to the pandemic. In discussing what will, and what won’t, be possible in the coming weeks and months, Mr. Johnson made clear that until a vaccine was widely available and there are no upticks of new cases, Britons should be prepared to bounce back and forth between eased restrictions and new shutdowns. “The timetable I am about to set out is conditional,” Mr. Johnson said. “It is contingent on every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly.” Any changes in the future, however, are likely to be localized, Mr. Johnson said, as England moves from “blanket, national measures,” to “targeted” action. The local authorities will be granted extended powers to cancel events or close public spaces if they face outbreaks, as was the case with Leicester, 100 miles north of London, where a second lockdown was imposed. On Friday, Mr. Johnson also announced that the government would provide an additional three billion pounds ($3.75 billion) for Britain’s revered National Health Service, which was the subject of widespread adulation even as the government was accused of mishandling the crisis. “We are making sure we are ready for winter, and planning for the worst,” Mr. Johnson said. Maybe more than in any other European country, opposition politicians, experts and organizations in Britain have denounced the authorities’ response to the pandemic as riddled with flaws and false promises. Britain has been one of the worst-hit countries in the world as the pandemic has disproportionately affected minorities, devastated its nursing homes, and exacerbated concerns about the economic prospects of a no-deal Brexit. A plan to track coronavirus infections has largely failed, and Mr. Johnson’s announcements have left many baffled. When Mr. Johnson’s top aide, Dominic Cummings, flouted lockdown measures, the outcry turned against the prime minister, just months after his Conservative Party won parliamentary elections by a landslide. Mr. Johnson struck a careful tone on Friday as he announced that the authorities would soon stop encouraging people to work from home. It would be up to companies to craft plans for a gradual return to work. “Instead of government telling people to work from home, we are going to give employers more discretion, and ask them to make decisions about how their staff can work safely,” he said. Mr. Johnson’s announcements also paved the way for the potential reopening of West End theaters, although operators have long said that hosting an audience while maintaining social distancing would not be viable. In England, pubs and restaurants were allowed to begin hosting patrons inside again earlier this month, and indoor gyms and pools will be able to reopen next week, at the same time that masks will become compulsory in shops and supermarkets.']","“Hoping for the best but planning for the worst,” Boris Johnson said as he announced a road map for reopening England, and granted local authorities extended powers to tackle regional outbreaks."
"Ending an Era, British Airways Retires Fleet of Boeing 747s",2020-07-17,By Megan Specia,"['LONDON — British Airways will retire its entire fleet of Boeing 747 airplanes, the company said on Friday, citing the travel downturn and the aircraft’s high operating costs. The decision marked not just the finish of a storied plane’s service with the company but also symbolized the end of an era of aviation in which the next generation of planes was always expected to be bigger, as well as better. Even 50 years after their introduction, the sight of 747s gliding into their docks, dwarfing other planes, could evoke a thrill in the most jaded of travelers. The world’s first jumbo jet, known as the “Queen of the Skies,” the 747 revolutionized travel for the masses, but in recent years it had fallen out of favor with a number of airlines because of the costs. The final commercial flight of a Boeing 747 by an American carrier took place at the end of 2017. But British Airways had held on, operating the world’s largest fleet of the planes, with 31 in service. A handful of other commercial carriers still fly the 747, though their use is expected to further dwindle in the coming years. “It is with great sadness that we can confirm we are proposing to retire our entire 747 fleet with immediate effect,” British Airways said in a statement. “It is unlikely our magnificent ‘Queen of the Skies’ will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the Covid-19 global pandemic.” When the Boeing 747 began service in 1970, it was the height of modern travel technology, with room for 27 first class and 292 economy class passengers. Its iconic, humped upper deck, equipped with a lounge, or “club in the sky,” became synonymous with luxury travel. With a tail height equivalent to a six-story building and a wingspan equal to 50 parked cars, the 747 was part of a period of innovation that saw engineers develop larger and larger planes that could be filled with more passengers and in that way drive down ticket prices. But fuel costs in 1970 were so negligible that they were barely a factor in the airlines’ financial strategies. In recent years, advances in technology made the four-engine 747 far pricier to operate than modern twin-engine planes. The move is especially poignant for British Airways, which received its first Boeing 747-400 in 1989 and its last in April 1999. The predecessor of British Airways, BOAC, began flying versions of the 747 in the early 1970s. At the height of the craft’s deployment, British Airways had 57 of the jumbo jets and was the second-biggest operator of the planes, after Japan Airlines, which had more than 100 in its fleet. Some commercial carriers still operate passenger flights on the 747, including Air China, Korean Air and Lufthansa. A number of companies, including UPS, also use the 747 freighter to transport cargo. Other airlines have also recently retired their fleets, including Qantas of Australia, which accelerated plans to do so because of the coronavirus pandemic and held had a series of farewell flights for the last of its 747s this week. The final 747 in that airline’s fleet will depart Sydney later this month and be stored in the Mojave Desert in California. The last order for a passenger version of the 747 came from the U.S. government, which in 2017 commissioned two of the jets from Boeing for use by the president, as Air Force One aircraft. The planes — a repurposed version of the 747-8 — are scheduled for delivery in 2024. Bloomberg News reported this month that Boeing had quietly pulled the plug on production of the 747. Some parts of the British Airways fleet may fly again, with engine components and metal from the fuselage often stripped for other uses. For the most part, however, specialist companies are hired to dismantle and scrap planes that airlines no longer fly. British Airways was set to retire the last of its Boeing 747s in 2024, but as the coronavirus saw travel grind to a halt, threatening the finances of airlines the world over, that time frame was pushed forward. British Airways has been a company in crisis since the pandemic began, with the financial fallout threatening thousands of jobs. In April, the carrier’s parent, the Madrid-based International Airlines Group, announced plans to restructure British Airways that could result in up to 12,000 people losing their jobs.']",The disruption of travel during the coronavirus pandemic hastened the company’s plans to pull the iconic aircraft from commercial service.
India Offers Escape to Afghan Hindus and Sikhs Facing Attacks,2020-07-19,By Mujib Mashal and Fahim Abed,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Indian government said it will expedite visas and the possibility of long-term residency for Afghanistan’s tiny Hindu and Sikh minorities, shrunken by decades of persecution and decimated by attacks in recent years amid the Afghan war. “India has decided to facilitate the return of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan to India,” the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement on Saturday. The statement, on the rescue of an Afghan Sikh leader who was abducted in eastern Afghanistan last month, did not provide further details. An Indian official in Kabul said the decision meant that any of the roughly 600 Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan, an overwhelmingly Muslim country, would be given priority visas and the opportunity to apply for long-term residency once they arrived in India. In interviews, many welcomed the emergency option, but said it posed an agonizing dilemma. In Afghanistan, they have livelihoods — shops and businesses passed down through generations — but spend their days dreading the next attack. Making a new start in India would most likely mean living in poverty, they said, particularly during an economic slump exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Lala Sher Singh, 63, who lives near a Sikh temple in Kabul that was attacked in March, said the community had shrunk so much that his thoughts were occupied “day and night” by a fear that the next assault might not leave enough people who can perform the final rituals for the dead. “I may get killed here because of these threats to Hindus and Sikhs, but in India I will die from poverty,” he said. “I have spent my whole life in Afghanistan. In this neighborhood close to the temple, if I run out of money and stand in front of a shop and ask for two eggs and some bread, they will give it to me for free. But who will help me in India?” There was no official reaction from the Afghan government to India’s offer. A senior Afghan official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the news media, said that violence affected all Afghans, and that an offer of safety to Hindus and Sikhs put religious diversity in Afghanistan in doubt. The official said the move appeared aimed at a domestic audience in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to move the country away from its secular, multicultural foundations and give it a more overtly Hindu identity, while projecting itself as a champion of persecuted Hindu minorities elsewhere. The Hindu nationalist government recently amended India’s laws in a way that critics say blatantly discriminates against Muslims, giving a fast track to citizenship for migrants who are Hindu or members of five religious minorities — but not Muslim migrants. The law is one reason Muslims feel increasingly demonized and marginalized in India, though they are the second-largest religious group, making up one-seventh of the population. The status of Afghan religious minorities is more uncertain than ever, as the United States withdraws troops after more than 18 years and the Taliban, who ruled oppressively in the 1990s, prepare for talks with the government over power-sharing. The battlefield has grown more chaotic, joined by more extreme groups such as a branch of the Islamic State which specifically target vulnerable minorities. The Hindu and Sikh communities in Afghanistan once numbered in the tens, if not the hundreds, of thousands, with well-established businesses and high-ranking positions in the government. But nearly all have fled to India, Europe, or North America over decades of war and persecution. In the eastern province of Nangarhar, only 45 families remain from thousands before. In Paktia, another eastern province, only a single family remains — Jagmohan Singh, an herbal doctor, and his wife and two of their children. Their other two children have already decamped for Kabul. “A few decades back, there were around 3,000 families of Hindus and Sikhs in different areas and districts of Paktia,” Dr. Singh said. “Except my family, all of them fled.” As their numbers have shrunk, Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan often live in the same large compounds and sometimes also share a place of worship. Just over 600 Hindus and Sikhs now live across Afghanistan; two major attacks in the past two years have killed about 50, leaving practically every family scarred. The most recent attack was a six-hour siege by Islamic State militants on a Sikh temple and housing complex in Kabul, in March, that left 25 people dead, including young children. After the attack, as community leaders expressed alarm, Afghan officials, including the national security adviser, promised new safety measures. But Narendra Singh Khalsa, the community’s representative in the Afghan Parliament, said the temple remained shut and unrepaired. Except for a few additional police officers in the area, they had not received any support that would ease their concerns. “They have made some checkpoints where a number of police officers are present,” said Warjet Singh, 22, who runs a shop outside the temple, where his mother, father and brother were killed. “But the officials know that they cannot prevent any attack with a police officer standing in front of the temple,” he added. “There is no change in our situation,” he said. “I am still risking my life when I come out every morning for work; I am still worried about another attack on our compound.” Mr. Singh, who received financial assistance from the Afghan government, said life had become unbearable since the attack took his family and deprived him of a place of worship. His wife, who is pregnant with their first child, has dreaded going to the hospital because a maternity ward was recently attacked and mothers and babies were killed. “When India provides a long-term visa, I will go and live there until the security situation is better in my own country so I can return,” Mr. Singh said. “No one will take my country from me, but it’s important for me to survive so I can come back when things are good.” At best, India may be like a lifeboat — an emergency option for the families who take it, but one that lacks the security of a long-term solution. The relatives of Rawail Singh moved to New Delhi more than a year ago, but life there has not been easy. Mr. Singh was an activist who was one of 14 Sikhs killed in a 2018 suicide bombing in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, as they were filing in for a meeting with President Ashraf Ghani. Mr. Singh’s wife, Preeti, said she moved her three children to India in the months after her husband’s death. Her 16-year-old son, Prince, found work as an apprentice at a tailor shop, where he was paid about $110 a month. With that, bolstered by occasional aid sent by friends from Afghanistan and elsewhere, the family made do in the two rooms they rented for $30 a month. But as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, Prince lost his job; the tailor said he could no longer afford to pay apprentices. Preeti said her family spent their days confined to their two rooms, waiting for help to pay the rent. Prince is still looking for a job, but he has not found anything yet. “No one is giving us work,” he told his mother recently. “People say, ‘I can barely feed my own family, let alone hire you.’” Farooq Jan Mangal, Zabihullah Ghazi, and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.']","Members of the dwindling minority communities, gutted by recent deadly violence, welcomed an emergency exit but expressed worry that what would await them in India is poverty."
"India Rounds Up Critics Under Shadow of Virus Crisis, Activists Say",2020-07-19,By Sameer Yasir and Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — After spending several anxious days in prison, Natasha Narwal, a student activist accused of rioting by the New Delhi police, thought her ordeal was nearing an end. A judge ruled that Ms. Narwal had been exercising her democratic rights when she participated in protests earlier this year against a divisive citizenship law that incited unrest across India. But shortly after the judge approved Ms. Narwal’s release in late May, the police announced fresh charges: murder, terrorism and organizing protests that instigated deadly religious violence in India’s capital. Ms. Narwal, 32, who has said that she is innocent, was returned to her cell. “I felt like crying,” said her roommate, Vikramaditya Sahai. “We are grieving the country we grew up in.” As India struggles to quell surging coronavirus infections, lawyers accuse the authorities of rounding up government critics and keeping them in detention in the middle of a pandemic. It is part of a strategy, they say, to stifle activists who are protesting what they see as iron-fisted and anti-minority policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In recent weeks, Ms. Narwal and nearly a dozen other prominent activists — along with potentially dozens of other demonstrators, though police records are unclear — have been detained. They are being held under stringent sedition and antiterrorism laws that have been used to criminalize everything from leading rallies to posting political messages on social media. India’s coronavirus restrictions, some of which are still in effect, have blocked pathways to justice, lawyers and rights activists say. With courts closed for weeks, lawyers have struggled to file bail applications, and meeting privately with prisoners has been nearly impossible. Law enforcement officials in New Delhi, who are under the direct control of India’s home ministry, have denied any impropriety. But rights groups say the arrests have been arbitrary, based on scant evidence and in line with a broader deterioration of free speech in India. In a lengthy report released this month, the Delhi Minorities Commission, a government body, accused the police and politicians from Mr. Modi’s party of inciting brutal attacks on protesters and supporting a “pogrom” against minority Muslims. Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said cases against the activists appeared to be “politically motivated,” and that the police had devised a formula for keeping people like Ms. Narwal in jail: When a judge orders the release of a prisoner for lack of evidence, new charges are introduced. “The urgency to arrest rights activists and an obvious reluctance to act against violent actions of the government’s supporters show a complete breakdown in the rule of law,” she said. Before the pandemic hit, Mr. Modi was in the throes of the most significant challenge to his power since becoming prime minister in 2014. After Parliament passed a law last year that made it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become Indian citizens, millions protested across the country. To critics, the citizenship law was more evidence that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist government planned to strip the country’s Muslims of their rights. Tensions peaked in February when sectarian violence and rioting broke out in New Delhi. The vast majority of people killed, hurt or displaced were Muslim, and the police were involved in many of those cases. After Mr. Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in late March to contain the coronavirus, shutting down businesses and ordering all 1.3 billion Indians inside, the protests disbanded. Lawyers said the police then moved to detain demonstrators while skirting complaints against government allies. Among those in custody are a youth activist who raised awareness about police brutality against Muslims; an academic who gave a speech opposing the citizenship law; and Ms. Narwal, a graduate student who co-founded Pinjra Tod, or Break the Cage, a women’s collective that organized some of the largest rallies. Nitika Khaitan, a criminal lawyer, said the crackdown had also pushed beyond higher-profile critics to include ordinary residents of riot-hit neighborhoods. She recently challenged those arrests in a jointly signed letter to the Delhi High Court. Lawyers have tracked a few dozen such arrests under the lockdown, though Ms. Khaitan said the true figure could not be verified because police reports had not been made public. Many detentions were “not in compliance with constitutional mandates,” she said. In a recent interview, Sachidanand Shrivastava, the police chief in New Delhi, said his officers were conducting fair investigations. In May, the authorities said they had detained about 1,300 people for involvement in the protests and riots, including an equal number of Hindus and Muslims. Recently, the police arrested a group of Hindus for forcing nine Muslim men to chant “Hail Lord Ram,” a reference to a Hindu god, before killing them and throwing their bodies into a drain. “It is very important that the police force remain impartial,” Mr. Shrivastava said. “And we are following this principle from Day 1.” But members of India’s judiciary have questioned the official numbers, accusing the police of withholding information about the arrests under national security protections and singling out Muslims for many of the harsher charges. In court proceeding notes reviewed by The Times, a judge hearing a case against a Muslim protester wrote that the police appeared to be targeting only “one end” without probing the “rival faction.” During the riots, the police were accused of abetting Hindus and, in some cases, torturing Muslims. Khalid Saifi, a member of United Against Hate, a group that works with victims of hate crimes, was arrested after he tried to mediate between the police and protesters, according to his lawyers. The police charged him with being a “key conspirator” of the riots. His wife, Nargis Saifi, said he was tortured in custody. “His only crime is he is a Muslim,” she said. M.S. Randhawa, a police spokesman, denied that Mr. Saifi had been tortured, adding that he has regular opportunities to speak to a judge if abuse occurs. “These are just allegations,” Mr. Randhawa said. “He would have told the magistrate if he had been tortured.” But rights advocates accuse Mr. Modi’s government of shielding party officials — and more broadly, of Hindus involved in the violence. Ms. Narwal, who was detained in May, could face at least several years in prison for helping organize demonstrations that blocked a busy road in northeast Delhi, where February’s bloodiest battles between Hindus and Muslims broke out. The police have accused her of playing a leading role in the riots, charging her with murder, attempt to murder and being part of a “criminal conspiracy.” At the same time, the police have been accused of ignoring complaints against Kapil Mishra, a local politician with Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party who gave a fiery speech threatening to remove Ms. Narwal and other protesters forcibly if the authorities did not take action. Hours after the ultimatum, the streets erupted. But charges were never filed against Mr. Mishra, who has denied a role in starting the riots. A New Delhi police superintendent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that some officers had wanted to act against Mr. Mishra, but that they were pressured by the force’s leadership not to touch “the warriors of the government.” “We did not even try,” the superintendent said. “The directions were clear: Don’t lay your hands on him.” Through an intermediary, Mr. Mishra declined to comment. Ms. Narwal’s father, Mahavir Narwal, said the government was moving India closer to authoritarianism and demonizing anybody who questioned its policies. For weeks, prison officials ignored his calls and emails to Tihar Jail, where Ms. Narwal is being held. With coronavirus restrictions in place, she was moved into an isolation ward at one point, where she stayed for 17 days, said Mr. Narwal, a retired scientist. Lately, communication has smoothed out. But Mr. Narwal said the subtext of his daughter’s arrest seemed clear: “If you protest, you will be called a terrorist.” “All she did was fight to keep the soul of India alive,” he said.

"Melbourne Lockdown Elicits Hope, Anger and Vows of Resilience",2020-07-17,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau.  Last week’s letter, about the mood in Melbourne during our second strict lockdown, prompted a flood of feedback from readers. People shared with us how they’re coping, thanked us for mirroring their perspective and criticized us for a lack of self-awareness. Here is a sampling of those reader responses: During the first lockdown, we were all truly “in this together.” Now it’s just metro Melbourne and the comments from the rest of the country do make it feel like we’ve done something wrong here, although I don’t think Melburnians have been more complacent than other parts of the country. Having gyms close again was really rough. The first time I went to the gym since they shut, I felt better than I had since March. That said, we’re going to get through this stronger. It was pretty likely that this was going to happen, so if we’re first in the country to get our second wave (I don’t think we’ll be the last), let’s get on with it. Last time, the never-ending uncertainty was rough, while at least now I can circle a date in the calendar.  — Kissairis Muñoz — I missed my 75th birthday celebrations with my extended family, and our 50th wedding anniversary celebrations, thanks to COVID-19 isolation. So sad. But then, there is next year to celebrate. Hopefully.  — Joe Slaven, Townsville, Australia — The piece on Melbourne was complete tripe that appears to be written by some poor soul with no resilience and nothing to do but lay about wallowing in their own self-pity. This is not reflective of all Melburnians and I’d suggest not really indicative of most Melbourne residents. Cozy “fires at the pub,” country trips in winter — what an idealistic load of rubbish doing nothing other than to paint an unrealistic picture of this city and it’s inhabitants!  — Mark Pepper — There is a stark difference between Lockdown 1.0 and Lockdown 2.0. The first time around it seemed that everyone was making an effort to find the funny, irreverent and touching moments to brighten all our days. Then as lockdown started to ease, ugliness started to creep in; in emotions, in behavior, in words, in government rhetoric. Now in Melbourne there is very deep anger, anxiety and a sense of division. So what do I do to try and remain positive? I am spending less time watching the news, catching highlights and then turning it off. I am dipping into loved books and making my way through a backlog of new potential favorites. I am walking — no matter the weather. This is not negotiable. I am trying to pick up the phone and have conversations instead of relying on texting and emails. I am touching base with my neighbors. I am much less inclined to do this than last time, which means it is more necessary. I am giving myself the freedom to drink as much coffee as I need to get through this.  — Michelle — Greetings from Houston, Texas, USA. I normally love these dispatches but this one gives me pause. We here would love concerns about oysters and champagne at home, missed sunny vacations and stalled pool laps. But instead we are grappling with issues associated with a corrupt federal government which refuses to protect its citizens, political debate pertaining to masks, a surging virus and economic collapse. The author’s complaints seem trite in comparison. I wish her concerns were the problems of this country. — Dana M. Gannon — It was great to read the letter from Besha because something shines out when somebody writes what is clearly the truth, the exact way she is feeling. I hope it engenders in all her readers, as it did for me, a feeling of sympathy, a kind of loving feeling — and I hope that she and her fellow Victorians discover something special and important in the next few weeks. Then, when it is all over, come up here to Queensland for a big hug.  — Michael — I have always found winter to be daunting (I grew up on the Connecticut shore — talk about gray, cold winters) and have generally huddled inside for 12 Melbourne winters. But this year is something different. After the vicious summer bushfires, the rain started, generous but not imposing. It has kept on for months, and now Melbourne is green and lush and sooooo gorgeous. With the help of recently purchased electric bikes, my partner and I have discovered a vast network of bike and walking paths from our base. Now those chilly days are simply *days* that we might discover a new route or revisit a favorite. I grieve for the lost connections and routines, and I am also deeply grateful to live in a country that cares about people, and I’m knocked off balance, and I’m worried about our collective mental health. What helps right the balance for me are the joys of wending along a lush path on a cool, bright afternoon, of seeing the full sky at sunset, and of breathing and moving through the world. And having someone to share both the lockdown and the exploration with — that makes most things just fine.  — Katherine Russell — Today’s letter, bathed in self-pity and almost entirely lacking perspective, is a paean to middle class self-centeredness. Boo hoo, you can’t have fake Christmas. Where is the concern for people who are less fortunate and therefore likelier to get sick and die? Oh, it rains a lot in winter? Maybe we should take up a collection for your suffering soul! In parts of the US, we’ve been self-isolating since early March. Six weeks sounds like a minute to me. The author sees this new lockdown as something imposed rather than a call to social good.  She’s swimming, all right. Swimming in blind privilege and self-pity.  — Cathy Harding — I too dread Melbourne winters. I too plan special events or holidays away to get us through it. I too am dreading another period of remote learning for my daughter and I too celebrate a significant anniversary and had planned on being in Spain, but then we thought Queensland, and now it appears we will be in luck if we can go out for dinner. There is something different about this lockdown than the first. Something darker. I also feel the undercurrent among family and friends — and yes, all those strangers on the internet — of anger, frustration, darkness and fear. I greatly appreciated your reminder that once this is done, it will almost be spring.  — Kate Elizabeth Cotter Here are this week’s stories. How Koalas With an S.T.D. Could Help Humanity.

London Police Urged to Apologize After Officer Knelt on Man’s Neck,2020-07-18,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — The lawyer for a Black man who repeatedly asked a white officer to “get off my neck” as he was pinned to the sidewalk during an arrest in London told a court on Saturday that the encounter echoed the treatment of George Floyd in the United States and called for a police apology. The Metropolitan Police have suspended the arresting officer, who knelt on the neck of the detainee while he was handcuffed and lying on the ground. A second officer, who assisted in the arrest on Thursday, was removed from operational duty pending an investigation into what the force’s deputy commissioner, Steve House, called an “extremely disturbing” episode. Images of the arrest, captured on video, were a troubling reminder of the killing of Mr. Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The police in London and the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, have condemned the tactics used in the arrest. Officers in England and Wales are not trained to put pressure on an individual’s neck or face. “Some of the techniques used cause me great concern,” Mr. House said in a statement on Friday. “They are not taught in police training.” The killing of Mr. Floyd has prompted a global reckoning over police violence and systemic racism, with departments across Britain facing intense scrutiny of their tactics. Critics have cited a disproportionate number of searches in areas with large Black, Asian and ethnic minority populations, particularly during the pandemic, and say practices such as handcuffing are more likely to be used against Black people. In footage of the scene on Thursday, two officers can be seen pinning the handcuffed man down; one holds his leg, while the other presses his knee on the man’s neck for about 15 seconds and tries to push his head to the sidewalk. The detainee can be heard saying, “Get off my neck” several times as passers-by confront the officers. After the officer releases his knee, the handcuffed man can be seen sitting and talking with the second officer.  Mr. Khan, the London mayor, said on Twitter that he was “deeply concerned” by the video and supported the decision to refer the matter to the independent police watchdog. The police identified the man in the video as Marcus Coutain, 45, who was detained after reports of a fight in the area because he fit the description of a suspect and was carrying a knife. Mr. Coutain appeared in court on Saturday. His lawyer, Timur Rusten, said at the hearing that the officers’ actions during the arrest mirrored “almost identically what happened to George Floyd.” He said that Mr. Coutain had been carrying a knife to fix his bike and that the police should apologize for his treatment. Ben Bowling, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at King’s College London who has studied policing in Britain for 30 years, said that while abusive techniques were not new, it was “astonishing to see a police officer, with his knee on a man’s neck when he’s in handcuffs and on the ground, just weeks after the death of George Floyd in the U.S.” “Power is insufficiently restrained in policing London,” Mr. Bowling added. “It is a pattern that is affecting Black Londoners, and it’s unacceptable.” Handcuffing practices by the police in Britain came under the spotlight this month after Bianca Williams, a top British athlete, filmed officers who had stopped her and her partner, Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese sprinter, in West London. Ms. Williams, 26, and Mr. dos Santos, 25, who are both Black, were ordered out of their car and handcuffed in front of their 3-year-old son. The encounter, during which Ms. Williams and Mr. dos Santos were found to have done nothing wrong, fueled anger at police tactics that were said to disproportionately target Black people in Britain. Cressida Dick, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, acknowledged that the episode involving the athletes had “raised lots of concerns for people” and said that her force would review handcuffing practices. Regarding the officer who knelt on the man’s neck on Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said, “Our officers understand that their actions will be scrutinized as they go about their work and that the public have the right to hold them to account where appropriate.”']","In a video, the detainee, who is Black, can be heard repeating, “Get off my neck,” as a white officer pins him.

China Is Using Uighur Labor to Produce Face Masks,2020-07-19,"By Muyi Xiao, Haley Willis, Christoph Koettl, Natalie Reneau and Drew Jordan","['As the coronavirus pandemic continues to drive demand for personal protective equipment, Chinese companies are rushing to manufacture the gear for domestic and global consumption. A New York Times visual investigation has found that some of those companies are using Uighur labor through a contentious government-sponsored program that experts say often puts people to work against their will. Uighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the Xinjiang region of northwest China. The program sends Uighurs and other ethnic minorities into factory and service jobs. Now, their labor is part of the P.P.E. supply chain. According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51. After reviewing state media reports and public records, The Times found that at least 17 of those companies participate in the labor transfer program. The companies produce equipment primarily for domestic use, but The Times identified several other companies outside Xinjiang that use Uighur labor and export globally. We traced a shipment of face masks to a medical supply company in the U.S. state of Georgia from a factory in China’s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers had been sent. The workers are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their loyalty to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies. The program is widely publicized in state media as a form of poverty reduction. The Human Rights Investigations Lab at the University of California, Berkeley and the Uyghur Human Rights Project have both collected dozens of videos and social media reports that document the recent labor transfers. Uighurs have long been persecuted by the Chinese government, which says its tight control over Xinjiang is necessary to fight what it calls religious extremism. In a response to The Times, the spokesman for China’s Embassy in the U.S. said the program helps “local residents rise above poverty through employment and lead fulfilling lives.” Quotas on the number of workers put into the labor program and the penalties faced by those who refuse to cooperate, however, mean that participation is often, in effect, involuntary. “There are these coercive quotas that cause people to be put into factory work when they don’t want to be,” said Amy K. Lehr, the director of the Human Rights Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And that could be considered forced labor under international law.” Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.']","A Times video investigation identified Chinese companies using a contentious labor program for Uighurs to satisfy demand for P.P.E., some of which ended up in the United States and other countries."
German Arts Advocate Kidnapped in Baghdad,2020-07-21,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Kidnappers in two vehicles seized a German arts advocate at dusk on Monday as she was leaving her office near one of Baghdad’s busiest thoroughfares, Iraqi security officials said. The advocate, Hella Mewis, was a well-known figure in the neighborhood, home to the Beit Tarkib Arts Center, which she had established with Iraqi artists to encourage and showcase their work. Ms. Mewis was also active last fall in supporting anti-government protesters, whose ranks included many intellectuals and artists. Scores of anti-government protesters were kidnapped during the demonstrations last fall and winter, which the United Nations human rights division documented in a recent report, suggesting that armed groups operating outside of government control were responsible. Originally from Berlin, Ms. Mewis went to Iraq in 2010 with the Goethe Institute, an organization that promotes German language and culture around the world, according to an article in the journal International Politics. Ms. Mewis, 45, said she was impressed by the deep interest that young Iraqis had in the arts. “In Europe the art scene is saturated, everything has been done before,” she was quoted as saying, “but I can make a difference in Iraq.” Her openness and energy attracted a number of young Iraqis into the arts and she made many friends, said Thekra Sarsam, who runs a nongovernmental organization in Baghdad. “Her Tarkib organization always supported the youth protests, and their voice and artistic work was always supportive of the demonstrations,” Ms. Sarsam said. Artists covered the walls of central Baghdad and the area around Tahrir Square with protest murals last fall that combined art and politics, often with a dose of humor. “I got in touch with her more than a week ago,” Ms. Sarsam added, “and she was concerned after the assassination of Hisham al-Hashimi.” Mr. al-Hashimi, a security analyst and researcher on Iraqi armed groups, was killed on July 7. Like Ms. Mewis, he supported the protesters who started the anti-corruption demonstrations in October. Ms. Sarsam said she and Ms. Mewis had discussed security conditions in the wake of Mr. al-Hashimi’s killing. “I said the situation is not good, and everyone is under threat,” Ms. Sarsam recalled. Ms. Mewis frequently rode her bicycle to and from the Beit Tarkib Arts Center in the Karada neighborhood, a mixed area of Shiites, Sunnis and Christians. The German Foreign Ministry confirmed that Ms. Mewis had been taken and said that it had set up a crisis unit to help respond. Iraqi security forces also set up a team to search for her and the abductors, said Gen. Saad Maan, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. “Hella is a dear friend of ours and earned the respect and appreciation of many Iraqis; she has worked a lot for Iraq,” General Maan said. Iraqi human rights advocates condemned the kidnapping. “Hella Mewis’s kidnapping is a serious indication of the inability of the Iraqi government and security forces to protect foreign nationals in Iraq who provide continuous humanitarian and cultural services to the Iraqi people, who need them most, “ said Ali al-Bayati, a member of the High Commission for Human Rights in Iraq. Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']","Hella Mewis started an arts center in the Iraqi capital, and supported anti-government protesters last fall. It was not clear who abducted her."
"Once a Model City, Hong Kong Grapples With a New Coronavirus Wave",2020-07-20,By Javier C. Hernández and Tiffany May,"['Hong Kong once seemed like a model for how to control the coronavirus. Schools were open. Restaurants and malls buzzed with crowds. Buses and trains operated as usual, with residents dutifully wearing face masks on board. But a new wave of infections in recent days has put the city on edge. Hospitals are now seeing more cases a day than they ever have during the pandemic. More important, health officials are unable to determine the origin of many of these cases, despite having a robust contact tracing system in place. The government reported 73 cases on Monday, one of the highest totals for a single day since the coronavirus emerged nearly seven months ago in mainland China. In short order, the virus has spread across the city, infecting clerical staff at a government-run eye clinic, residents at a senior center and cleaning workers at the airport. “The situation is very serious, and there is no sign of it coming under control,” Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said on Sunday as she announced new restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. As governments around the world look to relax rules put in place to combat the virus, Hong Kong’s experience provides a cautionary tale. Lifting social-distancing restrictions too swiftly, experts say, can open the door to fresh outbreaks. And with a vaccine still many months away, they say, even the most vigilant countries are susceptible to sudden surges in cases. China, Japan, South Korea and Australia are all grappling with outbreaks of the virus. “It’s really, really alarming,” David Hui, the director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said of the recent outbreak. “Once you loosen the restrictions too much, you face a rebound.” The city had been widely praised by international experts for its response to the pandemic. It moved quickly to tighten its borders and impose quarantine rules, containing outbreaks traced first to travelers from mainland China and then to Hong Kong residents returning from Europe and the United States. But the latest outbreak has puzzled top health experts. Officials have so far been unable to trace how a significant number of people caught the virus, a worrisome sign, epidemiologists say, that makes it more difficult to break the chain of transmission. Most people who tested positive for the virus have not traveled and have not been linked to known clusters. Dr. Hui said that previous outbreaks in Hong Kong were effectively contained before they could spread in the community unchecked. “You could just isolate close contacts, quarantine them and stop the outbreak,” he said. This time, he said, “it’s quite difficult because we had a lot of silent transmission that has entered Hong Kong already.” Many residents have attributed the outbreak to people who have entered Hong Kong recently without undergoing the standard 14-day quarantine. They have urged the government to stop granting exemptions to some business travelers and airplane pilots, but the government, which is struggling with a recession, has defended the exemptions as necessary. After easing restrictions on daily life in recent weeks, Hong Kong officials are once again imposing tough measures aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Masks are required indoors in public spaces, and dining at restaurants after 6 p.m. is banned. The government has ordered gyms, movie theaters and swimming pools to close once again. About 40 percent of government workers have been asked to stay home. Chuang Shuk-kwan, a top health official, did not rule out the possibility of imposing a curfew or a lockdown if the number of cases grew exponentially. “Of course, we hope the situation wouldn’t reach that stage,” Dr. Chuang said at a news conference on Monday. The government is expanding its testing of residents, especially of those considered to be at a high risk of contracting the virus, including older adults, taxi drivers and restaurant workers. Officials say they are processing about 10,000 tests a day, and health workers have distributed testing kits in residential compounds where clusters have emerged. Medical workers say they worry that an influx of coronavirus patients could overwhelm the city’s crowded hospitals. Health officials said on Monday that 71 percent of the 1,700 beds in isolation wards in the city’s hospitals were already in use. Most coronavirus patients, however, are in stable condition, with only 36 considered to be seriously or critically ill. A dozen people have died from the virus during the pandemic. Adding to the strain, many isolation wards in Hong Kong are crowded with young patients who show no symptoms of the virus but are required to stay until they test negative. Doctors worry this could lead to a lack of space for older patients or those with more severe symptoms who need urgent medical attention. Mrs. Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, said Sunday that the authorities were planning to use some 300 beds at a resort to isolate patients with mild symptoms. The government has said it would build a large quarantine center by the end of the year to accommodate 2,000 people, which could help ease overcrowding if cases rise again later in the year when the temperature drops. As hospitals move swiftly to convert facilities to treat only people with the coronavirus, a further surge in such cases could leave patients with other conditions suffering, experts said. Arisina Ma, the president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors Association, said some patients with other conditions have waited months for procedures and might not be able to seek treatment if coronavirus cases continue to rise. “We have quarantine facilities, but the stress on our hospital services is still tremendous,” she said. “It seems our health care system has been paralyzed by Covid.”']","Doctors are seeing more cases a day than they had in previous outbreaks, and a number of infections with unknown origin have made the outbreak harder to contain."
Republicans Begin New Relief Talks as Hopes Fade for Rapid Recovery,2020-07-20,,"['Follow our live updates of coronavirus cases and deaths globally. With the failure by the United States to control of the coronavirus clouding hopes for a rapid economic rebound, Republicans gathered in Washington on Monday to begin discussing their opening proposal for the next federal stimulus bill. The talks got underway as the virus spreads rapidly in wide areas of the country, forcing some state and local officials to shut some businesses again. Unemployment remains stubbornly high after a spring that saw record numbers of Americans sign up for food stamps. And many leading business leaders are steeling themselves for a prolonged disruption. Some of the items being discussed have a special urgency for the nation’s millions of unemployed workers: expanded benefits of an additional $600 per week are set to expire at the end of this month, and the parties remain far apart on whether to extend them. The top two congressional Republicans, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, met with President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the White House on Monday to try to smooth over their differences. Congressional Republicans were infuriated when the administration moved over the weekend to block billions of dollars that Republicans had included in their draft proposal for testing and tracing efforts and to fund federal health agencies. People familiar with the deliberations said that Senate Republican leaders and Trump administration officials had coalesced around a $1 trillion total price tag for the bill, which Mr. McConnell hopes to release this week, but that its final contents were still very much in flux. The bill is an opening bid from the Republican side, and its overall cost is almost certain to grow in negotiations with Democrats, who have called for significant aid to help state and local governments avert massive layoffs of public employees amid plunging tax revenues. Ideas set to be presented to senators during Republican lunches on Tuesday break the $1 trillion package into three buckets. One would appropriate additional aid to small businesses. A second would give money to schools and hospitals. The third would include an estimated $400 billion for a new round of stimulus checks to individuals, a scaled-back extension of expanded unemployment benefits, tax breaks for small businesses and some version of the payroll tax holiday that Mr. Trump has pushed for. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Monday sketched out his views on what should be included in the relief package, emphasizing the need to help families and small businesses as well as to provide funds to help schools reopen in a safe manner. “With the president having turned his back on the problem, people are looking to Congress for the support they need to keep their heads above water,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. The statement also said that “not one penny” should go toward tax cuts for the richest Americans. And Congress, Mr. Biden said, should require that relief for businesses not be used to outsource jobs. He also said the next aid package should include funds to prevent layoffs of teachers and help schools with reopening safely, along with additional aid to help states and local governments. (On Friday, Mr. Biden released a plan for safely reopening schools.) Even as the outbreak has worsened in many states, Mr. Trump has been pressuring schools to reopen for in-person instruction in the fall, and has threatened to withhold federal funding from the growing number of school districts opting for remote learning instead. It remains unclear how school funding will be structured in the Republican proposal, with some Republicans in support of giving more money to schools that are reopening, but reluctant to penalize those who have not done so. One person familiar with the discussions said that funding levels would most likely allocate around $70 billion to elementary and secondary schools, with at least $20 billion set aside for colleges and universities, though the person cautioned that the funding had not yet been finalized. After nearly five days of intense haggling, European Union leaders stepped up early on Tuesday to confront one of the gravest challenges in the bloc’s history, agreeing to a landmark spending package to rescue their economies from the ravages of the pandemic. The 750 billion euro ($857 billion) stimulus agreement, spearheaded by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France, sent a strong signal of solidarity even as it exposed deep new fault lines in a bloc reshaped by the British exit. The deal was notable for its firsts: European countries will raise large sums by selling bonds collectively, rather than individually; and much of that money will be handed out to member nations hit hardest by the pandemic as grants that do not have to be repaid, and not as loans that would swell their national debts. Those extraordinary steps reflected a difficult consensus: that the scale of crisis facing the member states required groundbreaking measures to ensure the bloc’s legitimacy, stability and prosperity. But the lengthy negotiations in Brussels were notable, too, for their exceptional rancor — and it was clear that the pooling of resources and sovereignty had come at a cost. Teachers’ unions sued Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida on Monday over his administration’s emergency order pushing schools to fully reopen next month even as coronavirus cases in the state are surging. The suit, which appears to be the first of its kind across the country, sets up a confrontation between unions and politicians that could change the trajectory of school reopening over the coming weeks. In other parts of the country, including California and parts of Texas, many large school districts have concluded in recent days that it is not safe to hold in-person classes. But Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, has been pushing for things to be different in Florida, which is home to five of the country’s 10 largest districts. Earlier this month, Mr. DeSantis’s administration ordered schools across the state to reopen five days a week starting in August. His edict came as President Trump called for schools to reopen nationwide and threatened to cut federal funding for districts that did not teach in person. The American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second-largest teachers’ union, and its local affiliate, the Florida Education Association, accused Mr. DeSantis of violating a Florida law requiring that schools be “safe” and “secure.” (An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the A.F.T. as the nation’s largest union.) The unions, along with parent and teacher plaintiffs, asked a state court in Miami to block the governor’s reopening order and allow local school superintendents and health departments to have full control over reopening decisions. Mr. DeSantis distanced himself from the executive order on Monday, noting at a news conference that it had been issued by the state’s department of education, not by him. “You know, they have a board and they do different things,” he said. The order was signed by Richard Corcoran, the state’s commissioner of education, a former speaker of the Florida House who was tapped for the position by Mr. DeSantis when he was governor-elect and who was officially appointed by the board. But Mr. DeSantis has urged schools to reopen for in-person instruction. “If fast food and Walmart and Home Depot — and I do all that so I’m not, like, looking down on it — but if all that is essential, then educating our kids is absolutely essential,” Mr. DeSantis said this month. “And they have been put to the back of the line in some respects.” On Monday, Florida became the eighth state where at least 5,000 people with the virus have died after it added a daily tally of 90 deaths. The state also added 10,347 cases. Public health experts have said districts should consider reopening only if they are in a region with a positive test rate at or below 5 percent. Miami-Dade County has recently reported positivity rates more than four times greater than that threshold, and the plaintiffs argue that it would be among the most dangerous places in the state to reopen schools. U.S. Roundup Mr. Trump said on Monday that he is bringing back the daily coronavirus briefings that he halted in April, a tacit acknowledgment that the public health crisis that he has sought to put behind him is still ravaging much of the country. With cases and deaths on the rise, Mr. Trump told reporters that he would probably hold the first of the new series of briefings on Tuesday at 5 p.m. He attributed his decision to revive them not to the increasing threat of the virus, but to the fact that the briefings had high television ratings. “I was doing them and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television. There’s never been anything like it,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a previously unannounced meeting with congressional Republicans. “It’s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines, with the therapeutics.” The original briefings over the course of weeks from March to April were made-for-television events, with scientific information provided by public health experts often overshadowed by a confrontational president castigating governors, lawmakers, China, reporters and others he deemed insufficiently grateful to him for his leadership. He used them to defend his administration’s response to the virus and promote a pet drug as a possible treatment over the advice of his own experts. He eventually quit holding the briefings after he was mocked widely for suggesting that people might be able to counter the virus by ingesting or injecting bleach, an offhand comment that sent public health agencies scrambling to warn the public not to try such an approach because it could be fatal.  But in recent weeks, the surge of cases, particularly in the South and West, has frustrated Mr. Trump’s effort to diminish the seriousness of the continuing pandemic. The United States now records more than twice as many cases each day as it did during the height of the daily briefings, and the number of deaths, which had fallen substantially, has begun to rise again as well. Mr. Trump, who has generally resisted wearing masks in public or strongly endorsing their use despite the advice of federal health officials and pleas from some governors, posted a picture of himself in a mask on Twitter on Monday, writing “many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance.” Even as hospitals fill up and governors reverse decisions to reopen, Mr. Trump has continued to insist that the virus would simply vanish on its own. “It’s going to disappear and I’ll be right,” Mr. Trump said in an interview aired on “Fox News Sunday” over the weekend. “Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else.” Elsewhere in the United States: Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky limited social gatherings to 10 people on Monday, a day after the state reported its highest number of new coronavirus cases. “We don’t want to become Arizona or Florida,” Mr. Beshear said. He also issued a recommendation that people returning from states with positivity rates of 15 percent or higher quarantine themselves for 14 days. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California provided a snapshot of a state in flux a week after he announced the biggest statewide rollback yet of efforts to lift restrictions on the world’s fifth largest economy. Minnesota, which on Monday reported 900 new cases, a single-day record, also reported its first virus-related death of a child, according to the state’s health department. The department said the child was 5 years old or younger, but did not list the exact age. Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago is rolling back some of the city’s reopening rules. Starting Friday, bars will once again be banned from serving alcohol indoors; services like shaves and facials that require people to take off their masks will be banned; indoor fitness classes will be limited to 10 people; and property managers will be asked to limit guests to five per unit to prevent parties. Kansas announced on Monday more than 1,000 new cases, a single-day record, while Alaska reported its own single-day record with 137 new cases. As cases spike across Florida, the virus appears to have caught up with the residents of the Villages. The Department of Health and Human Services unveiled a new dashboard on Monday with regularly-updated data on hospital capacity.  Two potential vaccines against the virus from Oxford University and the Chinese company CanSino have triggered immune responses in hundreds of humans without dangerous side effects, according to two studies published on Monday in the British medical journal The Lancet. Although short of proving efficacy at preventing infection, the results are the most promising indication yet of progress toward a vaccine that could end the pandemic. A third potential vaccine, from the American biotechnology company Moderna, has also elicited immune responses in 45 people who have received it, according to a study released last week. All three potential vaccines are moving into larger tests, known as Phase III trials, aiming to show their effectiveness at preventing the diseases. The Oxford vaccine, which is being produced in partnership with the British-Swedish drug giant AstraZeneca, is already in large Phase III tests in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, where more than 10,000 participants have already received doses. (An earlier version of this article described AstraZeneca incorrectly as a British-Swiss company.) Another Phase III test involving 30,000 participants in the United States is set to begin next week, along with a parallel test of the Moderna vaccine. The CanSino vaccine has also passed safety tests and is heading for an efficacy trial in Brazil. Exactly when any of those tests may deliver results remains hazy. “Seeing these responses means that people should be optimistic that this vaccine will be useful,” said Prof. Adrian Hill of Oxford, one of the scientists developing the vaccine. “But there is no guarantee until you have shown efficacy in humans because you can’t know what you don’t know.” GLOBAL ROUNDUP Hong Kong once seemed like a model for how to control the virus. But a new wave of infections in recent days, peaking at 108 new cases on Sunday, has put the city on edge. Hospitals are now seeing more cases a day than they ever have during the pandemic. More important, health officials are unable to determine the origin of many of these cases, despite having a robust contact tracing system. As governments around the world look to relax rules put in place to combat the virus, Hong Kong’s experience provides a cautionary tale. In other pandemic related developments around the world: The World Health Organization expressed alarm on Monday over the growing number of cases among Indigenous communities throughout the Americas. As of July 6, more than 70,000 cases have been reported among them, and more than 2,000 deaths. Indigenous communities in both urban and remote areas are at risk, said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.’s director general. India announced a record 40,000 cases on Monday. Tati, the discount department store in Paris more visited than the Eiffel Tower, is shutting. The pandemic has dealt the store a final blow after a long decline, its owners say. Without tourists on beaches, workers in Bali are returning to farming and fishing. A small study of hospitalized virus patients in Britain has identified a promising new treatment for the illness. Synairgen, a Britain-based biotechnology company, said on Monday, with initial results showing that an inhaled form of a commonly available drug can reduce the odds of patients requiring intensive care. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said the police would arrest people for not wearing masks in public. “We have to ask our police to be more strict,” he said. “Catch them. A little shame or put them on notice forever.” Air passengers to China must provide a negative Covid-19 test result before boarding the flight, the aviation authority said. The test must be completed within five days of the trip. In yet another virus-related disruption of American education, some 1,400 high school students showed up to take the ACT college admission test on Saturday, only to discover their testing sites had been shut down, according to the ACT. The thwarted tests, at 21 locations nationally, were the latest frustration for students hoping to complete college applications in a year marred by closed campuses and rocky transitions to online instruction. Fearing the spread of a virus that continues to rage in much of the country, school districts have shut down classrooms and standardized testing companies have canceled numerous dates for the ACT and the SAT. Still, with fall deadlines for college applications drawing closer, many students had signed up for Saturday’s tests, even though many colleges had announced they would waive the use of those scores this year. In a statement on Monday, ACT Inc., the nonprofit organization that administers the test, noted that more than 88,000 students at some 1,100 sites successfully took the exam on Saturday. Test takers had been warned to check the ACT website for updates, but not all the cancellations made it onto the site, according to the statement. “We know that some sites canceled up until late Friday night, including some we were unaware of, resulting in unprocessed communications to students,” the statement said. The organization said it was still investigating what caused the unannounced cancellations. ACT said it would follow up with students to offer refunds and new opportunities for testing. Three prominent historically Black colleges and universities in Atlanta — Morehouse College, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University — said Monday that the worsening outbreak had forced them to reverse course on their plans to reopen for in-person instruction. All three announced that they would teach online-only in the coming semester, citing the rapidly deteriorating public health crisis. “It pains me deeply now to deliver the news that in the past two weeks, the health crisis has worsened considerably in the state of Georgia, the city of Atlanta, and in Fulton County, in which Spelman and the Atlanta University Center are located,” Mary Schmidt Campbell, the president of Spelman College, wrote in a letter to first-year students, announcing that instruction this fall would be virtual. The president of Morehouse, David A. Thomas, noted in a letter explaining the decision that there were only 20 known cases in Fulton County, where the college is, in March when students were sent home — but “now, there are more than 12,000.” And the president of Clark Atlanta University, George T. French Jr., noted that since the end of June, when he announced plans to welcome freshmen and sophomores back to campus, “the number of Covid-19 cases has increased exponentially.” SPORTS AND CULTURE ROUNDUP On Monday, rookies from the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans became the first of thousands of N.F.L. players to report to training camp. The league’s insistence on sticking to the pledge to start its season on time comes as cases are rising in dozens of states, including California, Florida and Texas, which together are home to eight N.F.L. teams. The owners and the N.F.L. Players Association have worked for months to find ways to bring players back together as safely as possible. On Monday, the league and the union agreed on daily player testing for the virus for at least the first two weeks of training camp. Some of the league’s biggest stars — including Patrick Mahomes and J.J. Watt — had started a social media campaign using the hashtag #WeWantToPlay as part of their efforts. In other sports and culture developments: Major League Baseball will start its shortened season this week, but there will be no fans in the stands. The Washington Nationals announced that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci — the nation’s top infectious disease expert — will throw out the ceremonial first pitch on Thursday, which is opening day. Warner Bros. announced on Monday that it was abandoning its release date for Christopher Nolan’s film “Tenet” of Aug. 12, the one-time marker for when Hollywood hoped moviegoing would return in earnest. None of the 346 N.B.A. players tested for the coronavirus over the past week have returned “confirmed” positive tests, the league announced Monday. The next major step for the N.B.A. arrives Wednesday, when four scrimmages will be played to enable the league to start staging games. The California Interscholastic Federation announced that high school sports will not begin until December or January. The federation said in a news release that it was regularly monitoring the guidance of organizations including the state Department of Public Health and local county health departments — agencies that its member school districts follow “with student health and safety at the forefront.” The usually tourist-packed Berkshires confronts a season without Tanglewood, the music festival that anchors its summers. When Google and Apple announced plans in April for free software to help alert people of their possible exposure to the virus, the companies promoted it as “privacy preserving” and said it would not track users’ locations. Encouraged by those guarantees, Germany, Switzerland and other countries used the code to develop national virus alert apps that have been downloaded more than 20 million times. But for the apps to work on smartphones with Google’s Android operating system — the most popular in the world — users must first turn on the device location setting, which enables GPS and may allow Google to determine their locations. Some government officials seemed surprised that Google could detect Android users’ locations while Switzerland said it had been pushing Google to alter the location setting requirement. Some Android users in Europe also said they felt misled by their governments. Pete Voss, a Google spokesman, said the virus alert apps that use the company’s software do not use device location. The apps use Bluetooth scanning signals to detect smartphones that come into close contact with one another — without needing to know the devices’ locations at all. The Android location requirement underscores a troubling power imbalance between governments and two tech giants that dominate the mobile market, some security and privacy experts said. As New York City entered a limited fourth phase of reopening on Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo threatened to roll back the reopening of city bars and restaurants after a weekend that saw crowds partying outside in Astoria in Queens and elsewhere. If lax local enforcement of social distancing and open-container laws continued, Mr. Cuomo said, he would step in, adding that his warning applied to parts of Long Island and upstate New York, too. Mr. Cuomo’s warning came as New York City became the last part of the state to move into Phase 4, which allows some outdoor institutions like zoos and botanical gardens to reopen, with limits. Concerns about the threat of another outbreak moved officials to maintain the ban in the city on indoor businesses that have been allowed elsewhere in the state: gyms, malls, movie theaters, museums and indoor dining. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that the city did not have “a set timeline” on when these indoor activities could resume, or a deadline on a decision. Gatherings of up to 50 people are now allowed in the city, as well as indoor events at houses of worship operating at one-third of maximum capacity. Outdoor film production and professional sports without audiences can also resume.

Partyers Clash With German Police,2020-07-19,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — Violence erupted overnight in Frankfurt between police officers and youths who have been partying in a central city square on weekends, with bars and clubs shuttered to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. It was the latest outbreak of violence involving the German police amid a national debate on bias and racial profiling in police ranks. “The mood turned against us,” Frankfurt’s police chief, Gerhard Bereswill, said Sunday at a news conference, adding that members of the crowd had fought with police officers. “Certain groups feel encouraged — above all when they have been drinking — to attack police,” he added. The violence in Frankfurt comes weeks after hundreds of young men clashed with the police and vandalized dozens of stores in Stuttgart. Coverage of the protests in the United States against police brutality and systemic racism has received widespread attention across Germany, encouraging immigrant groups here to speak up against what they say are years of being stopped by officers at random, based solely on their appearance or skin color. Police in Germany have long been widely respected by a majority of the public, but have come under sharper criticism and more frequent attacks since the protests that have swept the United States. Asked what he thought was behind the violence, Chief Bereswill said several elements had come together, including an aggressive mood fueled by alcohol, but also the public debate in Germany over racial profiling by police in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by an officer in Minneapolis in May. At least some of the 39 people initially detained in the melee came from a “migrant background,” the police said, without offering further details. “The accusation of racial profiling that is very present in society right now,” he said, adding that the issue of police violence in the United States “has spilled over to Germany and the German police are falsely being compared to the U.S. police.” “All of that came together and we feel that on the streets,” he said in an interview with Hessische Rundfunk public television. Last week, Horst Seehofer, Germany’s top security official, rejected calls for his ministry to conduct a study into structural racism among the country’s police officers, insisting that he saw no indications among the federal force that racial profiling was a problem. Instead, he said his ministry would follow through on an investigation of extremism and racism in the public sector that had already been commissioned. “For weeks, the police have been under strong criticism, and I would like to see us return to a fact-based discussion,” Mr. Seehofer told the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. “To do this, we need an overview of extremism, anti-Semitism and racism in the whole of the public sector.” Opernplatz, the square outside Frankfurt’s opera house, where violence broke out overnight, has become the scene of regular weekend parties this summer, with thousands of people gathering around a fountain to socialize, drink and dance. About 3,000 people were there on Saturday night, a racially mixed crowd of diverse ages and economic backgrounds. The celebrations remained largely peaceful until about 3 a.m. Sunday, when a fight broke out among about two dozen revelers still in the square, Chief Bereswill said. When a group of 10 officers moved in to give first aid to an injured person, some in the crowd turned on them and began pelting them with bottles and glasses. Others cheered as the glass flew, he said, and five officers were injured. The Frankfurt police said that eight of the 39 people who were detained remained in custody on Sunday. The authorities in Frankfurt are investigating those eight, all aged 17 to 21, on suspicion of attacking officers and vandalizing public property. A video published on the website of the local radio station FFH showed a crowd roaring approval when a man wielding a trash can succeeded in smashing the glass at a bus stop at the edge of the square. The city authorities had set up hundreds of temporary trash cans and portable toilets to prevent the pileup of empty bottles and other trash left on the square in recent weeks. “Our Opera Square is dedicated to ‘The True Beautiful Good,’” Omid Nouripour, a lawmaker for the Greens who grew up in Frankfurt, wrote on Twitter. “Not idiots who injure police, vandalize bus stations and destroy everything for peaceful revelers.”']",Tensions are running high in the country amid a national debate on racial profiling in police ranks.
"New Treatment for Covid-19 Shows Promise, but Scientists Urge Caution",2020-07-20,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — A British drug company said Monday that an inhaled form of a commonly used medicine could slash the odds of Covid-19 patients becoming severely ill, a sliver of good news in the race to find treatments that was met by scientists with equal measures of caution and cheer. The drug, based on interferon beta, a protein naturally produced by the body to orchestrate its response to viruses, has become the focus of intensifying efforts in Britain, China and the United States to treat Covid-19 patients. Scientists have found that the coronavirus attacks the body in part by blocking its natural interferon response, disarming cells that would otherwise be alerting neighboring cells to activate their own genes and fortify themselves against the invading virus. In theory, administering interferon to patients could invigorate its defenses in the early stages of illness. But giving patients interferon without eliciting serious side effects has proved challenging. The symptoms of a seasonal flu, for example, are largely produced by the mobilization of the body’s interferon response, scientists said. The British drug company, Synairgen, tried to circumvent that problem by developing an inhaled form of interferon that directly targets cells in the lungs, rather than an injection, which can produce more intense side effects. It conducted a small, double-blind trial on patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in nine British hospitals. The initial results, announced in a brief news release but not yet peer reviewed or published, were promising: The inhaled form of interferon beta tested by Synairgen was shown to reduce the odds of hospitalized patients becoming severely ill — needing ventilation, for example — by 79 percent compared with patients who received a placebo. But the significance of the findings was seriously limited — and, in the view of some scientists, undercut — by the small size of the trial. It involved only 101 patients, Synairgen said, making it difficult to know for certain how beneficial the drug was or how it affected patients differently. The study could not rule out that the drug was only marginally effective. The company also fell short of the number of patients it originally said in a filing on a U.S. government website that it intended to enroll. That raised concerns among scientists that the company had analyzed the results earlier than it should have, once the treatment appeared to be effective. They said a much larger randomized trial was needed before they could assess the drug. Scientists also noted that while injectable interferon has historically been used to treat hepatitis infections, the inhaled form of treatment was not yet licensed or widely available. Still, amid a crisis caused by a disease with no known cure, the results were tantalizing. If the finding is borne out, it may represent one of the most significant breakthroughs to date in treating Covid-19 patients, virologists said. “If there is the material to distribute it to the population, and you could keep the price down, this could absolutely be a game changer,” said Benjamin tenOever, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “I don’t doubt it will work. I just don’t know how feasible it is.” Professor tenOever was a co-author of a study in May in Cell, a scientific journal, about how the virus blocks the body’s interferon response. He said evidence was piling up that administering interferon could help limit the replication of the virus, especially in the early stages of illness, fending the virus off for long enough that a second set of genes could successfully eradicate it. In hamsters, Professor tenOever said, there were signs that interferon cleared the virus and blocked onward transmission. In China, the early results of a study among medical workers also showed promise, concluding that interferon nasal drops “may effectively prevent Covid-19 in medical staff.” The study found that the drops “have potential promise for protecting susceptible healthy people during the coronavirus pandemic.” Among the most pressing challenges for British and American researchers studying interferon is the difficulty in recruiting patients in places where caseloads have fallen.  Professor tenOever said one clinical trial planned at Mount Sinai had to be scuppered after coronavirus beds emptied out. Synairgen, whose share price soared after it announced the results on Monday, is now struggling to recruit Covid-19 patients who are at home. Stuart Neil, a professor of virology at King’s College London, said there had been fears early  in the pandemic that giving interferon to patients could worsen the over-aggressive immune response that was itself sickening some of them. But more recent findings have indicated that, in fact, infected patients mount a limited interferon response on their own. That insight has laid the groundwork for studies like Synairgen’s. “It’s very exciting,” Professor Neil said. “By basically inhaling the interferon into the site of infection, it looks like you’re taking the edge off the virus.” Synairgen said that over the two-week treatment period, patients receiving the interferon beta drug were twice as likely as patients who received a placebo to recover to the point where they were no longer limited by their illness. The company also said that breathlessness was lower in patients receiving the drug. But the sparsely detailed news release announcing the findings left many questions unanswered. Among other concerns, scientists noted that the company was mostly reporting outcomes over the course of a two-week treatment period only. They warned that things  could change later. Synairgen, founded by researchers at the University of Southampton in southern England, said that as a listed company, it was obligated by stock market rules to report the early results of its trial. The company said that it had originally developed the inhaled form of interferon for patients who are especially susceptible to seasonal colds and the flu, among them people with asthma and with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. “We have recognized that as a broad spectrum antiviral, it could always have a place if an unwanted, highly pathogenic virus emerged,” Richard Marsden, the chief executive of Synairgen, told reporters on Monday. He said the company would work with regulators to make progress on the development of the drug as quickly as possible. Scientists believe the interferon drug will work most effectively on patients who are not yet seriously ill. By contrast, another drug, dexamethasone, has been shown to help more severely ill patients. Dexamethasone is already being used at American and British hospitals to treat coronavirus patients, doctors have said, and the World Health Organization called for accelerating production to ensure an adequate supply. But the initial reports by scientists of the benefits of dexamethasone also showed the hazards of conducting science by news release. When the full study about dexamethasone was posted online — after doctors had already begun prescribing it — it reported that while the drug seems to help patients in dire condition, it might be risky for patients with milder illness.']","A small study of an inhaled form of a commonly available drug, interferon beta, suggests it could reduce the odds of patients becoming severely ill."
At Least 60 Migrants Killed in Turkish Boat Disaster,2020-07-20,By The New York Times,"['ISTANBUL — Turkish rescue teams have retrieved the bodies of 60 migrants after their boat sank in a lake in the east of the country, Turkish media reported on Monday, in one of the worst disasters involving migrants in Turkey in recent years. The boat capsized late at night on June 27 with as many as 80 people on board, and the confirmed death toll has climbed steadily since then. At least two children were reported to be among the dead. The accident occurred on Lake Van, a large inland lake in eastern Turkey, near the border with Iran. The migrants were crossing the lake on a fishing boat in an apparent attempt to avoid police checkpoints on the highways, on their journey toward western Turkey. Early reports indicated some of the dead may have been Afghans and Pakistanis. Families from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran have started reaching out for information, said Mahmut Kacan, a lawyer who heads the migrant committee at the Van Bar Association. For more than a year, migration officials have been reporting unusually large numbers of people crossing undocumented into Turkey and trying to reach Europe, warning that the figures are creeping back toward the levels seen at the height of the migration crisis in 2015. Turkey apprehended 60,000 illegal migrants last year, double the number in 2018. The numbers kept climbing early this year, then fell in April and May, when the country was largely under lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, and only authorized motorists were allowed on the roads. But as the lockdown was lifted in June, the numbers began to rise again. Turkey’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said more than 4,500 migrants had been apprehended already this year in the eastern Van region, and thousands more had been stopped at the border with Iran. Most came from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and African countries, he said earlier this month. The Turkish Coast Guard reported intercepting more than 9,000 illegal migrants at sea in the first three months of this year — nearly three times as many as the same period last year. In January alone, 4,000 migrants were found, compared with 1,000 in January 2019. “People are still trying, and they always will whether there is a pandemic or not,” said Lanna Walsh, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration in Turkey. But even as the flow of people into Turkey grows, the number of migrants crossing from there into Europe has fallen dramatically, largely thanks to aggressive pushbacks by Greece. In the first six months of this year, 11,900 illegal crossings by migrants were detected in the eastern Mediterranean region, barely half the number detected in the same period last year, Frontex, the European border and coast guard agency, reported last week. Only 200 were detected in June, one of the lowest totals recorded for that month since 2009. There were 70 to 80 people aboard the ill-fated boat on Lake Van, according to a statement given to the military police by one of the men accused of trying to ferry them across the water. The statement, attributed to Medeni Akbas and seen in written form by The New York Times, said the group included one or two children and five or six women. Mr. Akbas is the only survivor found so far. A relative of his, Servet Akbas, is still among the missing. Mr. Akbas has been arrested, along with four others, and arrest warrants have been issued for 17 more people. His statement says his relative asked him to join him in smuggling the migrants across the lake, and offered him $110 to mind the boat’s engine and help if fights broke out among the passengers. His relative was steering the boat when a wave hit it from the side and overturned it, throwing half the passengers into the water and trapping others under the hull, he said. He held on to one of the migrant’s bags and managed to stay afloat until the early hours of the next day. Servet Akbas was with him in the water but died, and Medeni Akbas said he could not hold on to his body and had to let him go. He called his family when he reached the shore. Thirteen bodies were found in the lake soon after the accident, before the wreckage was located. Since then, Turkish officials have been using a submersible device to retrieve bodies from the wreck, which is lying at a depth of about 350 feet, the Demiroren news agency reported. Twenty-five of the dead are Afghan, according to an Afghan embassy official, the BBC reported. The lawyer in Van, Mr. Kacan, said that families in touch with him had given him names of people thought to be on the boat. “So far names of nine refugees were transmitted to us,’’ he said by telephone. “We will be presenting them to the prosecutor’s office.” Van province has long been known as a crossing point for refugees from Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Mr. Kacan said that recently a small number of African migrants have been using the same routes. Known for its harsh winter season, it sometimes features in the news when bodies of migrants emerge on the mountains as the snows melt in the spring. Seven migrants drowned in a similar accident last December on the lake, Mr. Kacan said. “That’s how we learned about this route,’’ he said. “When we talk to locals, fishermen, we understand that this has been done for a long time and the law enforcement has been just looking the other way.”']","Rescuers continue to pull the bodies of victims from Lake Van, in eastern Turkey, more than three weeks after the fishing boat carrying them sank."
Trial Begins in Germany Over Synagogue Attack on Yom Kippur,2020-07-21,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — A young German man charged with killing two people last fall after his plan to blast his way into a synagogue filled with Jews observing Yom Kippur failed, told a court on Tuesday that he was inspired by the white supremacist who had killed 51 worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand earlier last year. Stephan Balliet, 28, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of a 40-year-old woman, who spoke up as Mr. Balliet planted explosives around the entrance to the synagogue in the eastern city of Halle, and a 20-year-old man he thought was a Muslim. He is also charged with 68 counts of attempted murder and other crimes for the attack last Oct. 9. If convicted of murder, Mr. Balliet faces life in prison. The attack raised alarm that even Germany, a country that prides itself on its culture of humility and atonement for the crimes of the Nazis, is not immune to the international influence of far-right extremism and white supremacy that has incited rampages from New Zealand, to Pittsburgh. In 2019, crimes against Jews in Germany reached their highest level since the country started tracking them in 2001. Mr. Balliet was flown to the courtroom in Magdeburg hours before the trial opened. He wore a protective vest and jeans, and his hands and feet were in handcuffs and shackles similar to those of defendants who’ve faced terrorism charges. The trial had been moved from a smaller court in Naumburg to accommodate all of the participants and the news media. Dressed all in black, his face largely expressionless, Mr. Balliet at first gave only curt responses when the presiding judge, Ursula Mertens, pressed him for details about his past, his family and his personal life, German media reported. “That’s not important,” he responded again and again. What was important to him was the year 2015, when Germany welcomed more than one million refugees. He said that was when he decided to turn his back on a society he described as “infiltrated” by Muslims and Black people, whom he used a racist slur to describe, eliciting a rebuke from Judge Mertens. “I will not accept the verbal abuse of people in this courtroom and have the authority to remove you,” she told him. “I will not tolerate further crimes in the courtroom by you slandering people.” The racist slurs and derogatory language Mr. Balliet repeatedly sought to use echoed the hateful rants denouncing feminists and immigrants heard on a video he made of his attack using a camera mounted on a helmet. He broadcast his remarks live to an online chat platform. In the 35-minute video, which Mr. Balliet said was inspired by the New Zealand massacres that were also livestreamed by the perpetrator, he declared, “The root of all these problems is the Jew.” Kai Lohse, a federal prosecutor, confirmed that Mr. Balliet blamed Jews for the problems he identified in German society. “He described Jews as rats that had to be lured out of the synagogue” to be killed, Mr. Lohse told the court. Prosecutors have found no indication the attacker was part of a larger network beyond the virtual world where he drew inspiration. Mr. Balliet largely confessed, in the courtroom and earlier to prosecutors, to the charges against him, including the two counts of murder. His only remorse, he said, was that both people he killed were white. The death of the woman, identified only as Jana L., in keeping with German privacy laws, was “not planned or wanted,” he said, but when she made a remark that upset him, he had no choice but to shoot her. “If I hadn’t done that, everyone would have laughed at me,” he said, explaining that because he was livestreaming the attack, those watching would have realized that “a stupid comment is enough to stop someone from the Right.” His intent, though, had been to empty his weapons inside the synagogue, he said. When he was thwarted by its heavy oak doors, he headed for a kebab shop and opened fire. “Someone was standing in the door and I shot him,” he told the court, adding that he had thought the man he killed, identified only as Kevin S., was “Middle Eastern.” Dozens of the 52 people who had gathered for services in Halle’s Humboldt Street Synagogue last year on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, were among those who packed the courtroom on Tuesday. In a statement released by their lawyer before the trial began, they expressed hope that the proceedings would draw attention to the role the internet plays in fueling far-right hatred and the links between anti-Semitism and other forms of hatred. “The perpetrator chose his targets on the basis of a white, racist ideology that fuses anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, sexism and xenophobia with conspiracy theories,” they said. “His radicalization took place in online communities that strengthened and promoted these beliefs.” In June last year, a conservative politician who supported refugees, Walter Lübcke, was fatally shot just outside his home in western Germany, in the country’s first far-right political assassination since the Nazi era. Security forces then revealed that Mr. Lübcke was one of many people on a neo-Nazi hit list. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has since declared far-right extremism the “biggest security threat facing Germany,” and promised a beefed-up security response. However, minority rights activists and opposition leaders accuse the authorities of being too quick to write off individuals like Mr. Balliet as lone actors with no connection to the societies in which they live. “He did not simply radicalize out of nowhere,” Cem Ozdimir, a lawmaker for the opposition Greens, told n-tv television on Tuesday, adding that most extremists are men who are marked by misogyny, as well as hatred of Jews and Muslims. “It is important that the whole of society stands up,” he said, “and says we want to chase this hate back into hell, where it came from.”']",A 28-year-old racist is charged with murdering two people in an assault that raised alarm about the spread of right-wing extremism online.
U.K. Suspends Extradition Treaty With Hong Kong Over Security Law,2020-07-20,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — In an escalation of tensions with China, Britain on Monday suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong to protest a new security law that gives China sweeping powers and is seen by critics as imperiling basic freedoms in the former British colony. The move, announced in Parliament by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was prompted directly by fears that anyone extradited to Hong Kong from Britain could be sent on to mainland China with ease. Mr. Raab also announced an extension to Hong Kong of a longstanding arms embargo against China that has been in force since 1989. Both measures underscore a hardening stance among British politicians — across the political spectrum — over China’s treatment of Hong Kong, a former colony that returned to Chinese control in 1997, and growing worries about more assertive behavior by Beijing on the global stage. The announcement came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain prepared to welcome Mike Pompeo, the United States secretary of state, to London for a two-day visit. China is expected to be high on the agenda, and consensus on a tough posture looks likely. Hours before Mr. Pompeo was scheduled to arrive in Britain, Mr. Raab told lawmakers that the extradition treaty would be suspended immediately and indefinitely, and would not be reintroduced “unless and until there are clear safeguards.” “The U.K. is watching and the whole world is watching,” Mr. Raab added. The extension to Hong Kong of the arms embargo, Mr. Raab said, would include the ban of potentially lethal weapons, their components or ammunition, or “any equipment — not already banned — which might be used for internal repression.” Shackles, intercept equipment, firearms and smoke grenades would be covered by the embargo, Mr. Raab added, describing the British move as part of a proportionate response to China’s failure to observe its international obligations. The measures were met with condemnation in China. Asked about the issue, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Wang Wenbin, urged Britain to “stop going further down the wrong path.” Britain is one of a growing number of countries to have denounced the security law in Hong Kong, which was introduced after months of pro-democracy demonstrations. It suddenly transformed the city by effectively criminalizing an array of political activity, including many of the tactics used by protesters. But Britain has special concerns and sees the new law as a breach of the terms of a joint declaration that set out the semiautonomous status of Hong Kong after the colony was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In response, the government in London has offered a pathway to citizenship for many Hong Kong residents. Under that measure, 350,000 people who hold British National (Overseas) passports — and an additional 2.5 million who are eligible for them — would be granted 12-month renewable visas that would allow them to work in Britain with the possibility of eventual citizenship. Chinese anger over that move deepened last week when the British government reversed a decision to allow Huawei, a Chinese technology company, to play a limited role in establishing Britain’s 5G high-speed wireless network. The United States has pressured Britain to exclude Huawei and, through its own measures against the Chinese technology firm, forced the British government to reconsider its initial decision to allow Huawei to participate in the British 5G network. Now British 5G providers will not be able to buy Huawei products after the end of the year, and will have to remove the company’s technology completely by 2027. Mr. Raab’s statement on the extradition law and arms embargo was widely welcomed in Parliament, an indication of how far sentiment on China has shifted recently. It was also widely hailed across ideological divides, with a growing consensus on the need for toughness. Lisa Nandy, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party, called on the government to go further and apply sanctions against senior Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses. That underscored the more hawkish stance of a Labour Party whose new leader, Keir Starmer, has tried to strike a very different tone from his left-wing predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The transformation is just as striking within Mr. Johnson’s ruling Conservative Party. Under previous governments led by David Cameron, who was prime minister between 2010 and 2016, Britain pursued what a former chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called a “golden era” in relations with China. Chinese investment was courted, and China became a player in some sensitive sectors, including Britain’s nuclear power program. But discontent among Conservative lawmakers has been rumbling since Mr. Johnson’s initial decision in January to allow Huawei into Britain’s 5G network. Internal opposition was one reason for Mr. Johnson’s policy reversal on Huawei last week. The discord has grown because of China’s increased pressure on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, its early response to the coronavirus, and its overall human rights record. On Sunday China’s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, dismissed accusations of abuse against the country’s Uighur minority, despite being confronted in a BBC interview with images that appeared to show blindfolded Uighurs waiting to be loaded onto trains. Mr. Xiaoming suggested that the video footage was “fake” and accused Western nations of making repeated “false allegations” against China. Few British politicians are convinced. In Parliament on Monday one Conservative lawmaker and former minister, Tobias Ellwood, questioned whether this might be a “turning point where we drop our pretense that China shares our values,” and called for a strategic overhaul of foreign policy in relation to China. That hardened sentiment is reflected in the growing influence of a new caucus, the China Research Group, that draws support from a range of opinion within the Conservative Party. Chris Patten, Britain’s last governor of Hong Kong and a former Conservative Party cabinet minister, described Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, as a “dictator,” and said that China “under its communist leadership, can’t be trusted.” “Right across the board China has been picking a fight with anybody who passes by,” said Mr. Patten, citing tensions between Beijing and countries ranging from India and Japan to Australia to Canada. Mr. Xi had managed to unite in opposition both wings of a British Conservative Party that was divided over Brexit, just as he had done “across the board in American politics,” Mr. Patten said. “They have gone out of their way to behave loutishly, “ Mr. Patten added, “and I don’t think it is surprising that right across the board, politically, in this country politicians have seen the real nature of Chinese communism in the 21st century.” Claire Fu contributed research from Beijing.']","Several foreign governments have criticized the new law, which gives China broad powers to crack down on political crimes in the territory."
Kuwait Says 91-Year-Old Emir Had ‘Successful’ Surgery,2020-07-19,By The Associated Press,"['DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The 91-year-old emir of Kuwait underwent a “successful” surgery on Sunday that required the crown prince of the oil-rich nation to be temporarily empowered to serve in his place, its state-run news agency reported. Kuwait has yet to explain why the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, needed to seek a previously unannounced medical treatment beginning Saturday. However, Sheikh Sabah’s sudden surgery could renew a power struggle within Kuwait’s ruling family. The state-run KUNA news agency had described Sheikh Sabah’s hospitalization on Saturday as “medical checks,” citing a statement from the country’s royal court. Several hours later, KUNA published a second report saying that the 83-year-old crown prince, Nawaf Al al-Ahmad al-Sabah, had assumed some of Sheikh Sabah’s powers temporarily, without explaining why that was necessary. But a copy of the ministerial decree posted by Kuwait’s official gazette, Kuwait Al-Youm, and seen by The Associated Press on Sunday said the crown prince would be empowered for “the duration of a surgical procedure until the health event is over.” The decree did not elaborate. Kuwait’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though minutes later the state-run KUNA news agency reported Sheikh Sabah underwent a “successful” surgery, without elaborating. “May God bless his highness and grant him a speedy recovery,” the KUNA report said, citing a royal court statement. Sheikh Sabah, a widely beloved ruler, took power in 2006 just nine days into the rule of the ailing Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah. Concerns mounted during Sheikh Saad’s brief reign as he was seen in public only in a wheelchair and did not speak. However, Sheikh Sabah’s ascension upset an informal power-sharing arrangement between branches of Kuwait’s ruling family. The country has since remained politically stable with the most-empowered parliament of any Gulf Arab nation, but there have been internal power struggles behind the scenes of his rule. Kuwait, a nation of 4.1 million people, has the world’s sixth-largest known oil reserves. It has been a staunch U.S. ally since the 1991 Gulf War expelled the occupying Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein. Today, Kuwait hosts some 13,500 American troops, many at Camp Arifjan south of Kuwait City, which is also home to the forward command of U.S. Army Central.']","No further explanation was given for the procedure, which could renew a power struggle in the Gulf nation’s ruling family."
E.U. Adopts Groundbreaking Stimulus to Fight Coronavirus Recession,2020-07-21,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — After nearly five days of intense haggling, European Union leaders early on Tuesday stepped up to confront one of the gravest challenges in the bloc’s history, agreeing to a landmark spending package to rescue their economies from the ravages of the pandemic. The 750 billion euro ($857 billion) stimulus agreement, spearheaded by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France, sent a strong signal of solidarity even as it exposed deep new fault lines in a bloc reshaped by Britain’s exit. The deal was notable for its firsts: European countries will raise large sums by selling bonds collectively, rather than individually; and much of that money will be handed out to member nations hit hardest by the pandemic as grants that do not have to be repaid, and not as loans that would swell their national debts. Those extraordinary steps reflected a difficult consensus among members: that the scale of the crisis facing them required groundbreaking measures to ensure the bloc’s legitimacy, stability and prosperity. “Europe has shown it is able to break new ground in a special situation. Exceptional situations require exceptional measures,” Ms. Merkel said in a news conference at dawn. “A very special construct of 27 countries of different backgrounds is actually able to act together, and it has proven it.” But the lengthy negotiations in Brussels were notable, too, for their exceptional rancor — and it was clear that the pooling of resources and sovereignty had come at a cost. A strange kind of political theater, never visited upon European Union summits before, marked the meeting — with leaders donning masks and bumping elbows to greet. They were safely spaced in a vast hall, their entourages trimmed to only the most essential members. When they convened on Friday, it was their first in-person summit in the five months since the coronavirus took hold in Europe. The meeting was officially scheduled to last until Saturday. By Monday morning, exhausted and angry after bargaining all night, they were still tussling over the details. The start of Monday’s session was twice delayed, and then it spilled into Tuesday morning. As negotiations broke down over the weekend, so did many precautions the leaders and their teams had taken to protect themselves from the virus, which in most of Europe has been brought down to manageable levels, in any case. As the hours wore on and the talks grew heated, the diplomatic gloves came off, and so did the masks. Breakout groups met in rooms far smaller and less ventilated than the 300-seat auditorium where the general meeting was convened. While there is no underestimating the importance of the agreement — the generosity of its size and the novelty of its mechanisms — the acrimony and dramatics of the four-day meeting betrayed the new divisions within the bloc. They also signaled where the fractures may lie in future crises. The talks were defined by shifting roles among members now jostling to make their voices heard and for leadership in the absence of Britain, which had often played the part of the thrifty contrarian, fastidious about rules, in past summits. This time, Ms. Merkel, unusually for a German leader, and holding the E.U.’s rotating presidency, put her finger on the scale on behalf of hard-hit southern countries and did battle with the nations she once championed, the northern members that have been less affected by the virus and are wary of the vast sums being thrown around. Where Friday’s meeting was marked by joyful greetings and even celebrations of the birthdays of two leaders — Ms. Merkel, now 66, and Prime Minister Antonio Costa of Portugal, who turned 59 — Sunday night’s dinner (a “cold dish” after several sumptuous meals, socially spaced but unmasked) was marked by shouting matches and a nasty atmosphere. Mr. Macron, for example, yelled at Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria for not only being a tightfisted impediment to the rescue deal but also for leaving the room to take a call. To some leaders’ shock, the French president slapped the table. Mr. Kurz tried to keep his cool, and in a zinger put Mr. Macron’s temper tantrum down to sleep deprivation, diplomats said. As that meeting broke up without a deal around 6 a.m. Monday, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told his country’s media that he didn’t care if other leaders mockingly called him “Mr. No” for blocking the agreement. (They did.) “We’re here because everyone is taking care of their own country, not to go to each other’s birthdays for the rest of our lives,” he said bluntly. It was Mr. Rutte who stepped into the vacuum left by Germany’s shift and Britain’s departure to lead the so-called Frugal Four, which includes his nation as well as Austria, Sweden and Denmark. Occasionally, the “frugals” became five with the support of Finland. In the end, with a unanimous decision by the 27 nations needed for a plan to go forward, a bitter compromise prevailed. The ambitious plan pushed by Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron was watered down, but remained significant. The overall figure of €750 billion remained, but an original proposal to offer €500 billion of that in the form of grants was trimmed back to €390 billion, with €360 billion earmarked for loans. In addition to raising cash and extending grants, the package will increase lending and deploy other, more traditional stimulus methods to arrest and reverse the economic free-fall that threatens the stability of the world’s richest bloc of nations. Economists predict a recession far worse than anything since World War II. France, Italy and Spain, the bloc’s second-, third- and fourth-largest economies, are expected to suffer the most, clocking in contractions of around 10 percent this year. Greece and other smaller economies that are still recovering from the last recession will also be badly affected by the downturn. But heavy debt loads in many of these nations make them reluctant to amass yet more debt, and their budgets aren’t sufficient to self-fund their recoveries. That led them to turn to the European Union for help. Together with the vast bond-buying program by the European Central Bank, national stimulus plans worth trillions of euros, and other, smaller E.U. support schemes for banks, businesses and workers, European leaders hope to reverse the recession in 2021 and spend their way into a rapid and powerful recovery. They also agreed on Tuesday on the bloc’s regular budget for the next seven years: €1.1 trillion euros to finance the normal E.U. policies on agriculture, migration and hundreds of other programs. But the deal came at a heavy price in progressive goals attached to E.U. values and norms. To bring Hungary and Poland on board, E.U. leaders decided to water down the caveat making funding conditional on the rule-of- law benchmarks that the two nations’ illiberal governments are violating. In another concession to Poland, the bloc’s most coal-dependent nation, a requirement was dropped that would have committed the country to being carbon neutral by 2050 to draw on parts of the funds. Since its inception, the E.U. has struggled between maintaining nation-state sovereignty and developing joint federal-style structures. The deal reached on Tuesday is significant in that more creditworthy E.U. nations will be underwriting loans to fund the recoveries of countries that would otherwise face onerous borrowing costs. The Netherlands and Austria were hostile to the very idea of borrowing money and simply giving much of it to benefit mostly southern, weaker economies. Under significant pressure at home as elections approach next March, the Dutch prime minister, Mr. Rutte, advocated loudly for fewer handouts to those nations, among them Italy and Spain, that have been hardest hit by the pandemic but that also have structurally weak, unreformed economies. The Netherlands and other wealthier nations with healthier public finances are concerned that the commonly funded aid would simply go into a bottomless pit of spending that doesn’t truly help these economies recover without changes to make it easier to reduce bureaucracy, create jobs and stimulate growth. A key argument in favor of offering grants rather than loans has been that Italy and other countries likely to take the aid are already over-indebted, and piling on yet more loans would just worsen their positions. Mr. Rutte fought successfully for bigger-than-usual rebates, or reimbursements, for his own and other nations that are net contributors to the E.U. budget. He and the others succeeded in wringing out another concession: Any country that wishes to use the new funds will need to submit a plan for how it intends to spend the money. The other E.U. nations will have a chance to review and object to the plan within three days of its submission and demand that it be tweaked. Still, that mechanism fell short of the outright veto that Mr. Rutte had demanded, which the Italian and Spanish leaders denounced as an unacceptable encroachment into their authority. The package will go to the European Parliament for ratification, and is expected to face a serious challenge on the grounds that it does not tackle concerns about how Poland and Hungary’s governments violate the bloc’s standards for democracy and the rule of law.

3 Dead After Glacier Tour Bus Rolls Over in Canadian Rockies,2020-07-19,By Ian Austen,"['OTTAWA — A popular tourist outing in the Rocky Mountains in Alberta turned into a scene of chaos after a glacier tour bus rolled on Saturday afternoon, killing three passengers and injuring 24 others on board, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Cpl. Leigh Drinkwater of the mounted police said that the driver of the specially designed ice bus was among the survivors, although he had no knowledge of that person’s condition. Alberta health services said that 14 people had been taken to hospitals in “critical, life-threatening condition.” The bus, which has oversize tires for driving on ice and similarly oversize sightseeing windows, was climbing a rocky, steep road to the Columbia Icefields in Jasper National Park when it plunged down an embankment, Corporal Drinkwater said. A photograph from a bystander posted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation showed the red and white bus badly damaged and resting on its roof on rocky moraine. It was not immediately known why the bus toppled over. Emergency workers from a variety of agencies descended on the ice field shortly after the accident. At least one helicopter contracted out by Parks Canada, the federal parks agency, was used to lift the dead and injured from the crash site to five air ambulances up on the ice field or road ambulances down below on a nearby parkway. The injured tourists were being treated in three nearby cities. Tanya Otis, a spokeswoman for Pursuit, the company that operates tours of the ice fields, said the incident involved one of its special, all-terrain buses that allow visitors to walk on the glacier. The ice fields are a major international tourist attraction and are part of the Athabasca Glacier, one of the largest in the Rockies, and it feeds three major water systems in Western Canada. While Parks Canada has said that the ice field has been melting for about 125 years, climate change has accelerated that process. One witness said on Twitter that he was stuck with several other passenger on another “ice explorer” bus that was forced to stop after the incident The man wrote that he saw the other bus lose “control and roll over.” Rob Kanty, who witnessed the rollover after finishing an earlier bus tour, said in an email that it appeared the bus had encountered a rock slide, although he said it was uncertain what role that had played in the crash. He added that the buses did not have seatbelts. Corporal Drinkwater said that investigators had ruled out any criminal intent in the crash.']","The vehicle, with 27 people on board, was specially designed to carry visitors onto one of North America’s largest glaciers, in Jasper National Park in Alberta."
Officer Details Killing of Police Partner in Trial of Americans in Rome,2020-07-21,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The long-awaited appearance in court of Andrea Varriale, a crucial witness in a murder case against two young American men accused of killing an Italian law enforcement officer last year, played out in a Rome courtroom this month. Three tension-filled days of sworn testimony shed some light on how a night of routine police work ended in tragedy, in a case that hinges on one fact: whether the two defendants were aware that the witness and his partner were plainclothes officers when they approached the Americans on an empty street corner before dawn. Officer Varriale and his partner that night, Deputy Brig. Mario Cerciello Rega, engaged in a brief scuffle with the two Americans, who had been vacationing in Rome, while on a patrol shift in the early hours of July 26, 2019. Brigadier Cerciello Rega was repeatedly stabbed with a knife, and the two Americans — Finnegan Elder, now 20, and Gabriel Natale Hjorth, now 19 — are on trial, accused of his murder. They had been vacationing in Rome, and they have admitted to killing the officer. The case has attracted significant media attention in Italy and the United States, in part because of the youth of those involved. Brigadier Cerciello Rega, 35, was a member of the Carabinieri, Italy’s national military police force, and newly married. His death stunned Italians at a time when the country was being run by a center-right coalition that stoked fears — without evidence — that the nation was being racked by violent crimes mostly committed by foreigners. Proceedings reopened to the news media this month after a one-month halt and three months of closed-door hearings because of coronavirus restrictions. Rome’s courthouse remains closed to the public. The encounter between the American teenagers and the officers had been set up to swap a backpack the teenagers had stolen earlier. Prosecutors say the teenagers attacked the officers to avoid arrest, while the defense argues that the Americans acted in self-defense, believing the plainclothes officers to be ill-intentioned thugs. On the stand, Officer Varriale testified that he and his partner had clearly identified themselves as Carabinieri as they approached the teenagers. He said he pulled out his wallet, flipped it open to show his badge, then tucked it into the rear pocket of his jeans so he could move closer, empty-handed. A fight immediately ensued, and he began rolling around on the ground with Mr. Natale Hjorth, “clumsily,” he said. Then, he said, “I heard Mario scream, ‘Stop, stop, Carabinieri,’ with a voice that wasn’t his own,” so he let the teenager go and attended to his partner. Prosecutors played the anguished telephone call Officer Varriale made for an ambulance as Brigadier Cerciello Rega lay dying. His widow, Rosa Maria Ersilia, wept, clutching a laminated photo of her dead husband in uniform. The emotion was too much for Ms. Ersilia’s father, Mario, who collapsed and had to be taken to a hospital last week, abruptly ending that day’s proceedings. The death of Brigadier Cerciello Rega was the last act of a convoluted drama that began in a trendy Rome neighborhood full of nightclubs where the two Americans had gone to buy drugs earlier in the evening. The teenagers were sold an aspirin substitute instead of cocaine, and they grabbed the backpack of Sergio Brugiatelli, the Roman who had acted as a middleman in the deal, demanding money and cocaine for its return. The officer died during an operation to recover the backpack. Over two full days on the stand, defense lawyers pointed to inconsistencies in Officer Varriale’s earlier depositions and critiqued actions they said were inappropriate. Mr. Natale Hjorth was at one point blindfolded and handcuffed while he was detained, raising accusations of unlawful treatment. Officer Varriale made a video of Mr. Natale Hjorth in that moment, asking the defendant several questions, but he said in court that he had not wanted to interrogate him. He admitted that treating a detained person in such a way “seemed strange,” but he said many of his superiors were in the room, so he didn’t think there was cause to intervene. The jury also heard that when he was first interrogated in the days after the crime, Officer Varriale told his superiors that he and the brigadier had brought their guns with them that night, a detail that was later found to be false. He is currently on trial in a military court for not carrying his service weapon. On the stand, he said that he had made a mistake in lying to his superiors, calling the decision “thoughtless” and “foolish.” “It was my decision that night” to go out without a gun, one he had not repeated since, he said Monday. But Officer Varriale said his memory failed him when the defense questioned him on other details, including calls placed to and from his cellphone on the night of the crime. Those calls went to two off-duty Carabinieri officers who had been tailing Mr. Elder, Mr. Natale Hjorth and Mr. Brugiatelli for an hour, believing a drug deal was about to go down. As interpreters whispered translations, both defendants sat silently throughout the procedures while their lawyers butted heads with prosecutors and Mr. Varriale’s lawyer. Tempers occasionally flared. Ms. Ersilia, the brigadier’s widow, sat quietly a few rows behind them with other family members. Commemorations were planned this week in Rome and Somma Vesuviana, Brigadier Cerciello Rega’s hometown, to mark the anniversary of his death. On July 13, a two-story poster appeared on a palazzo next to the street corner where he was stabbed to commemorate what would have been his 36th birthday and the 206th anniversary of the foundation of the Carabinieri, in 1814. Next to a smiling photo of Brigadier Cerciello Rega, an inscription read: “‘I’ll send you a kiss with the wind and I know that you’ll feel it.’ Your wife.”']",The killing of Deputy Brig. Mario Cerciello Rega last year has attracted significant media attention in Italy and the United States.
‘A Place Where Everybody Can Shop’ Is Closing Its Doors,2020-07-20,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Tati is a ghost of what it once was, and soon it won’t even be that. Shelves that were crammed with dish-scrubbers and brassieres for $1.50 and plaster figurines of smiling bunnies are now bare. Exits are still numbered — how else to find your way out through the crowds — but the aisles are empty. There are no crowds. It’s as though the discount department store, a once-thronged wonder of Paris more visited than the Eiffel Tower, is willing itself out of existence, fading like a Cheshire cat’s smile back into the hinterlands on both sides of the Mediterranean where many of its famous pink gingham shopping bags ended up. The official end, in any case, is not far-off for Tati, which revolutionized postwar shopping in France and stamped its identity on the entire vibrant neighborhood of Barbès, on the edge of Montmartre. Tati is a victim of Covid-19, its latest owners say, and sharply declining sales. But the trends that have killed it go back much further. The great bales of 50-cent stockings and dollar underwear that once crowded the sidewalks in front of the store, on the Boulevard de Rochechouart, are no longer enough. Bargain-basement shoppers have long since had more socially enhancing options among the international chains. “Bring me your little thieves!” Tati’s founder, Jules Ouaki, a Jewish immigrant from Tunisia who had fought for the Free French in World War II, used to tell the press, a sly nod to both his humble clientele and the raffish immigrant district of Barbès that he transformed. Both made him rich. His success was once studied in French business schools. The vicissitudes of the Ouaki family — the bankruptcies, the failed ventures into high fashion by Mr. Ouaki’s son, his rock bands, horses and coauthorship of a book with the Dalai Lama — were covered over the years by the French media like episodes of “Dallas.” Now Tati, named by Jules Ouaki after his Tunisian mother, is losing money fast. The last Tati store in France, the Barbès flagship, will be gone by the end of the year. But despite its problems, it still fills a niche and will be missed. “Even people on the dole could shop here,” said Alger Djemila, clutching the vaunted gingham as she emerged one day last week from the annex off Boulevard de Rochechouart. “Equality, for everybody,” said her friend Moana Ndjassiri, who works in an Air France lounge at the airport. “This is a place where everybody can shop. You never leave with your hands empty.” So infused is Barbès with the spirit of Tati that residents and the few shoppers left have trouble imagining the neighborhood without it, after over 70 years of fruitful coexistence. “Without Tati, Barbès is dead,” proclaimed Nawel Bahiti, another shopper. “When Tati closes, the whole neighborhood will shut down,” insisted Bernard Le Huerou, a retiree who had ridden up on his bike. These are exaggerations: This rambunctious mix of Algiers, Dakar and Paris at the foot of tourist-dominated Montmartre is unkillable. But at the very least the neighborhood over which Mr. Ouaki ruled for decades “like a customary prince,” as L’Express put it in a 1980 profile, will be changed, just as he himself changed it. Newsreels from the 1970s show him beaming over the jostling elbow-to-elbow shoppers, few of them, at that time, immigrants. Now, “the entire neighborhood will be disfigured,” said Odette Osmanovic, a retiree who had come to commiserate at Tati’s doorstep last week with a fellow Barbès resident. “Thanks to the presence of Tati, Barbès itself, today, seems almost like a brand name,” wrote Emmanuelle Lallement, a University of Paris anthropologist who has closely studied the intimate relationship between the two. She has focused on how much of what surrounds Tati — the Barbès culture of street vendors hawking foodstuffs and clothing — appears as an extension of the store, and inspired by it. Even today the first thing you see off the metro, from the elevated platform at Barbès-Rochechouart station, is the giant old “Tati, The Lowest Prices” sign on top of its central seven-story Haussmann-style building, a former cafe transformed by Mr. Ouaki. The sign dominates the meek towers of Sacré-Coeur church in the near distance, commerce taking precedence over the sacred. After the war, shopping in France still inhabited a 19th-century world; if you entered a store, you generally had to buy something. Often you had to ring a bell to enter. It was an intimidating experience. Mr. Ouaki democratized it, reinventing shopping for a postwar generation of French eager to buy but limited in means. He put enormous bales of discount clothing out on the sidewalks of Barbès. The customers were free to rummage through them, feel the merchandise, not even enter the store. “He got rid of the door, and the window,” Ms. Lallement said. On the boulevard, Tati extends nearly a full block, incorporating the old bordellos and hotels that Mr. Ouaki gradually bought up, going from the 150 square feet he started with in 1948, to over 9,000 square feet of shopping space by the 1980s. “He changed it from a nighttime to a daytime district,” said Ms. Lallement, and for his efforts was awarded the Légion d’Honneur, France’s highest civil distinction. By the early 1980s, Tati was drawing 25 million customers a year and had expanded all over France. Specially chartered buses would come up from the provinces for day shopping trips. “We had half the population of France that shopped with us,” said Hubert Assous, the former chief executive of Tati, now retired in Israel, who married into the family. “It was complete madness, for sales. When we opened in the provinces, we would be taken by storm.” When the sons took over after Mr. Ouaki’s death from cancer in 1983, “they didn’t adapt to the times,” Mr. Assous said. “Nothing was anticipated. We were navigating from day to day.” A succession of failed ventures and expansions — Russia, South Africa, Fifth Avenue in New York, jewelry, a travel agency, high fashion — failed to pan out. “No longer cheap but chic,” Fabien Ouaki, Jules Ouaki’s son, insisted was the new mantra for the store. It was a fatal miscalculation, and the company was sold in receivership in 2004. Subsequent owners failed to invest, said the workers’ union and Mr. Assous. The company that owns the store now, the GPG Group, said sales dropped 60 percent between October and May. “The store must close, for good,” it said in a news release. When the store closes, 34 people will lose their jobs, a union official said. For the remaining customers, it is one more unwelcome transformation at a time when too many are afoot. There is a kind of disbelief. “No, no,” said Sabrina Miloua, a customer toting the gingham. “This is too good here. They sell stuff, you can afford it.” “We bought all of our dishes here,” she said. “All the clothing for the children.” “Everything, everything,” her friend, Ms. Bahiti, said. Théophile Larcher contributed reporting.']",The famed department store Tati is shutting. And a lot of people are very sad.
"Despite Masks’ Proven Value, Some U.S. Leaders Avoid Mandates",2020-07-19,,"['[Follow our live Covid-19 news and updates.] As caseloads surge in many states, especially in the West and South, the debate over mask mandates continues, though evidence of their benefits has mounted substantially in recent months. President Trump, who first wore a mask in public on July 11, said in a Fox News interview with Chris Wallace broadcast on Sunday that he was a “believer” in masks, but that he would not support a nationwide mask mandate: “I leave it up to the governors.” The consistent message from the White House that virus restrictions be made at the local level has led to a patchwork of policies. More than half the states have issued mask requirements, but with many Americans feeling that mask orders impinge on individual freedom, some governors are holding out. The issue dominated talk shows on Sunday. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes for Health, called the politicization of face coverings “bizarre” in an interview on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” “Our best chance is for all of us to get together and do the right thing, and stop fighting so much about the divide between different political perspectives, which is just getting in the way,” Dr. Collins said. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado defended his decision to issue a statewide mask mandate that took effect Friday. New cases have been rising for a month, nearing the tallies during the peak of Colorado’s crisis in April, though deaths remain far lower. Mr. Polis, a Democrat, said on the ABC program “This Week” that it “was a really easy decision” after he saw data suggesting that local mask orders in his state were tied to lower case numbers. Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi said that he would not issue a statewide mask order, even though cases and hospitalizations were soaring. “If I believed that was the best way to save lives in my state, I would have done it a long time ago,” Mr. Reeves, a Republican, said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” He said he preferred a “surgical approach,” with precautions varying county by county. In Georgia, the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has sued the Democratic mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, over virus policies in Atlanta that include a mask order. On the CBS program “Face the Nation,” she called the lawsuit “a blame game.” On the ABC program “This Week,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican, said he would not support a national mandate, though he issued a state ordinance on Thursday. He said he had waited because a mask mandate was “not popular” in his state. Arkansas has been averaging more than 660 cases daily, which is near the state’s peak level, according to a New York Times database. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, said on “Meet the Press” that his state was heading in the “wrong direction” and that he would not rule out a mask order. While single-day tallies for new cases in Ohio averaged around 400 a month ago, they peaked on Friday, with 1,679 cases. Representative Donna E. Shalala of Florida, a Democrat who was formerly the nation’s longest-serving Secretary of Health and Human Services, called on her state’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, to issue mask and stay-at-home orders. State health officials on Sunday reported more than 10,000 new cases for the fifth consecutive day. “We need to close down in Florida,” Ms. Shalala said on “This Week.” “We’ve asked the governor to do that. We’ve even asked him to do the simplest thing: That is to require masks for everyone.” Despairing over President Trump’s failure to contain the pandemic and his refusal to promote clear public-health guidelines, prominent figures in the Republican Party have broken with the White House in recent days on how to respond to the virus. Some, concluding that the president may never play a constructive role in addressing the crisis, have decided that they must work around him, ignoring or even contradicting his pronouncements. Republican leaders have split with Mr. Trump over issues like the value of wearing a mask in public and of heeding the advice of health experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, whom the president and some aides have subjected to caustic personal criticism. They appear to be spurred by several overlapping forces, including deteriorating conditions in their states, the president’s seeming indifference to the problem, and the approach of a presidential election in which Mr. Trump is badly lagging his presumed Democratic challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the polls. Republican governors are now issuing orders that run counter to Mr. Trump’s demands. Some have been holding late-night phone calls among themselves to trade ideas and grievances; they have sought out partners in the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, who, despite echoing Mr. Trump in public, is seen by governors as being far more attentive to the disaster. “The president got bored with it,” David Carney, an adviser to the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican, said of the pandemic. His boss instead directs his requests to Mr. Pence, with whom he speaks two to three times a week, Mr. Carney said. When European health ministers met in February to discuss the novel coronavirus emerging in China, they commended their own health systems and promised to send aid to poor and developing countries. Barely a month later, the continent was overwhelmed. Officials once boastful about their preparedness were frantically trying to secure protective gear and materials for tests, as death rates soared in Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. This was not supposed to happen. Many European leaders felt so secure after the last pandemic — the 2009 swine flu — that they scaled back stockpiles of equipment and faulted medical experts for overreacting. But their pandemic plans were built on a litany of miscalculations. Though European leaders boasted of the superiority of their world-class health systems, they had weakened them with a decade of cutbacks. When Covid-19 arrived, those systems were unable to test widely enough to see the peak coming. National stockpiles of medical supplies were revealed to exist mostly on paper, consisting in large part of “just in time” contracts with manufacturers in China. European planners overlooked the fact that a pandemic could disrupt those supply chains. Britain most embodies Europe’s overconfidence. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was so certain of his country’s forecasts about the virus, records and testimony show, that he delayed locking down until two weeks after British emergency rooms began to buckle under the strain. With the number of infections doubling every three days at the time, some scientists now say that locking down a week sooner might have saved 30,000 lives. Global roundup Government health workers sent out to care for Indigenous people in Brazil appear to have been spreading the virus among them instead. More than 1,000 nurses and doctors with a health service known as Sesai, have tested positive for the virus as of early July. In at least six field offices, The New York Times found, the share of infected workers was above the Amazon region’s average of 8 percent. The health workers were dispatched with neither adequate protective equipment nor access to enough tests. Their high infection rates suggests that “there were failures in the protection of health care workers at a critical moment, affecting teams that care for a highly vulnerable population,” said Felipe Tavares of  the Federal Fluminense University. More than 15,500 Indigenous Brazilians have been confirmed infected, including at least 10,889 living in protected territories, according to Instituto Socioambiental, a Brazilian nonprofit. It is not possible to determine with certainty how many cases were introduced by health care workers. Some Indigenous people may have brought the virus into their communities after traveling to cities for supplies and emergency government aid. Illegal miners and loggers may also have exposed some communities. In a statement, Sesai said reports that health workers had exposed Indigenous people to the virus were “inconclusive.” It said its employees were outfitted with protective equipment. “All this planning and early research led to timely and efficient care that was delivered in villages,” the statement said. Several Sesai workers who spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation, described an exceptionally challenging mission marked by poor guidance, mistrust from many Indigenous communities and a scarcity of tests. Enoque Taurepang, the coordinator of the Indigenous Council of Roraima, said doctors and nurses had been set up for failure. “You can’t blame health professionals, because they didn’t have the tools necessary to act,” he said. The leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, said Sunday that the city had recorded more than 100 new cases in the past 24 hours, the most since the pandemic took hold in late January. “The situation is very serious and there is no sign of it coming under control,” Ms. Lam said. Hong Kong suspended nonessential government services and told most civil servants to work from home from this week. Turkey has suspended flights to Iran and Afghanistan in response to infections in those countries, its Transport Ministry said. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Saturday that some 25 million Iranians may have been infected, and Iran reimposed restrictions in the capital and elsewhere. The figure, from a report Mr. Rouhani cited in a televised speech, was far higher than Saturday’s official figure for infections of 271,606. Face coverings will be required in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, whenever people leave home, officials there said on Sunday, citing a recent increase in cases. The requirement will take effect on Wednesday. Violations could result in a fine of 200 Australian dollars, or roughly $140. Chinese officials are battling a growing outbreak in the far western Xinjiang region, the center of the country’s broad crackdown on predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. Thirty confirmed infections have been reported in its capital, Urumqi, since Thursday, 13 of them on Sunday; there are an additional 41 asymptomatic infections.  European Union leaders held a third day of acrimonious negotiations on Sunday, but there was no sign that a deal was imminent on a stimulus package involving more than 750 billion euros, or $840 billion. Most E.U. countries are keen to see the plan move ahead, but some, mostly from the wealthier northern part of Europe, are loath to allow the money to make up for what they see as southern Europeans’ failure to adequately protect their economies. With English hospitals operating at pandemic-reduced capacity, nearly four million people are on the National Health Service waiting list for routine hospital treatments that have been disrupted as hospitals have been forced to suspend services in favor of treating coronavirus cases. The waiting list could soar to 10 million people by the end of the year, according to the N.H.S. Confederation, which represents hospitals and other health care providers, though the service rejects that estimate. The Bahamas, one of the places where Americans could still travel, will now bar commercial flights or vessels from the United States, the country’s prime minister announced on Sunday. The government-owned airline, Bahamasair, will also cease flights to the U.S. “effective immediately,” said the prime minister, Hubert Minnis. The ban does not include commercial flights to Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, or “private international flights,” he said. Despite claiming to have no cases of Covid-19, North Korea says its scientists are developing a vaccine for the virus. In claims that cannot be verified, a propaganda website said that the vaccine’s safety had been verified through animal experiments and that it had entered a clinical trial. The reclusive nation’s public health system remains woefully underequipped, and international relief agencies have been providing test kits and other assistance to help the country fight the spread of the coronavirus. As demand for coronavirus testing surges around the nation, laboratories that process samples have backlogs that have left anxious patients waiting days — and sometimes a week or more — for their results. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, acknowledged the dangers associated with such delays in an interview on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” “The average test delay is too long,” Dr. Collins said. “That really undercuts the value of the testing, because you do the testing to find out who’s carrying the virus, and then quickly get them isolated so they don’t spread it around. And it’s very hard to make that work when there’s a long delay built in.” On the CBS program “Face the Nation,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said that “once testing is delayed more than 48 hours, it becomes not very useful.” The longer it takes for people to determine whether they’ve been infected, Dr. Gottlieb said, the more difficult it will be to curb the spread of disease and drive new-case numbers down. To speed turnaround times, Dr. Collins said, health officials are pushing for more point-of-care testing — “on the spot” assays designed to be done rapidly and easily without the need for specialized laboratory equipment or highly trained personnel. Some of these tests could be completed in a doctor’s office, or perhaps even at home, in less than an hour. Simple, speedy tests could be a boon for institutions and communities that care for large numbers of vulnerable people, like nursing homes. A handful of point-of-care tests have been approved for emergency use by the F.D.A. “We need to invest a lot of money, and the government is willing to do so, in scaling those up,” Dr. Collins said. “That’s the kind of thing that I personally, along with many others in other parts of the government, are working on night and day to try to do a better job of.” As companies across China rush to produce personal protective equipment amid the pandemic, a New York Times visual investigation has found that some of them are using Uighur labor through a contentious government-sponsored program that experts say often puts people to work against their will. Uighurs are a largely Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the Xinjiang region of northwest China. The government promotes the labor transfer program, which sends Uighurs and other ethnic minorities into factory and service jobs, as a way to reduce poverty, but quotas on the number of workers put into the labor program and the penalties faced by those who refuse to cooperate mean that participation is often coerced. Now, that labor is part of the P.P.E. supply chain. According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic. As of June 30, that number was 51. After reviewing state media reports and public records, The Times found that at least 17 of those companies participate in the labor transfer program. The companies produce equipment primarily for domestic use, but The Times identified several other companies outside Xinjiang that use Uighur labor and export globally. We traced a shipment of face masks to a medical supply company in the U.S. state of Georgia from a factory in China’s Hubei Province, where more than 100 Uighur workers had been sent. The workers are required to learn Mandarin and pledge their loyalty to China at weekly flag-raising ceremonies. Watch the full visual investigation in the video above. U.S. ROUNDUP Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said that the coronavirus was spreading in the city to the point where a new stay-at-home order would have to be issued. “We’re on the brink of that,” he said on the CNN program “State of the Union” on Sunday. He declined to be more specific about the timing or scope of a new order, except to say, “We have to be surgical, rather than a cleaver that would just shut everything down.” He said he agreed that earlier restrictions had been relaxed too quickly. “Mayors often have no control over what reopens up and doesn’t,” he said. “That’s either at a state or county level.” But he added, “It’s not just about what’s open and closed, but it’s also about what we do individually.” Los Angeles County has recorded more than 153,000 cases so far, and the spread of the virus has been quickening across Southern California. “Cases have gone up, but we also have the most aggressive testing,” the mayor. “We were the first city to offer tests to people without symptoms.” In other news around the country: Congressional leaders are puzzling over how to safely and appropriately honor Representative John Lewis of Georgia, an icon of the civil rights movement who died on Friday. Congress has honored more than 40 people by allowing their remains to lie in state under the Capitol dome, and many believe that such an honor would be fitting for Mr. Lewis. But the Capitol is closed to tourists and those allowed inside are encouraged to stay six feet apart. The Defense Department sent Navy teams to help support four medical centers in South and Southwest Texas as the virus surges there, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas announced on Sunday. The teams were dispatched to Harlingen, Del Rio, Eagle Pass and Rio Grande City. The state has recorded 71,779 new cases in the last week, bringing its total case load to over 330,000, with nearly 4,000 deaths. Officials in Louisiana reported 3,116 new cases on Sunday, exceeding the previous single-day record of 2,728 new cases, which were reported on April 2. The state did not provide any update on Saturday, which is a likely explanation for Sunday’s spike. Despite the N.F.L. having outlined return dates for in-person training in a memo sent to teams last Friday, the N.F.L. Players Association still has not agreed with the league on key safety issues, prompting some of football’s biggest names to voice their concerns on social media. “If the NFL doesn’t do their part to keep players healthy there is no football in 2020,” Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “It’s that simple. Get it done.” The Canadian government said it would not allow the Toronto Blue Jays to stage home games. The team had hoped to play at Rogers Centre beginning on July 29, as part of Major League Baseball’s plan to use all 30 of its teams’ ballparks for a shortened 60-game season, with a number of precautions including having no fans in the stands. But on Saturday, Canada’s immigration minister said repeated cross-border travel by players and staff members posed a health risk. The team will play its regular-season home games in the United States instead, most likely at its AAA minor-league affiliate’s stadium in Buffalo. As the virus spreads out across the United States, it is bearing down on places that are most vulnerable to its devastation — among them the southernmost wedge of Texas, on the border with Mexico, which is experiencing a punishing surge in infection. In the Rio Grande Valley, more than a third of families live in poverty. Up to half of residents have no health insurance. More than 60 percent are diabetic or prediabetic. The rates of obesity and heart disease are among the nation’s highest. And more than 90 percent of the population is Latino, a group that is dying from the virus at higher rates than white Americans are. “We knew that this was a time bomb,” said Dr. Adolfo Kaplan, a local critical care physician. But in the early days of the pandemic, there were few infections in the valley. Many public health officials attributed that to lockdown orders. Then in May, Gov. Greg Abbott let them expire. “We knew that if the hospital was hit, it was going to be a disaster,” said Dr. Kaplan, who works at DHR Health in Edinburg, Texas. “And that’s what we are living through.” The three facilities the hospital is using to treat patients with Covid-19 have been filled to capacity since the first week of July. At times, a dozen or more ambulances have waited outside for beds to become available. With 10,000 active infections in the region, public health officers estimate that hospitalizations could double within two weeks. “Our curve is a straight up trajectory right now,” said Sherri Abendroth, the hospital’s safety and emergency management coordinator. “There’s no flattening. There’s no relief.” Coronavirus cases in Tennessee have been rising sharply since late June, especially in and around Memphis and Nashville, where county officials are reporting hundreds of new cases a day. Both cities have been trying to tamp down outbreaks by reintroducing some restrictions, but they have run into resistance from restaurant and bar owners in the bustling nightlife districts. Across the country, crowded night spots have been cited as especially problematic settings in a pandemic, where masks just get in the way and social distancing is the opposite of what the patrons are there for. But owners have bridled at being singled out for shutdowns. In Davidson County, which includes Nashville, four bars sued the city after  bars were ordered to close through the end of July, while restaurants were allowed to stay open at 50 percent capacity.  Nashville’s mayor, John Cooper, acknowledged  that the city’s restrictions would be difficult to enforce “in a population that probably does include disease deniers.” And he said there was only so much Nashville could do when surrounding counties had much laxer restrictions. In Shelby County, which includes Memphis, bars and “limited service” restaurants were ordered to close earlier this month while others were allowed to stay open. That sparked a fight with owners who say the “limited service” distinction — applied to establishments that get less than 50 percent of their revenue from food — is arbitrary and pointless. A hearing in the case is set for Monday. The plaintiffs say the closure rule simply pushes patrons from some restaurants to others without any appreciable public health benefit. The lead plaintiff, Jeannette Comans, who owns the Blind Bear cocktail bar, said she had just rehired and trained enough employees to be almost fully staffed — including adding people at the door to check patrons’ temperatures and remind them about mask rules — when the new closure order was issued.  “They left me with no choice” but to sue, she said of health officials. “I still have to pay rent, I still have to pay business insurance. My poor employees daily are like, ‘What do we do?’ And I’m like, ‘I don’t know.’” President Trump called Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, an “alarmist” who provided faulty information in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. His remarks, in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, were the latest public criticism from a White House that appears to be mounting a coordinated effort to discredit Dr. Fauci, on the record and off, and in presidential tweets. Administration officials deny doing so. “I don’t know that he’s a leaker,” Mr. Trump said during the interview with Chris Wallace “He’s a little bit of an alarmist. That’s OK. A little bit of an alarmist.” Mr. Trump said that Dr. Fauci had been against his decision to close the borders to travelers from China in January. That is not true: While Dr. Fauci was initially opposed to the idea on the grounds that a ban would prevent medical professionals from traveling to hard-hit areas, he supported the decision by the time it was made. Mr. Trump also said that Dr. Fauci had been against Americans wearing masks. Dr. Fauci has said that he does not regret urging Americans not to wear masks in the early days of the pandemic, referencing a severe shortage of protective gear for medical professionals. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, was asked on the NBC program “Meet the Press” whether anyone at the White House had asked him to demote or fire Dr. Fauci, whose agency is under Dr. Collins’s supervision. “Nobody has asked me to do that and I find that concept unimaginable,” Dr. Collins said. In the hourlong interview on Fox, Mr. Trump, whose administration made crucial missteps in handling the virus earlier this year, made several false claims on the government’s response to the pandemic. Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the coronavirus rate in other countries was lower than in the United States because those nations did not engage in testing. When Mr. Wallace pointed out the lower case rate across the European Union, the president replied, “It’s possible that they don’t test.” When Mr. Wallace pointed out the increasing death rate in the United States, Mr. Trump replied, “It’s all too much. It shouldn’t be one case. It came from China. They should have never let it escape.” Mr. Trump said that he doubted whether Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., was correct in predicting that the pandemic would be worse this fall. “I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. “And I don’t think he knows.” He said that public health experts and the World Health Organization “got a lot wrong” in the early days of the pandemic, including a theory that the virus would abate as the weather warmed, and then reiterated his earlier claim, unsupported by science, that the virus would suddenly cease one day. “It’s going to disappear and I’ll be right,” Mr. Trump said. “Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else.” Mr. Trump threatened to pull federal funding from schools if they did not open soon. When Mr. Wallace pointed out that only a small portion of funding from the federal government goes to schools — and is mostly used to support disadvantaged and disabled children — the president replied, “Let the schools open.” Mr. Biden, who has been critical of Mr. Trump’s handling of the outbreak, said in a statement on Sunday: “In the middle of a pandemic that continues to worsen on his watch, President Trump is trying to keep money away from the public health measures that we know will keep us and our families safe. He even went on to attack the value of testing again in the same interview, perpetuating a terrible monthslong streak.” “Mr. President, your ignorance isn’t a virtue or a sign of your strength,” Mr. Biden said. “It’s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it’s costing Americans their jobs and their lives.” We’re all spending more time outdoors.

1920: Police Retaliate After Killings in Ireland,2020-07-21,By The International Herald Tribune,"['(By Special Leased Wire.) LONDON, Tuesday. — Following the shooting of Constables Craig and Burke, the cathedral town of Tuam went through a “perfect hell,” in the words of a resident, during the early hours of to-day. The police, having viewed the dead bodies of their comrades at the station, appear to have got completely out of hand. Fully armed they marched into the streets, smashed saloons, looting their contents, dragged young men out of bed and threatened to shoot them. Then they set fire to some of the most valuable properties in the township, causing damage to the extent of £100,000. Inhabitants in Panic. The inhabitants were first aroused by shooting and the explosion of hand-grenades. In a panic the women and children sought refuge in the rear of houses, many of which were subjected to a fusillade. Soldiers stationed in Tuam came on the scene but were withdrawn, their officers being heard to shout “This is not our job!” About five o’clock the firing died down, and townsmen who ventured abroad found many houses in flames. Some difficulty was experienced in getting the fire-hose to play on the burning buildings, as the water supply is cut off during the night. Strenuous work saved a great portion of the town from destruction. The Town Hall was burnt and a dozen shops were wrecked. At Cardonagh to-day the court-house was burned down. It was here that Joseph O. Doherty, Sinn Fein M.P. for North Donegal, was to be tried. The destruction of this court-house makes the third case of this kind within a fortnight. At Galway last night a band of fifty men attacked an automobile which was conveying four police officers. In the struggle which ensued, two of the officers were killed, and the others, after exhausting their ammunition, were captured and taken to Tuam. Stolen Money Returned Sinn Fein “police” have handed over £1,780 to the general manager of the Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland, that sum representing the amount recovered from moneys stolen from the company’s pay train held up by armed men at Killonan, County Limerick, in April. The money was handed in at the headquarters of the company by a priest, who also tendered a statement to the effect that the “Republic police” had traced and arrested the robbers and hand deducted £28, 10s, for expenses. The statement adds that the money was recovered at considerable risk to the police, and its return shows “that clean, straight justice to all within the Irish Republic can be expected.” — The New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 21, 1920.']","The town of Tuam was ransacked by the police, with buildings looted and set alight, in response to the shooting of two officers."
Ukraine Gunman Frees Captives After Documentary Demand Is Met,2020-07-21,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — A nearly 12-hour standoff in Ukraine between the police and an armed hostage-taker who demanded, among other things, that the country’s president publicly endorse a documentary about animal abuse ended with the man’s capture on Tuesday. After speaking by phone with the man, who was holding 13 hostages while armed with an automatic weapon and explosives, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged Ukrainians to watch the documentary. “Everybody watch the 2005 film ‘Earthlings,’” Mr. Zelensky said in a terse statement posted on Facebook. The documentary, narrated by the American actor Joaquin Phoenix, depicts animals suffering in industrial agriculture and in scientific research. Authorities identified the hostage-taker as a 44-year-old former convict, Maksim Krivosh, who used the nickname Maksim the Bad to post a manifesto and demands on Twitter. The rambling demands, including the assertion that the government was a terrorist organization, seemed not directly related to Ukraine’s turbulent internal politics, as they are usually understood, or its six-year-old war with Russian-backed separatists. “Happy day of the anti-system,” Mr. Krivosh wrote in one post. “Don’t fool yourselves.” In a video posted online he wore a black beret and cradled a shortened version of a Kalashnikov rifle. He asked that members of Parliament, ministers and leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church post messages saying, “I am a legal terrorist.” None of the 13 hostages held in a city bus through the tense ordeal were physically harmed, authorities said, though several shots were fired, leaving bullet holes in the bus windows. Mr. Krivosh specifically demanded that Mr. Zelensky endorse the “Earthlings” documentary. He also showed the documentary to his hostages on the bus, local news media reported. Videos and photographs from the scene in Lutsk, a town in northwestern Ukraine, showed police officers shooing pedestrians away from the bus. Security forces were seen taking cover behind utility poles and police cars. Residents of nearby apartment buildings were evacuated. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Zelensky had said in a statement that a man had called the police to announce that he had captured the bus. He said he would try to resolve the standoff without bloodshed. Mr. Zelensky’s endorsement of “Earthlings” could be seen as complying with a terrorist’s demand. But it also fit into what his office said was a negotiating strategy of trying, above all else, to avoid angering a heavily armed man with hostages. Mr. Zelensky, in a statement issued after the hostages were released, suggested that he didn’t mind appearing to lose face if it saved lives. “We were not fighting for ratings,” he said. “We were fighting for lives.” He deleted the post endorsing the film. Three people were released after the president and the hostage-taker spoke by phone, with the remaining hostages freed after Mr. Zelensky posted his statement about “Earthlings.” Mr. Krivosh then surrendered, the police said. It is unclear how Mr. Krivosh obtained his weapons. But in the early years of the separatist war in eastern Ukraine, volunteers in paramilitary groups did much of the fighting on the Ukrainian side. Over the years, some military weapons that they carried at the front, including automatic rifles, hand grenades and other explosives, went missing from arsenals and have been used in crimes far from the front line, including domestic violence. The spread of weapons from the war and relatively lax gun laws have meant Ukraine has a higher prevalence of guns in society than do other European nations.

Southern Europe Opens Its Doors to Tourists. Not Many Are Coming.,2020-07-19,By Raphael Minder,"['ADEJE, Spain — Music blared from a beachfront cafe along the normally bustling southwestern coast of Tenerife, the largest of Spain’s Canary Islands. But several tables sat empty, a month after a Covid-19 lockdown had ended, and the doors to many resorts remained shut. Though tourism is returning to southern Europe — stretching from Portugal to Greece — its restart has been sluggish amid new outbreaks in some countries. Bookings are down 80 percent in Italy despite government incentives. Ferries to the Greek islands are carrying well under half the load they once did. While Europeans are starting to travel more within their own countries, far fewer are venturing beyond their borders, particularly the holiday makers from Britain, Germany and other northern countries who typically journey south each year, spending billions of euros. And visitors from outside the continent are few and far between:  Just 13 countries are on the list of those considered safe by the European Union, a list that so far excludes the United States. The drag is felt acutely in tourist destinations dependent on air travel, like the Canary Islands, hundreds of miles from mainland Spain. Airlines carried 15 million visitors to the archipelago last year, but the flight capacity this month is just 30 percent of what it was a year ago. As a result, property owners in the Canary Islands have opened only about 20 percent of the tourism beds in the archipelago, according to Jorge Marichal, a Tenerife hotelier who is president of Cehat, the Spanish hotel confederation. “We are doing our best to highlight the fact that we now have almost no virus problem — but of course we cannot transport the tourists here ourselves,” Mr. Marichal said. Italy has tried to promote national tourism by issuing a so-called holiday bonus, a 150-euro voucher per Italian for lodging, up to €500 per family. Dario Franceschini, the minister of culture and tourism, told Parliament this month  that about 400,000 vouchers had been issued, worth €183 million in total. The Italian news media painted a less enthusiastic picture. The newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that only a small fraction of Italian hotels accept the vouchers. Greece, though suffering less from the pandemic than either Italy or Spain, has still seen scant evidence of a rebound in tourism. In the first 12 days of July, passenger traffic at the Athens airport was down 75 percent from a year ago, and 84 percent at the country’s 14 regional airports. Though all of the countries of southern Europe have emerged from lockdown, new outbreaks there and quarantine orders elsewhere have added hurdles. This month, Britain said that people coming from Portugal, among other countries, would be forced to quarantine on arrival, a move that essentially choked off British tourism there. And Britons have traditionally been the top visitors to the Algarve, the southern region of Portugal. Britain’s move drew fire from Augusto Santos Silva, Portugal’s foreign minister, who called it “absurd.” Still, Portugal has faced a strong uptick in coronavirus cases, including in municipalities surrounding its capital, Lisbon. Outbreaks have also occurred around major tourism hubs like Barcelona, where about three million residents were told on Friday to stay indoors to help contain the coronavirus. Carlos García Pastor, the marketing director of Logitravel Group, a Spanish travel operator that had revenue of about €800 million last year, said that his company expected earnings to drop at least 50 percent this year. The final result, he said, “will really depend on how many new outbreaks there are.” This month, hundreds of thousands of Spaniards were placed back under temporary lockdown by the regional authorities in Catalonia and Galicia after new outbreaks. Mr. García Pastor said some clients canceled their bookings as soon as they heard about the new restrictions. “Tourism is extremely reactive, for better or worse,” he said. In the Canary Islands, home to more than two million full-time residents, officials have trumpeted their strict safety measures and their low coronavirus caseload, less than 1 percent of the nation’s total. The archipelago’s hotels require guests to wear a face mask in the lobby and other indoor areas, and they limit the number of people who can lounge around their swimming pools. The protocols drew praise from Zurab Pololikashvili, the secretary general of the World Tourism Organization, an agency of the United Nations, after his visit to tourism destinations in Italy and Spain this month. That portrait of safety contrasts sharply with the picture that emerged from the Canary Islands in late January, when the archipelago recorded Spain’s first coronavirus case, a German tourist who tested positive on the island of La Gomera. Weeks later, one of the large establishments on Tenerife, the H10 Costa Adeje Palace, became the first European resort to lock down after the virus was detected among Italian guests. But as the virus rampaged across mainland Spain, the islands quickly brought their own outbreaks under control. The archipelago has reported 162 deaths, according to the latest official Spanish data, out of 28,420 victims nationwide. Travel within the Canary archipelago has continued, perhaps even encouraged a bit by the travel hurdles. Smaller islands like El Hierro that do not have an international airport have reported an influx of Canarians this summer. But across the islands the doors remain shut to many of the large resorts normally filled by international package tours. At the recently reopened Adeje Palace, some guests said they had been relocated there at the last minute by their travel agents because the hotels they had booked were still closed. “A week before leaving Germany, I wasn’t sure that this vacation could actually go ahead, but I had reached the point where I desperately needed time away from my hospital work and no longer really cared about which hotel I would stay in,” said Svetlana Arsenijevic, an anesthetist from the German city of Halle. A Swiss tourist, Anaïs Zufferey, said that she and her sister not only had to switch hotels at the last minute, they also had to set off from Zurich a day later than planned because their initial flight was canceled. “It’s a holiday that has required us to be very flexible,” Ms. Zufferey said. But their journey from Tenerife’s airport to their hotel was more than comfortable — they were the only passengers on a 50-seat shuttle bus.

Showdown on Beach in Bulgaria Balloons Into Political Crisis,2020-07-19,By Boryana Dzhambazova and Patrick Kingsley,"['SOFIA, Bulgaria — Leaked photographs of the prime minister. A police raid on the president’s office. A business tycoon’s takeover of a public beach. A looming no-confidence vote in the government. And the largest street protests in seven years. Bulgaria is gripped in a political crisis, its biggest since 2013, when sustained protests against corruption brought down a center-left government. Now demonstrators are trying to oust their right-wing successors, who face similar accusations of corruption, judicial interference and servility to wealthy businessmen. The poorest member of the European Union, nestled on the bloc’s southeastern frontier, Bulgaria is both a focus of the tussle for influence between the West and Russia, and an example of a decline in democratic standards in several parts of the continent. But it is also a specific and unusual case. In Hungary and Poland, Europe’s two most prominent victims of democratic backsliding, the governing party is driving the subversion of the democratic process. In Bulgaria, the charge is led by a wider range of actors, both inside and outside the government — including a small group of wealthy businessmen. The current unrest was set off by the revelation that a stretch of publicly owned coast had been reserved for the private use of a prominent businessman and power broker. For many, this crystallized fears that the Bulgarian state has fallen under the grip of outside influence, prompting tens of thousands to demonstrate in cities across the country. “There is this sense of having come to a fork in the road,” said Vessela Tcherneva, head of the Sofia branch of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research group. “Several things are happening at once,” Ms. Tcherneva added. “But first and foremost, there is the sense in the general public that the social contract, which rests on rules being applied equally to everyone, has been broken.” The crisis began when an opposition politician, Hristo Ivanov, filmed himself landing a boat on a nominally publicly owned stretch of the Black Sea coast. Plainclothes state security agents shoved Mr. Ivanov back into the water, illustrating how the beach is unofficially reserved for the private use of an influential politician and businessman, Ahmed Dogan. The episode drew condemnation from the country’s mainly ceremonial president, Rumen Radev, and set off a flood of protests at the influence that wealthy power brokers like Mr. Dogan exert over political life, state resources and, in this case, public land. “We wanted to expose that the whole state is serving the interests of Dogan,” Mr. Ivanov said in a telephone interview. Public outrage was quickly compounded when the police later raided the president’s offices and detained two members of the president’s staff. Protesters perceived the moves as retaliation for Mr. Radev’s criticism of Mr. Dogan. State institutions “have been captured by a group of people to serve their own interests instead of functioning independently as they should,” said Daniel Smilov, an analyst at the Center for Liberal Strategies, a political research group based in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital. The tension was exacerbated by a steady drumbeat of embarrassing and sometimes bizarre leaks about government officials, including Prime Minister Boiko Borisov. An unverified photograph recently published in the Bulgarian news media showed him half-naked and apparently sleeping beside a handgun. Another unverified image seemed to show Mr. Borisov’s bedside table stuffed with bank notes and gold bars. Mr. Borisov has confirmed that the room is his, but he has said that the gun and money are not, and that the images were manipulated. News outlets have also published a set of recordings of a man who sounds like Mr. Borisov speaking in private about state affairs. Thousands of Bulgarians have gathered since last Thursday in a central square in Sofia to chant outside Mr. Borisov’s office, calling for his resignation and that of the chief prosecutor. Last Wednesday, Mr. Borisov tried to assuage them by announcing that he was considering firing three senior government ministers. But he refused to leave his own post — leading protests to spread to other cities. “People are sick and tired of the collusion between the mafia and the state,” said Neli Trifonova, a 27-year-old online retailer who attended a protest on Monday. “We see it everywhere.” Opposition lawmakers have put forward a motion of no confidence in the government, which Parliament is scheduled to debate on Monday, though Mr. Borisov’s majority seems likely to hold. On Wednesday, Mr. Borisov’s party released a statement denying it was working under the influence of Mr. Dogan’s party, which he founded in 1990, after the collapse of communism. Mr. Dogan’s party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, is mainly supported by members of Bulgaria’s ethnic Turkish minority, and has only occasionally been a formal part of government. But the group and its leading members, like Mr. Dogan, have amassed outsize influence in Bulgaria’s politics, economy and media by consistently performing the role of political kingmakers. “In Bulgaria, you don’t have a strongman,” said Dimitar Bechev, an expert on southeast Europe at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “It’s more of an oligarchic system.” On Monday, the American Embassy issued an unusually forceful statement backing the protests. “We support the Bulgarian people,” the statement said, “as you peacefully advocate for increased faith in your democratic system and promote the rule of law in Bulgaria.” The force of the statement contrasted with the less strident tone taken by European institutions and leaders. Some colleagues from the European Parliament’s centrist grouping even issued messages of support for Mr. Dogan and his party. Though the rule of law is nominally central to the philosophy of the bloc, European leaders have consistently avoided taking too strong a stance against governments that stray from democratic standards at home. “The E.U. is a mechanism for creating consensus,” Ms. Tcherneva said. “The E.U. is not that good at confrontational situations.” Boryana Dzhambazova reported from Sofia, and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.']","Bulgaria is gripped by its worst political turmoil since 2013, leading to calls for the government to resign."
China Uses W.H.O. Inquiry to Tout Coronavirus Response,2020-07-21,By Javier C. Hernández and Amy Qin,"['Chinese officials are hailing a visit by a team of experts sent to Beijing by the World Health Organization to investigate the source of the coronavirus as evidence that the country is a responsible and transparent global power. But the investigation by the W.H.O. is likely to take many months and could face delays. For starters, there are logistical headaches. China has placed the advance team of experts who are laying the groundwork for a broader investigation under a standard 14-day quarantine, forcing them to do some of their detective work from a distance. “Obviously the arrival and quarantine of individuals and working remotely is not the ideal way to work, but we fully respect the risk-management procedures put in place,” Mike Ryan, the W.H.O.’s chief of emergency response, said at a news conference on Friday. He said it would take weeks before a full team would be able to visit China. The W.H.O.’s investigation comes as China faces intense global backlash, including from the United States, for initially downplaying and failing to contain the virus, which emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. For weeks, China had fiercely resisted demands from other nations that it allow independent investigators onto its soil to study the origin of the pathogen. Beijing has also tried to deflect blame by suggesting, without evidence, that the virus could have originated elsewhere. Now, officials are trumpeting Beijing’s response to the outbreak as a model for the world and attacking the United States for “shirking its responsibilities” in the global fight against Covid-19. The Trump administration, which has repeatedly attempted to distract from its ineffective response to the pandemic, has criticized the W.H.O.’s inquiry. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently said that he expected it to be a “completely whitewashed investigation.” With relations between China and Western countries deteriorating rapidly over military, technology, trade and human rights concerns, experts worry that Beijing will seek to limit the scope of the research so that it does not embarrass the government. “The whole political landscape is not favorable to doing an unbiased scientific investigation,” said Wang Linfa, a virologist in Singapore who took part in a similar W.H.O. study in China during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. “I feel sorry for the team members.” The Chinese government initially covered up the SARS outbreak, but Mr. Wang said it was later eager to cooperate with the international experts. This time, he said, the W.H.O.’s investigation was likely to be largely symbolic because the broader geopolitical climate could make Chinese experts unwilling to share valuable research. Chinese officials have provided little data from samples that the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention took in December at the Huanan Seafood Market, a sprawling market in Wuhan that sold game meat and live animals, where many of the first reported infections were traced. The market has since been closed and scrubbed down. The W.H.O.’s inquiry is focused on the question of how the disease jumped to humans from animals. The advance team is made up of an expert in animal health, as well as an epidemiologist. The team members, who arrived in mid-July, have not yet been identified and have not spoken publicly. Dr. Ryan said on Friday that the health organization was “very pleased with the collaboration on the ground.” He said earlier in the month that the experts would not do field investigations but would meet with Chinese officials and researchers to review the available data and outline the scope of the inquiry. For months, China and the United States have been locked in a political fight over the virus, with officials in each accusing the other of intentionally unleashing the virus on the world. Despite unfounded conspiracy theories that the virus was man-made, experts say Covid-19 is caused by a coronavirus that almost certainly originated naturally in animals, most likely bats. But they do not know where it came from, what the exact chain of transmission is and how many times the spillover to humans from animals has occurred. For a while, pangolins were thought to be a possible intermediate host. More recent analysis has shown that while they may have played a role in the development of the virus, there is no evidence that they were the immediate source. While the Chinese government has said it welcomes an inquiry, officials have not yet provided details about their own efforts to trace the origins of the virus. Research into the matter has in several cases been blocked or delayed, Chinese scientists say. Chinese officials have sought to reframe the W.H.O.’s visit as a sign of China’s confidence and strength, especially compared to the United States, making the dubious claim that China first requested it. (Countries such as Australia had pushed for such an inquiry.) Reports in the state-run news media have described the visit by the W.H.O. as a reflection of China’s “open attitude.” “It is our contribution to global public health cooperation as a responsible major country,” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said this month at a news conference. Mr. Zhao called on the United States to allow a similar investigation, even though there is no evidence the virus originated in America. He criticized the United States for moving forward with plans to withdraw from the W.H.O. over concerns that the health agency is too close to China. “The U.S. has been shirking its own responsibilities and undermining global solidarity in combating the virus by declaring its exit from the W.H.O., politicizing matters related to the pandemic and smearing others,” he said. Chinese officials and experts have continued to call on the W.H.O. to widen its analysis to include other countries. Wang Guangfa, a top government health adviser, has said that the W.H.O. should also go to Spain. Mr. Wang, speaking this month with The Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese tabloid, cited an unpublished study by researchers at the University of Barcelona that suggested the virus was present in Spain’s wastewater as early as March 2019. Independent experts have said that the study was flawed and that other lines of evidence strongly suggest the virus broke out in China late last year. Officials from the W.H.O. have said that Wuhan is the best starting point for scrutinizing the animal origin of the virus because it was where the first clusters of the outbreak emerged in humans. But they remained open to other lines of study, as well. “We have to keep an open mind,” Dr. Ryan said at a news briefing this month. “Science must stay open to all possibilities.” The W.H.O.’s research could take months, if not longer. Scientists took several years to conclude that horseshoe bats were the most likely hosts in nature for the coronavirus that caused SARS in 2002. Before that, researchers had identified masked palm civets as one of the primary intermediate hosts after the virus was identified in several civets that were being sold in markets in Guangdong. The inquiry also offers an opportunity for the W.H.O. to rehabilitate its own image. While the agency has been praised for its efforts to coordinate treatment and vaccine development, it has also been assailed for being too trusting of China and for not pushing Chinese health officials on their early missteps. The organization is dependent on its member states for information, and publicly challenging those countries could put it at risk of getting cut off from data that it needs to operate and respond quickly to outbreaks. Critics say that the W.H.O.’s kneejerk tendency to praise its member states makes it easy for governments, including China, to co-opt the agency for propaganda purposes. Yanzhong Huang, an expert on public health in China at the Council on Foreign Relations, said both China and the W.H.O. faced growing pressure for a comprehensive examination of what happened, but that it was unclear if they could deliver. He noted that it was still uncertain if the team of experts allowed to visit China would include representatives from countries that have rebuked China, including the United States and Australia, and whether they would have full access to records, sites and laboratories. “In a nutshell,” he said, “it remains unclear whether a thorough and objective investigation is possible.”']","The global health agency sent two experts to China, but it is unclear how much access they are getting. They must first complete a two-week quarantine."
"Trump, in a Departure, Says Virus Will Get Worse",2020-07-21,,"['Follow our live updates of coronavirus cases and deaths globally. President Trump abruptly departed on Tuesday from his rosy projections about the coronavirus, warning Americans from the White House briefing lectern that the illness would get worse before widespread recovery. “It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,” Mr. Trump said. “Something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.” In his first virus-focused televised news conference since late April, Mr. Trump appeared before reporters to defend his track record, which has been widely criticized for his tendency to downplay the severity of the pandemic. Appearing without Vice President Mike Pence, Dr. Deborah Birx or Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, key members of his White House coronavirus task force, Mr. Trump also implored citizens — especially young people — to wear masks. “Get a mask,” said Mr. Trump, who has been reluctant to wear them in public himself. “Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They will have an effect and we need everything we can get.” Mr. Trump’s comment urging Americans to wear masks was a stunning departure from his past comments on wearing them. In recent weeks, he has disparaged masks as unsanitary and suggested that people who wore them were making a political statement against him. Mr. Trump’s less dismissive comments about the pandemic reflected a dawning realization within his team that the virus not only is not going away but has badly damaged his standing with the public heading into the election in November. Approval of his handling of the pandemic has fallen from 51 percent in late March to 38 percent last week in polling by The Washington Post and ABC News. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee who now leads Mr. Trump by double digits, has assailed him in recent days for ignoring a devastating threat to the United States. In an interview shortly before Mr. Trump’s news conference, Dr. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said that he had not been invited to attend and defended himself against comments Mr. Trump had made in a Fox News interview Sunday, when he called him “little bit of an alarmist.” “People have their opinion about my reaction to things,” Dr. Fauci said in the interview on CNN on Tuesday afternoon. “I consider myself more of a realist than an alarmist.” At the White House, Mr. Trump detailed what he said was data that put the United States in a better position to defeat the virus than other countries dealing with the pandemic. At one point, he repeated the false claim that the United States has a lower fatality rate than “almost everywhere else in the world.” The country, according to a New York Times database, has the world’s 10th highest rate of reported deaths per 100,000 people. Mr. Trump also claimed “no governor needs anything right now,” contradicting the public accounts of a few governors. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon told PBS last night that “we need help with testing supplies and equipment” while Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland warned of testing shortages earlier on Tuesday. Asked about a tweet he sent a day earlier, in which he declared mask-wearing as “patriotic,” Mr. Trump did not explain why he often declined to wear one in public. “If you’re close to each other, if you’re in a group, I would put it on when I’m in a group,” Mr. Trump said. But he did not directly answer when asked why he had not worn a mask during a small group gathering at the Trump International Hotel in Washington the evening before, and appeared to toggle back and forth between his own feelings about mask-wearing as he spoke. “I’m getting used to the mask and the reason is, think about patriotism. Maybe it helps,” Mr. Trump said. But even as he acknowledged that the outbreak would worsen, the president continued to maintain, without evidence, that “the virus will disappear.” At least 1,120 coronavirus deaths were reported across the United States on Tuesday, the first time in July the single-day total had exceeded 1,000. With the exception of two days in late June when New Jersey and New York reported large numbers of deaths from unknown dates, Tuesday’s total was the highest since May 29, according to a New York Times database. Officials in Nevada, Oregon and Tennessee reported their highest single-day death figures yet. Public health experts have warned for weeks that deaths would trail new cases by about a month and case counts have risen substantially since mid-June, when states began lifting stay-at-home orders and reopening businesses.   Tuesday’s total was far below the single-day record of 2,752, reported on April 15 during the peak of the outbreak in New York and the Northeast.  The seven-day average of deaths in the United States reached 810 on Tuesday, up from an average of about 475 in early July, though still far below the country’s April peak. The United States military has emerged as a potential source of coronavirus transmissions both domestically and abroad, according to military and local public health officials. Over 20,000 members have contracted the virus, and the infection rate in the armed services has tripled over the past six weeks. Cases are rising the most on military bases in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas, all states that have seen surges in infections, Jennifer Steinhauer and Thomas Gibbons-Neff of The New York Times reported. At a base in Okinawa, Japan, the U.S. Marine Corps has reported nearly 100 cases, enraging local officials. And in war zones such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, already awash with untracked cases, U.S. troops have contended with outbreaks of the virus within their ranks. Domestically, local officials in Georgia’s Chattahoochee County, a sparsely populated area with high infection rates, traced the outbreaks to Fort Benning, the large training base there. And officials in California and North Carolina have also seen connections between military installations and communities. The rise of cases among a largely young population that lives in dense quarters near cities where bars and other crowded places that have been opened is unsurprising. But the increase raises questions about the military’s safety precautions as the Pentagon wrestles with both containing the virus within the ranks while also addressing logistical problems it has created, like relieving units that had been stuck overseas for longer than expected. There were 21,909 cases in the military as of Monday, compared with 7,408 on June 10, according to the Pentagon. Three service members have died since March, including a sailor on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. More than 440 service members have been hospitalized. The number of people infected with the coronavirus in different parts of the United States has been anywhere from two to 13 times higher than the reported rates for those regions, according to data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings suggest that large numbers of people who did not have symptoms or did not seek medical care may have kept the virus circulating in their communities. The study is the largest of its kind to date, although some early data was released last month. “These data continue to show that the number of people who have been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 far exceeds the number of reported cases,” Dr. Fiona Havers, the C.D.C. researcher who led the study, said in an email. “Many of these people likely had no symptoms or mild illness and may have had no idea that they were infected.” The researchers analyzed samples from people who had routine clinical tests, or were inpatients at hospitals, in 10 cities and states for evidence of prior virus infection. The team released early data for six of the sites in June, and for all 10 locations Tuesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. They also released data from later times for eight sites to the C.D.C.’s website on Tuesday. About 40 percent of infected people do not develop symptoms, but they may still pass the virus on to others. The United States now tests roughly 700,000 people a day. The new results highlight the need for much more testing to detect infection levels and contain the viral spread in parts of the country. For example, in Missouri, the prevalence of infections as of May 30 was 2.8 percent or 171,000, 13 times the reported rate of 12,956 cases, suggesting that the state missed most people with the virus who might have contributed to its outsized outbreak. In some regions, the gap between estimated infections and reported cases decreased as testing capacity and reporting improved. New York City, for example, showed a 12-fold difference between actual infections and reported cases in early April, but by early May the difference was down to tenfold. The study indicates that even the hardest-hit area in the study — New York City, where nearly one in four people has been exposed to the virus — is nowhere near achieving herd immunity, the level of exposure at which the spread of the virus would start to dwindle on its own. To reach that level, experts believe at least 60 percent of people in a particular place would have had to be exposed to the virus. U.S. ROUNDUP When millions of Americans began losing their jobs in March, the federal government stepped in with a life preserver: $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits. That life preserver will disappear within days if Congress does not act to extend it. Republican leaders labored on Tuesday to avert a party revolt over the next round of coronavirus aid, announcing that they planned to provide $105 billion for schools, direct payments to American families and more aid for struggling small businesses. Even as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, divulged details of his emerging plan, which is expected to be worth roughly $1 trillion, President Trump had yet to sign on and Republicans remained deeply divided over several key elements. Ahead of what are expected to be difficult negotiations with Democrats, Senate Republicans and White House officials were fighting over how much money to devote to testing and to the federal health agencies on the front lines of the virus response; whether to include a payroll tax cut that Mr. Trump has demanded; and how to address the expiration of the enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of the month. Top Republican officials privately cautioned that the coming negotiation was likely to stretch into August, leaving tens of millions of unemployed Americans without extra help, potentially prompting a wave of evictions and further damaging the economy. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump offered a positive assessment of the economy. “We are in a pandemic, and yet we are producing tremendous numbers of jobs,” he said during his first virus-focused news conference in weeks. “That was something nobody thought possible,” he said, later adding that he expected the next few quarters to look even better, predicting a “record year.” While it is true that nearly five million positions were brought back in June, over all the United States is still down around 14.7 million jobs since February. New York, grappling with how to prevent another large outbreak, will now require travelers from a total of 31 states to quarantine for 14 days, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Tuesday. The weekly update saw Minnesota taken off the list and the addition of 10 states: Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Virginia and Washington. New Jersey and Connecticut are also requiring travelers from those 31 states to quarantine. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut signed an executive order on Tuesday to mandate the self-isolation, with failure to comply punishable by a $1,000 fine. The top public official in hard-hit Hidalgo County, Texas, ordered residents on Monday to stay at home, imposed a curfew and implored all but essential businesses to shut down. But the order lacked any means of enforcement, a situation that has frustrated local officials across Texas. As Gov. Greg Abbott prepared to reopen the state in April, he blocked local officials from issuing enforceable stay-at-home orders. Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced a sweeping new $775 billion investment in caregiving programs on Tuesday, with a series of proposals covering care for small children, older adults and family members with disabilities. Mississippi on Tuesday reported more than 1,630 cases, a single-day record for the state.  Executives from four companies in the race to produce a coronavirus vaccine told lawmakers on Tuesday that they are optimistic their products could be ready by the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021. All four companies — AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Pfizer — are testing proprietary vaccines in various phases of human clinical trials. Arizona is averaging more than 3,000 new cases a day this month, double what it was in mid-June. The state’s death toll is steadily climbing to nearly 3,000. But disease specialists are expressing cautious optimism that the crisis there may be leveling off or even starting to ebb. A study of patients in New York published in the journal JAMA reports that blood clotting problems may be significantly more common among Covid-19 patients than among those with other infectious diseases. And patients with blood-clotting problems were twice as likely to die, the study found. The U.S. Justice Department accused a pair of Chinese hackers on Tuesday of targeting vaccine development on behalf of the country’s intelligence service. Justice Department officials called the suspects a blended threat who sometimes worked on behalf of China’s spy services and sometimes worked to enrich themselves. The officials said that an indictment secured against them earlier this month and unsealed on Tuesday was the first to target such a threat. The hacking was part of a broader, yearslong campaign of cybertheft by the pair aimed at an array of industries. American government officials said that at the behest of China’s spy service, the two hackers shifted their focus this year to trying to acquire vaccine research and other information about the pandemic. The indictment came as the Trump administration has stepped up its criticism of Beijing, both for its theft of secrets and its failure to contain the spread of the virus, and is a significant escalation of that effort. The Justice Department said that China’s covert activity could potentially set back research efforts. The accusations also came days after the United States and allied countries accused Russia of trying to steal information on vaccine development. Global Roundup South Korea has been praised for making effective use of digital tools to contain the virus, from emergency phone alerts to aggressive contact tracing based on a variety of data. But one pillar of that strategy, a mobile app that helps enforce quarantines, had serious security flaws that made private information vulnerable to hackers, a software engineer has found. The defects, which were confirmed by The New York Times and have been fixed, could have let attackers retrieve the names, real-time locations and other details of people in quarantine. The flaws could also have allowed hackers to tamper with data to make it look as if users of the app were either violating quarantine orders or still in quarantine despite being somewhere else. In April, South Korea began requiring all visitors and residents arriving from abroad to isolate themselves for two weeks. To monitor compliance, they had to install an app with a name in Korean that means Self-Quarantine Safety Protection. As of last month, more than 162,000 people had downloaded the app, which tracks users’ locations to ensure they remain in designated quarantine areas. Violators might be required to wear tracking wristbands or pay steep fines. “We were really in a hurry to make and deploy this app as quickly as possible to help slow down the spread of the virus,” said Jung Chan-hyun, an official at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety’s disaster response division, which oversees the app. “We could not afford a time-consuming security check on the app that would delay its deployment.” Here are other developments from around the world: As the dust settled on days of rancorous negotiations, the compromises that allowed Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country holds the European Union’s rotating presidency, to guide 27 nations toward consensus on a landmark spending package were all the more apparent, and none too pretty, wrote Steven Erlanger and Matina Stevis-Gridneff in an analysis for The New York Times. Hong Kong will require travelers from the United States and Kazakhstan to show proof that they have tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of boarding a flight to the city. The government had already introduced this regulation for travelers from seven other countries it deemed high-risk, including Bangladesh, India, South Africa and the Philippines. Nearly 900,000 public workers in Britain, including teachers, doctors and security forces, will receive raises in recognition of the “vital contribution” they have made, Britain’s finance ministry announced Tuesday. Chinese officials are hailing a visit by a team of experts sent to Beijing by the World Health Organization to investigate the source of the coronavirus as evidence that the country is a responsible and transparent global power. But the investigation by the W.H.O. is likely to take many months and could face delays. Air passengers to China must provide a negative test result before boarding the flight, the aviation authority said. The test must be completed within five days of the trip. After four months of lockdown, Nepal is lifting most restrictions and will soon open schools, restaurants, international flights and mountain trekking. The government said the number of new coronavirus infections was decreasing, from a daily high of 700 a few weeks ago to 150 now or lower. The country of 30 million people has reported 17,994 infections and 40 deaths.  A former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday called on state health officials to start reporting coronavirus data in a detailed and uniform fashion, rather than the hodgepodge most states now produce. “We have a real vacuum of leadership at the national level,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former C.D.C. director, who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit health advocacy initiative. “Absent a national strategy, our best hope is to get all 50 states on the same page, so we know where we are.” Other public health experts said that such guidelines were long overdue and that the C.D.C.’s current director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, should have mandated them months ago. Dr. Irwin E. Redlener, founding director of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness, said it was “pathetic” that a private organization had to propose data standards and recruit states to voluntarily agree. “The feds should have been demanding exactly this kind of standardized information from every state and territory since March,” he said. “This is another illustration of the failures of the federal government — Trump was explicit in telling governors that they were on their own.” Dr. Frieden’s organization, concluding that states are reporting only 40 percent of the data needed to fight the pandemic, laid out 15 indicators that every state should report daily on a public “dashboard” that anyone can view. They include not just basic elements like cases, hospitalizations and deaths, but sophisticated metrics. Among them: what percentage of infections came from clusters of people who knew one another; how many health care workers are infected on the job; how long it takes to get a diagnostic test result; and what percentage ofresidents are wearing masks. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who helped design the data dashboard used by New York State and cited by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo during his news conferences, said Dr. Frieden’s proposal was “something we need in our tool kit that’s been absent.” As the virus surges around the world, government officials and business owners are increasingly turning to mask requirements to try to slow the spread of infection. Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami said Tuesday that the city would assign 39 police officers to a new unit that enforces mask violations. “All they will do for the whole week is mask enforcement,” he said. Austria announced on Tuesday a new mask mandate to go into effect on Friday for supermarkets and other stores that sell food, as well as post offices, banks and houses of worship. Cases in the alpine nation have begun rising again since restrictions were eased. On Tuesday, Austria recorded 1,386 active cases — roughly the same number as in mid-March, when the country was placed on lockdown. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said the police would arrest people for not wearing masks in public. “We have to ask our police to be more strict,” he said. “Catch them. A little shame, or put them on notice forever.” Southeastern Grocers, the owner of the Winn-Dixie chain of supermarkets, joined the growing list of retailers that are requiring customers to wear masks. The announcement late Monday came a day after a company spokesman defended the company’s earlier policy of not requiring them. The new policy will go into effect on July 27. Another large grocery chain in the region, Publix, started to require masks on Tuesday.

Brazil Health Workers May Have Spread Coronavirus to Indigenous People,2020-07-19,"By Manuela Andreoni, Ernesto Londoño and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — The telltale symptoms began in late May, about a week after government medical workers made a routine visit to the Kanamari Indigenous community in a remote part of the Amazon: Elderly members of the group were struggling to breathe. For months, as the coronavirus tore through Brazil, the Kanamari had sought to shield themselves from the pandemic by strictly limiting access to their riverside villages in the secluded Javari Valley, one of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territories. But it seemed even there, the virus had reached them. Panic set in. “Many people grabbed some clothes, a hammock and ran into the forest to hide,” said Thoda Kanamari, a leader of the union of Indigenous peoples in the vast territory, home to groups with little contact with the outside world. “But it was too late, everyone was already infected.” And the vectors of the disease, according to interviews and federal data obtained by The New York Times, may have been the health workers charged by the federal government with protecting the country’s Indigenous populations. More than 1,000 workers with the federal Indigenous health service, known as Sesai, have tested positive for coronavirus as of early July, a freedom of information request and interviews with union representatives found. Working without adequate protective equipment or access to enough tests, these workers may have inadvertently endangered the very communities they were trying to help, medical workers and Indigenous leaders said. More than 15,500 Indigenous Brazilians have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, including at least 10,889 living in protected territories, according to Instituto Socioambiental, an Indigenous rights organization. At least 523 have died. In the sparsely populated Javari Valley, in northwestern Brazil, the federal Indigenous health care agency said it had identified 220 cases and one death. Robson Santos da Silva, the Army colonel at the head of Sesai, defended the agency’s response during the pandemic, and brushed off criticism as “a lot of disinformation, a lot of politics.” “We’re on the front lines,” he said. “We’re battling this disease daily.” In an emailed statement, Sesai said reports that health workers had exposed Indigenous people to the virus were “inconclusive.” The agency said its employees were outfitted with protective equipment. “All this planning and early research led to timely and efficient care that was delivered in villages,” the statement said. But The Times found that in at least six field offices, the share of infected workers was above the Amazon region’s average of 8 percent for the general population. Two field offices in particular had extraordinarily high rates of infection, according to tallies compiled by health care unions. The office overseeing the state of Amapá and the northern part of the state of Pará reported that 186 people — almost half of its health workers — had tested positive for the virus. And in the office covering the Yanomami community, which straddles the border between Brazil and Venezuela, 207 workers — more than 20 percent of the medical staff — became infected. Representatives of the health care workers’ union and experts say the true caseload among the federal Indigenous health workers is likely much higher. Many of those on the front lines have sought tests on their own, but as of June 30, the Indigenous health service had only tested 1,080 of its employees, roughly five percent of its work force. The large share of infected workers suggests “there were failures in the protection of health care workers at a critical moment, affecting teams that care for a highly vulnerable population,” said Felipe Tavares, who researches Indigenous health at the Federal Fluminense University. Health care workers, Indigenous leaders and experts described a bungled response beset by the broader shortcomings that have turned Brazil into a global epicenter of the pandemic. Brazil has recorded 78,772 coronavirus deaths and more than two million confirmed cases as of Sunday — numbers that are second only to the United States. Tests have been in short supply and often unreliable, which means some doctors and nurses with asymptomatic or undiagnosed cases have traveled to vulnerable communities and worked in them for days. Some teams have had to procure their own masks and other protective gear. Lax and poorly-communicated quarantine protocols, and the absence of effective contact-tracing, have allowed the virus to spread with ease among people living in close quarters. Indigenous leaders said it’s impossible to determine with certainty how many cases were introduced by health care workers. Some Indigenous people may have brought the virus into their communities after traveling to cities to gather supplies and emergency government aid. Illegal miners and loggers who operate in Indigenous territories may also have exposed some communities. Luiza Garnelo, a doctor and anthropologist at Fiocruz Amazônia, a government health research agency in the Amazon, said the pandemic had exposed the defenselessness of communities that had already been grappling with substandard medical care, poverty, and often violent land invasions. “Long before the epidemic hit, investment in Indigenous health care was insufficient and the resources that are available were not harnessed in a way that enabled an effective response to the epidemic,” she said. “The Indigenous population is socially and economically vulnerable.” Some communities pleaded for more robust medical care as the pandemic gripped Brazil. “Since March we have been begging, we need help, we need help, we need emergency hiring of health care workers,” said Júnior Yanomami, who heads the Indigenous council at the Yanomami health department in Boa Vista, the capital of the state of Roraima. But at least 90 of the 131 health care workers assigned to Boa Vista during the outbreak have tested positive, according to Mr. Yanomami. They were, unwittingly, among the primary vectors for infection of the 262 Yanomami people who have been diagnosed with the virus, he said. Five of the Yanomami have died. When Mr. da Silva, the Army colonel who heads the Indigenous health agency, flew to several Yanomami villages in late June to deliver protective equipment and administer tests, tribal leaders said, they felt like they were being used for photo ops. “We want the government to help Indigenous peoples, as it is their obligation to do, but not like this,” Mr. Yanomami said. Carmem Pankararu, the president of the Indigenous health care workers union, said workers were hobbled by a bureaucracy that was slow to get tests and critical supplies to regions where transportation and logistics are extraordinarily hard even in normal times. “They would only test when we showed symptoms,” she said. “We needed mass testing.” Criticism of President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic, within Indigenous territories and beyond, is mounting. After losing two health ministers who were physicians, in April and May, Mr. Bolsonaro put the health ministry in the hands of an active-duty Army general, who has filled the ministry’s senior ranks with military officers who are not experts in health care. Early this month, a judge on Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered the government to redouble efforts to shield Indigenous people from the virus by coming up with a comprehensive plan within 30 days and setting up a “situation room” staffed by officials and Indigenous representatives. More recently, another Supreme Court judge generated consternation in the Bolsonaro administration by warning that the armed forces could be held responsible for a “genocide” over their handling of the pandemic in Indigenous communities. Several Sesai workers who spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation, described an exceptionally challenging mission, impaired by poor guidance, mistrust from many Indigenous communities and a scarcity of tests. Enoque Taurepang, the coordinator of the Indigenous Council of Roraima, said doctors and nurses had been set up for failure. “You can’t blame health professionals because they didn’t have the tools necessary to act,” he said. Meanwhile, the losses to the Indigenous mount. Edney Kokama, a leader of the Kokama tribe, lost his father and his grandfather to the virus, which he said had killed at least 58 members of the tribe in Brazil. His grandfather and his grandfather’s wife, who also died, were among the most fluent writers of the tribe’s language, which younger members don’t know as well. “My grandfather was editing a Kokama dictionary. He was one of the few who still spoke it,” he said. “We’ve lost so much knowledge.”']","Many people assigned to care for the Indigenous have been infected, exposing remote communities to the virus. Health workers say they have been plagued by insufficient testing and protective gear."
Europe Said It Was Pandemic-Ready. Pride Was Its Downfall.,2020-07-20,,"['The coronavirus exposed European countries’ misplaced confidence in faulty models, bureaucratic busywork and their own wealth. By David D. Kirkpatrick, Matt Apuzzo and Selam Gebrekidan LONDON — Prof. Chris Whitty, Britain’s chief medical adviser, stood before an auditorium in a London museum two years ago cataloging deadly epidemics. From the Black Death of the 14th century to cholera in war-torn Yemen, it was a baleful history. But Professor Whitty, who had spent most of his career fighting infectious diseases in Africa, was reassuring. Britain, he said, had a special protection. “Being rich,” he explained. Wealth “massively hardens a society against epidemics,” he argued, and quality of life — food, housing, water and health care — was more effective than any medicine at stopping the diseases that ravaged the developing world. Professor Whitty’s confidence was hardly unique. As recently as February, when European health ministers met in Brussels to discuss the novel coronavirus emerging in China, they commended their own health systems and promised to send aid to poor and developing countries. “Responsibility is incumbent on us, not only for Italy and Europe, but also for the African continent,” said Roberto Speranza, Italy’s health minister. “The European Union should be ready for support,” agreed Maggie De Block, Belgium’s then health minister. Barely a month later, the continent was overwhelmed. Instead of serving primarily as a donor, providing aid to former colonies, Western Europe became an epicenter of the pandemic. Officials once boastful about their preparedness were frantically trying to secure protective gear and materials for tests, as death rates soared in Britain, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium. This was not supposed to happen. The expertise and resources of Western Europe were expected to provide the antidote to viral outbreaks flowing out of poorer regions. Many European leaders felt so secure after the last pandemic — the 2009 swine flu — that they scaled back stockpiles of equipment and faulted medical experts for overreacting. But that confidence would prove their undoing. Their pandemic plans were built on a litany of miscalculations and false assumptions. European leaders boasted of the superiority of their world-class health systems but had weakened them with a decade of cutbacks. When Covid-19 arrived, those systems were unable to test widely enough to see the peak coming — or to guarantee the safety of health care workers after it hit. Accountability mechanisms proved toothless. Thousands of pages of national pandemic planning turned out to be little more than exercises in bureaucratic busy work. Officials in some countries barely consulted their plans; in other countries, leaders ignored warnings about how quickly a virus could spread. European Union checks of each country’s readiness had become rituals of self-congratulation. Mathematical models used to predict pandemic spreads — and to shape government policy — fed a false sense of security. National stockpiles of medical supplies were revealed to exist mostly on paper, consisting in large part of “just in time” contracts with manufacturers in China. European planners overlooked the risk that a pandemic, by its global nature, could disrupt those supply chains. National wealth was powerless against worldwide shortages. Held in high esteem for its scientific expertise, Europe, especially Britain, has long educated many of the best medical students from Asia, Africa and Latin America. On a visit to South Korea after a 2015 outbreak of the coronavirus MERS, Dame Sally Davies, then England’s chief medical officer, was revered as an expert. Upon her return home, she assured colleagues that such an outbreak could not happen in Britain’s public health system. Now South Korea, with a death toll below 300, is a paragon of success against the pandemic. Many epidemiologists there are dumbfounded at the mess made by their mentors. “It has come as a bit of a shock to a number of Koreans,” said Prof. Seo Yong-seok of Seoul National University, suggesting that perhaps British policymakers “thought that an epidemic is a disease that only occurs in developing countries.” Not every Western democracy stumbled. Germany, with a chancellor trained in physics and a sizable domestic biotech sector, managed it better than most. Greece, with fewer resources, has reported fewer than 200 deaths. But with several countries expected to conduct public inquests into what went wrong, Europe is grappling with how a continent considered among the most advanced failed so miserably. Its downfall presaged the chaos now unfolding in the United States, where President Trump initially responded to the pandemic by blaming continental Europe and cutting off travel. “No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States,” he declared on March 11, assuring Americans that “the risk is very, very low.” “The virus will not have a chance against us,” Mr. Trump said. Today, the United States has the highest number of cases in the world and a death rate that is again rising, closing in on the European nations already humbled by the virus. Belgium, by some measures, has the world’s highest death rate. Italy’s wealthiest region was shattered. France’s much-praised health system was reduced to relying on military helicopters to rescue patients from overcrowded hospitals. Britain, though, most embodies Europe’s miscalculations because of the country’s great pride in its expertise and readiness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was so confident that Britain’s modelers could forecast the epidemic with precision, records and testimony show, that he delayed locking down the country for days or weeks after most of Europe. He waited until two weeks after British emergency rooms began to buckle under the strain. With the number of infections doubling every three days at the time, some scientists now say that locking down a week sooner might have saved 30,000 lives. Dr. Whitty, 54, initially praised in British newspapers as the reassuring “geek-in-chief,” has declined to speak publicly about his role in those decisions. His friends say the government has set him up to take the blame. “The politicians say they are ‘following the science’ and then if they make the wrong decisions it is on him,” said Prof. David Mabey of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a friend and colleague. “I am not sure the politicians listen to him.” Critics, though, say it is impossible to absolve the government’s scientific advisers of shared responsibility. “They thought they could be more clever than other countries,” said Prof. Devi Sridhar, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. “They thought they could outsmart the virus.” Sir David King, a former British chief science officer, said, “The word ‘arrogance’ comes to mind, I am afraid.” He added: “What hubris.” Fear swept the continent. It was spring of 2009 and a new virus that became known as swine flu had infected hundreds and killed dozens in Mexico. European vacationers swarmed airports to get home. Experts recalled the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed as many as 50 million people around the world. European governments sprang into action. France asked the European Union to cut off travel to Mexico and began buying doses of vaccine for everyone in the country. British hospitals enlisted retired health workers and distributed stockpiled masks, gloves and aprons. Every country in Europe had drawn up and rehearsed its own detailed pandemic plan, often running into the hundreds of pages. Britain’s plans read like the script of a horror movie, if written in the language of a bureaucrat. More than 1.3 million people could be hospitalized and 800,000 could die. Trying to contain the pandemic “would be a waste of public health resources.” These doomsday scenarios drew on a new subspecialty of epidemiology pioneered by British scientists: using abstruse mathematical models to project the path of a contagious disease. One early disciple, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, had assumed a pre-eminence in British health policy. Professor Ferguson was an Oxford-trained physicist who shifted to mathematical epidemiology in the 1990s, after watching a close friend’s brother die of AIDS. Other scientific advisers say Professor Ferguson, now 52, stands out for his self-assured style in delivering easy-to-understand answers under enormous time pressure. “He is able to answer questions succinctly and clearly and with a very measured conclusion, and it is exactly the sort of information that politicians need,” said Peter Openshaw, a professor of medicine at Imperial College London who sits with Professor Ferguson on a panel that advises the government on respiratory viruses. Traditional public health experts, emphasizing clinical experience and field observations, were skeptical. They warned that the projections were only as good as their data and assumptions, and that policymakers without a background in math might treat models as dependable predictions. An epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease among livestock in Britain in 2001 was the first time policymakers relied on such modeling while addressing an outbreak. Over the objections of veterinarians, Professor Ferguson’s work guided policymakers to preventively slaughter more than six million pigs, sheep and cattle. Later studies concluded most of the killing was needless. A review commissioned by the government urged that policymakers “must not rely on the model to make a decision for them.” “‘Muddlers,’ we call them,” said Alex Donaldson, then head of Britain’s Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute for Animal Health. “In future epidemics the first thing that should be done is to lock up the predictive modelers.” Yet when swine flu emerged, British leaders again turned to Professor Ferguson and the large modeling department he had built at Imperial College. He projected that swine flu, in a reasonable worst case, could kill nearly 70,000. Elected officials were horrified. Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, presided over frantic meetings bracing for the absence from work of nearly half the city’s police officers and subway drivers. “It is impossible to say how bad it will be,” Mr. Johnson warned soberly. But the modelers’ “reasonable worst case” was wildly off. Swine flu ended up killing fewer than 500 people in Britain, less than in a seasonal flu. Dr. Catherine Snelson, then completing her training in critical care at a hospital in Birmingham, had been assigned to help transfer out excess patients. “We actually sat there doing nothing,” she recalled. For Mr. Johnson, the swine flu episode reinforced instincts not to impose restrictions in the name of public health. “He believes people will make the right decisions on their own,” said Victoria Borwick, a former deputy mayor. An official review cautioned: “Modelers are not ‘court astrologers.’” Some experts now say Europe learned the wrong lesson from the swine flu. “It created some kind of complacency,” said Prof. Steven Van Gucht, a virologist involved in the Belgian response. “Oh, a pandemic again? We have a good health system. We can cope with this.” It also coincided with Europe’s worst economic slump in decades. French legislators were furious at the cost of buying millions of doses of vaccines and faulted the government for needlessly stockpiling more than 1.7 billion protective masks. To cut costs, France, Britain and other governments shifted more of their stockpiles to “just in time” contracts. Health officials assumed that even in a crisis they could buy what they needed on the international market, typically from China, which manufactures more than half the world’s masks. By the start of 2020, France’s supply of masks had fallen by more than 90 percent, to just 150 million. “The idea of a government warehousing medical supplies came to seem outdated,” said Francis Delattre, a French senator who raised alarms about dependence on China. “Our fate was put into the hands of a foreign dictatorship.” “France has a superiority complex,” Mr. Delattre added, “especially when it comes to the health sector.” Two years after swine flu, Britain scattered three quarters of its spending for public health to local governments, where it was harder to track and more easily diverted. Four hundred health experts warned in an open letter that decentralization would “disrupt, fragment and weaken the country’s public health capabilities,” and in the following years per capita spending on public health steadily declined. A national network that had once included 52 laboratories was eventually reduced to two national facilities and a handful of regional centers primarily serving the internal needs of regional hospitals. Health officials also chose to limit stockpiles of protective equipment to deal with an influenza outbreak: enough for use during certain procedures in hospitals, but not for more general use, emergency rooms, doctors’ offices, or nursing homes. Scientists knew a coronavirus like SARS or MERS could require more equipment. “It’s pretty difficult to build a stockpile for something you’ve not seen before,” said Dr. Ben Killingley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government on what to stockpile. “It depends how much you want to spend on your insurance.” On the surface, Europe’s defenses still looked robust. European Union reviews of each country’s pandemic readiness seemed to provide oversight, but the process was misleading. National governments barred the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control from setting benchmarks or pointing out deficiencies. So the agency’s public remarks were almost unfailingly positive. Britain, Spain and Greece were lauded for their “highly motivated experts,” “trusted expert organizations” and “confidence in the system.” “We couldn’t say, ‘You should have this,’” said Arthur Bosman, a former agency trainer. “The advice and the assessment had to be phrased in an observation.” European health officials recognized the vulnerability of national stockpiles. In response, the European Union in 2016 solicited bids to build a continent-wide repository. But the initiative fizzled because Britain, France and other large countries thought they had the situation covered. Belgium later destroyed tens of millions of expired masks from its own stockpile and never replaced them. In 2016, Britain tested its readiness in a drill called Exercise Cygnus. Nine hundred officials across the country participated in a make-believe response to a “swan flu” that had emerged in Thailand and killed more than 200,000 people in Britain. The planners evidently never imagined that acquiring protective gear from abroad could present a problem. “Ordering arrangements in place” was assumed as part of the background. Over all, the drill revealed that many British officials were unfamiliar with the country’s pandemic plans and unsure of their roles, according to participants and a final report. “It showed a hollowing out of the government, inside the infrastructure,” said Prof. Robert Dingwall, a sociologist who advises the government on respiratory viruses and helped draft the plans. “And that was never corrected.” Two years later, in the real world, health industry journals reported a Chinese government crackdown on pollution shuttered a factory that was providing 1.75 million protective aprons each week to British hospitals. Shortages rippled through the system. Newspapers declared an “apron crisis.” No one apparently imagined what would happen to Europe if all Chinese supplies were choked off at once. On Jan. 28, British scientists raised an alarm. The expanding epidemic was setting off a global run on personal protective equipment, specifically on the face-covering mechanical hoods that provide the gold standard of safety. A decision to stock up any later “could pose a risk in terms of availability,” warned the government’s respiratory virus advisory panel. It is unclear when Britain began in earnest to try to augment its supplies of protective equipment. The health ministry has said only that it began unspecified “discussions and orders” during the week beginning Jan. 27. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, later acknowledged that by the time Britain began buying, the spike in global demand had made protective equipment “precious” and procurement “a huge challenge.” The Doctors’ Association UK, an advocacy group, later said it received more than 1,300 complaints from doctors at more than 260 hospitals about inadequate protective equipment. At least 300 British health workers eventually died after contracting Covid-19. “We worry that some died because of a lack of personal protective equipment,” said Dr. Rinesh Parmar, the group’s chairman. “It was very shortsighted to think that supply lines would continue to China.” On the continent, governments that had resisted benchmarks from the European center for disease control now flooded the agency with desperate questions, including about what equipment to stock. The agency published a list of what was needed on Feb. 7, but by then global supplies had all but run out. “It was already way more than what they could get their hands on,” said Dr. Agoritsa Baka, a senior doctor at the European center. In Belgium, a shortage of masks became so desperate that King Philippe personally brokered a donation from the Chinese tech company Alibaba. European and global health officials had thoroughly reviewed Belgium’s pandemic plan over the years. But when Covid-19 hit, Belgian officials did not even consult it. “It has never been used,” said Dr. Emmanuel André, who was drafted to help lead the country’s coronavirus response. In France, President Emmanuel Macron tacitly acknowledged the depletion of the government’s stockpile at the beginning of March by requisitioning all the masks in the country. But he still insisted France was ready. “We are not going to stop life in France,” his spokeswoman assured radio listeners. Ten days later, Mr. Macron declared a state of war and ordered a strict lockdown. “I don’t understand why we were not prepared,” said Dr. Matthieu Lafaurie, of the Saint-Louis hospital in Paris. “It was very surprising that every country had to realize itself what was going on, as if they didn’t have the examples of other countries. ” In Britain, Mr. Johnson told the public to stay “confident and calm.” But, the same day, Feb. 11, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or SAGE, privately concluded that the country’s diminished public health system was incapable of widespread Covid-19 testing, even by the end of the year. “It is not possible,” the group’s minutes note. The British scientists and officials nonetheless thought they knew better than other countries like China and South Korea. Those countries were driving down the infection rate by imposing lockdowns. The British science advisers thought such restrictions were shortsighted. Unless the restrictions were permanent, any reduction of the epidemic would be lost to a “second peak,” SAGE concluded, according to its minutes and three participants. Britain reported its first death from the virus on March 5. Across Europe, the number of confirmed cases was doubling every three days. Much of northern Italy was already locked down. Testifying that day before a parliamentary committee, Professor Whitty, the chief medical adviser, was steady and comforting. Slightly hunched over a table in a small hearing room, he told lawmakers to place their trust in Britain’s modelers. They were “the best in the world,” he said. “We will be able to model this out, as it starts to accelerate, with a fair degree of confidence.” Despite alarming reports from Italy, he said, there was no way yet to predict the virus’s ultimate punch.  But he emphasized that Britain had “quite a long period” before the outbreak would peak, and said modeling would allow the government to wait until the latest possible moment before imposing social restrictions. “We are keen not to intervene,” he said, “until the point when we absolutely have to.” Mr. Johnson was even more sanguine. “It should be business as usual for the overwhelming majority of people,” he said that day in a television interview. But doctors in British hospitals were already feeling rising pressure. Intensive care wards were pushed to more than double their capacity in Birmingham, London and elsewhere. “It became clear that the pandemic plan wasn’t going to cut it,” said Jonathan Brotherton, chief operating officer of University Hospitals Birmingham, England’s largest health system. At an increasingly agitated SAGE meeting on March 10, the scientists concluded from the number of cases in intensive care units that there were at least 5,000 to 10,000 infections around the country. “There will be thousands of deaths a day,” Professor Ferguson remembers warning surprised cabinet officials sitting in on a meeting. Six days later, Professor Ferguson reported that SAGE’s modeling panel had moved up its projections. The peak was now almost at hand — within two weeks, at the beginning of April, not over the summer, as previously projected. Professor Ferguson released a public study that day that for the first time projected a potential British death toll in the hundreds of thousands. Switching course, the committee urged sweeping social distancing measures, including school closures. “It would be better to act early,” the group advised, according to minutes of the meeting. Much of Europe, including France, had already shut down. Mr. Johnson waited another week, until March 23, to order a mandatory lockdown. Britain, Spain, Belgium, France and Italy have now reported some of the highest per capita death tolls in the world. More than 30,000 people have died in France, and Mr. Macron has admitted his government was unprepared. “This moment, let’s be honest, has revealed cracks, shortages,” he said. After 44,000 coronavirus deaths in Britain, officials continue to defend their actions. The government’s response “allowed us to protect the vulnerable and ensured that the National Health Service was not overwhelmed even at the virus’ peak,” a health department spokesman said. But Mr. Johnson has admitted that his government had responded “sluggishly,” like in “that recurring bad dream when you are telling your feet to run and your feet won’t move.” Several scientific advisers have sought to distance themselves from his policies. Professor Ferguson said in an interview that the decision not to intervene earlier was made by the government and health officials — not the modelers. “They came back to us and say, ‘Can you model this? Can you model that?’” he said. “And we did.” He insisted that he had warned privately in early March that Britain’s insufficient testing meant the scientists did not have enough information to track the epidemic. Across Europe, he said, more testing “would have been the single thing which would have made the biggest difference.” Other scientists say the intensive care reports in early March should have been reason enough to lock down without waiting for more testing or models. But there is another lesson to learn, said Dr. André, who spent years fighting epidemics in Africa before advising Belgium on the coronavirus. “They keep on telling countries what they should do, very clearly. But all these experts, when it happens in your own countries? There’s nothing,” he said. “One lesson to learn is humility.” Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting from Brussels.']",
"‘No One’ Protected British Democracy From Russia, U.K. Report Concludes",2020-07-21,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Russia has mounted a prolonged, sophisticated campaign to undermine Britain’s democracy and corrupt its politics, while successive British governments have looked the other way, according to a long-delayed report released on Tuesday by a British parliamentary committee. From meddling in elections and spreading disinformation to funneling dirty money and employing members of the House of Lords, the Russians have tried to co-opt politicians and corrode institutions, often with little resistance from law enforcement or intelligence agencies that ignored years of warning signs. The report, in many ways harder on British officials than the Russians, did not answer the question of whether Russia swayed one of the most consequential votes in modern British history: the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. But it was unforgiving about who is protecting British democracy. “No one is,” the report’s authors said. “The outrage isn’t if there is interference,” said Kevan Jones, a Labour Party member of Parliament who served on the intelligence committee that released the report. “The outrage is no one wanted to know if there was interference.” The release of the report came more than seven months after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party racked up an 80-seat majority in Parliament and almost 18 months after the end of the inquiry by the Intelligence and Security Committee, a parliamentary body that oversees the country’s spy agencies. Still, it was eagerly awaited in Britain, where anxieties about Russia’s behavior range from influence-peddling with oligarchs in London to the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence agent and his daughter in Salisbury, England. The report also landed in the heat of an American presidential election, shadowed by questions about ties between President Trump and Russia, as well as fears of renewed foreign tampering, not just by Russia, but also by China and Iran. The committee’s account characterized Russia as a reckless country bent on recapturing its status as a “great power,” primarily by destabilizing those in the West. “The security threat posed by Russia is difficult for the West to manage as, in our view and that of many others, it appears fundamentally nihilistic,” the authors said. Experts said the report showed parallels between Britain and the United States in the failure to pick up warning signs, but also important differences. The F.B.I. and other American agencies, they said, had investigated election interference more aggressively than their British counterparts, while the British were ahead of the United States in scrutinizing how Russian money had corrupted politics. “This is one of the pieces that is not really well understood in the U.S.,” said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which tracks Russian disinformation efforts in the United States. “Whether there is dirty Russian money that has flowed into our political system.” The report described how British politicians had welcomed oligarchs to London, allowing them to launder their illicit money through what it called the London “laundromat.” A growth industry of “enablers” — lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and public relations consultants — sprang up to serve their needs. These people, the report said, “played a role, wittingly or unwittingly, in the extension of Russian influence which is often linked to promoting the nefarious interests of the Russian state.” Several members of the House of Lords, the report said, had business interests linked to Russia or worked for companies with Russian ties. It urged an investigation of them, though it did not name any names. That information, as well as the names of politicians who received donations, was redacted from the public report, along with other sensitive intelligence. “The most disturbing thing is the recognition of what the Russian government has gotten away, under our eyes,” said William F. Browder, an American-born British financier who has worked extensively in Russia and provided evidence to the committee. “The government, and particularly law enforcement, has been toothless.” The report painted a picture of years of Russian interference through disinformation spread by traditional media outlets, like the cable-TV channel RT, and by the use of internet bots and trolls. This activity dated back to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, but it was never confronted by the country’s political establishment or by an intelligence community with other priorities. Focused more on clandestine operations, the spy agencies were anxious to keep their distance from political campaigns, regarding them as a “hot potato,” the report said. Nor was it clear who in the government was in charge of countering the Russian threat to destabilize Britain’s political process. “It has been surprisingly difficult to establish who has responsibility for what,” the report said. Despite pressing questions, the report said the government had shown little interest in investigating whether the Brexit referendum was targeted by Russia. The government responded that it had “seen no evidence of successful interference in the E.U. referendum” and dismissed the need for further investigation. But the committee suggested that the reason no evidence had been uncovered was because nobody had looked for it. “In response to our request for written evidence at the outset of the inquiry, MI5 initially provided just six lines of text,” the committee said. Had the intelligence agencies conducted a threat assessment before the vote, it added, it was “inconceivable” that they would not have concluded there was a Russian threat. Among the report’s most politically salient conclusions might be about a Russian influence campaign during the Scottish independence referendum. Nationalist sentiment is surging again in Scotland, partly because many voters consider the Scottish authorities to have handled the coronavirus pandemic better than the government in England. Based on its previous behavior, some experts said, Russia would try again to encourage the fracturing of the United Kingdom. “That obviously has implications for next year’s Scottish elections, and the polling on referendums,” said Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, a research institute in London. “All this is very, very relevant.” Concerns about Russian meddling and aggression stretch back more than a decade to the death in 2006 of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer and critic of the Kremlin, who was killed in London using a radioactive poison, polonium-210, believed to have been administered in a cup of tea. An inquiry concluded that his killing “was probably approved” by President Vladimir V. Putin. In 2018, another former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury, after a poisoning attack that left them hospitalized for weeks. Britain accused two Russians of using a rare nerve agent to try to kill Mr. Skripal, and expelled 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation. Although the report was approved by Downing Street in 2019, its release was held up before the election that gave Mr. Johnson his decisive parliamentary majority. Critics said he had been compromised by donations to his party from wealthy Russians living in Britain and they argued that the report was delayed unnecessarily. After the election, there was a second delay while Downing Street agreed on the membership of a new Intelligence and Security Committee. While the publicly available part of the report unearthed little new material, one expert said that it underscored the need to widen the focus and improve the coordination of Britain’s intelligence apparatus. “We did know most of this,” said Martin Innes, director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University, “but people were not joining the dots and seeing that quite a serious situation was developing.” “What Russia wants is to be able to play great power politics,” Professor Innes said. “And one of the ways of doing that is by destabilizing the U.K. and some of its close allies to create that space to maneuver.”']","Russian efforts to interfere in the British political system were widely ignored by successive governments, according to a long-awaited report by Parliament."
Pompeo Praises Britain for Getting Tough on China,2020-07-21,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday cheered the hardening British posture toward China and appealed for a global coalition against the country, blaming the Chinese Communist Party for what he described as exploitation of the coronavirus pandemic “to further its own interests.” Mr. Pompeo made the remarks on a visit to Britain, which in itself was something of a victory lap for the Trump administration. It had previously indicated that Britain had to choose whether to side with Beijing or Washington on matters like China’s role in telecommunications infrastructure. The secretary of state heaped praise on Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, for his government’s decision last week to ban equipment supplied by the Chinese technology giant Huawei from the country’s high-speed wireless network, among other things. “I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the British government for its principled responses to these challenges,” Mr. Pompeo said. “Well done.” The two men dismissed suspicions that Britain’s decisions had come at the behest of an American government locked in a widening confrontation with China. But analysts said that Mr. Pompeo’s embrace of his British counterparts would only make it more difficult for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to walk back from the brink of a deepening rift with Beijing. China’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, had lashed out at Britain on Monday night, accusing it of interfering in Chinese internal affairs and violating international law in its opposition to China’s crackdown on Hong Kong. Analysts said Mr. Pompeo’s remarks could further aggravate Britain’s worsening ties with China. “Pompeo’s sort of fulsome praise of how the British government has been working with the Americans is likely to make the Chinese response harder,” said Professor Steve Tsang, the director of the SOAS China Institute in London. “Now that may be what Pompeo wants to see. But that’s not what Dominic Raab or Boris Johnson want to see.” Professor Tsang said that Britain’s rebuff of Huawei had seemed calibrated not to provoke an outsized response from Beijing, since Mr. Johnson gave Huawei five months to continue selling equipment for Britain’s 5G networks before the ban takes effect. Mr. Johnson, a self-described “Sinophile,” has in the past praised efforts to take advantage of commercial opportunities through trade with China. “Johnson is trying to minimize the damages,” Professor Tsang said. But Mr. Johnson has been forced to change course in recent months as British public opinion, and the mood of his own Conservative Party, hardened in response to China’s crackdown on Hong Kong and its handling of the pandemic. Some Conservative lawmakers, among them the same politicians who once pushed a hard line on Britain’s exit from the European Union, have organized what they call the China Research Group, demanding that the government take a more aggressive approach to China for a number of reasons. Among them are China’s tough treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and fears that a United States-Britain trade deal — one of the desired outcomes of Brexit — would be jeopardized if Mr. Johnson spurned President Trump’s urgings for a more combative China policy. Mr. Pompeo met with some of those anti-China lawmakers from Britain’s Conservative Party on Tuesday. Among them was Iain Duncan Smith, a prominent Brexit supporter, who has lately called on the British government to ban TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform, arguing that it poses as much of a threat as Huawei. Mr. Pompeo has said the United States was looking at banning TikTok and other Chinese social media platforms. With tensions escalating between Western countries and China, Britain has taken a series of more aggressive steps in recent days. On Monday, it suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong to protest the new security law that tightened China’s grip on the former British colony and is seen by critics as jeopardizing long-cherished freedoms there. The suspension, ostensibly made in response to fears that anyone extradited to Hong Kong from Britain could be sent on to mainland China to face prosecution, was another indication that Western countries’ willingness to confront China has grown firmer since Beijing last month adopted the sweeping security law. For Mr. Pompeo, who has described China as the “central threat of our times,” the visit was an opportunity to solidify Britain’s support for a more confrontational approach to China. “It’s not about language, it’s not about words,” Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference with Mr. Raab on Tuesday. “We want every nation to work together to push back against the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts in every dimension that I described to you today.” He added, “That certainly includes the United Kingdom.” Within Britain, too, there are signs that the pressure on Mr. Johnson to continue his campaign against China will not abate. Anti-China lawmakers in Britain are said to be preparing to try to block efforts by a state-owned Chinese nuclear power company to expand its footprint in Britain.']",The secretary of state praised the British government for recent actions on China as the Trump administration tries to build a global coalition against Beijing.
India Offers Escape to Afghan Hindus and Sikhs Facing Attacks,2020-07-19,By Mujib Mashal and Fahim Abed,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Indian government said it will expedite visas and the possibility of long-term residency for Afghanistan’s tiny Hindu and Sikh minorities, shrunken by decades of persecution and decimated by attacks in recent years amid the Afghan war. “India has decided to facilitate the return of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan to India,” the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement on Saturday. The statement, on the rescue of an Afghan Sikh leader who was abducted in eastern Afghanistan last month, did not provide further details. An Indian official in Kabul said the decision meant that any of the roughly 600 Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan, an overwhelmingly Muslim country, would be given priority visas and the opportunity to apply for long-term residency once they arrived in India. In interviews, many welcomed the emergency option, but said it posed an agonizing dilemma. In Afghanistan, they have livelihoods — shops and businesses passed down through generations — but spend their days dreading the next attack. Making a new start in India would most likely mean living in poverty, they said, particularly during an economic slump exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Lala Sher Singh, 63, who lives near a Sikh temple in Kabul that was attacked in March, said the community had shrunk so much that his thoughts were occupied “day and night” by a fear that the next assault might not leave enough people who can perform the final rituals for the dead. “I may get killed here because of these threats to Hindus and Sikhs, but in India I will die from poverty,” he said. “I have spent my whole life in Afghanistan. In this neighborhood close to the temple, if I run out of money and stand in front of a shop and ask for two eggs and some bread, they will give it to me for free. But who will help me in India?” There was no official reaction from the Afghan government to India’s offer. A senior Afghan official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the news media, said that violence affected all Afghans, and that an offer of safety to Hindus and Sikhs put religious diversity in Afghanistan in doubt. The official said the move appeared aimed at a domestic audience in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to move the country away from its secular, multicultural foundations and give it a more overtly Hindu identity, while projecting itself as a champion of persecuted Hindu minorities elsewhere. The Hindu nationalist government recently amended India’s laws in a way that critics say blatantly discriminates against Muslims, giving a fast track to citizenship for migrants who are Hindu or members of five religious minorities — but not Muslim migrants. The law is one reason Muslims feel increasingly demonized and marginalized in India, though they are the second-largest religious group, making up one-seventh of the population. The status of Afghan religious minorities is more uncertain than ever, as the United States withdraws troops after more than 18 years and the Taliban, who ruled oppressively in the 1990s, prepare for talks with the government over power-sharing. The battlefield has grown more chaotic, joined by more extreme groups such as a branch of the Islamic State which specifically target vulnerable minorities. The Hindu and Sikh communities in Afghanistan once numbered in the tens, if not the hundreds, of thousands, with well-established businesses and high-ranking positions in the government. But nearly all have fled to India, Europe, or North America over decades of war and persecution. In the eastern province of Nangarhar, only 45 families remain from thousands before. In Paktia, another eastern province, only a single family remains — Jagmohan Singh, an herbal doctor, and his wife and two of their children. Their other two children have already decamped for Kabul. “A few decades back, there were around 3,000 families of Hindus and Sikhs in different areas and districts of Paktia,” Dr. Singh said. “Except my family, all of them fled.” As their numbers have shrunk, Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan often live in the same large compounds and sometimes also share a place of worship. Just over 600 Hindus and Sikhs now live across Afghanistan; two major attacks in the past two years have killed about 50, leaving practically every family scarred. The most recent attack was a six-hour siege by Islamic State militants on a Sikh temple and housing complex in Kabul, in March, that left 25 people dead, including young children. After the attack, as community leaders expressed alarm, Afghan officials, including the national security adviser, promised new safety measures. But Narendra Singh Khalsa, the community’s representative in the Afghan Parliament, said the temple remained shut and unrepaired. Except for a few additional police officers in the area, they had not received any support that would ease their concerns. “They have made some checkpoints where a number of police officers are present,” said Warjet Singh, 22, who runs a shop outside the temple, where his mother, father and brother were killed. “But the officials know that they cannot prevent any attack with a police officer standing in front of the temple,” he added. “There is no change in our situation,” he said. “I am still risking my life when I come out every morning for work; I am still worried about another attack on our compound.” Mr. Singh, who received financial assistance from the Afghan government, said life had become unbearable since the attack took his family and deprived him of a place of worship. His wife, who is pregnant with their first child, has dreaded going to the hospital because a maternity ward was recently attacked and mothers and babies were killed. “When India provides a long-term visa, I will go and live there until the security situation is better in my own country so I can return,” Mr. Singh said. “No one will take my country from me, but it’s important for me to survive so I can come back when things are good.” At best, India may be like a lifeboat — an emergency option for the families who take it, but one that lacks the security of a long-term solution. The relatives of Rawail Singh moved to New Delhi more than a year ago, but life there has not been easy. Mr. Singh was an activist who was one of 14 Sikhs killed in a 2018 suicide bombing in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, as they were filing in for a meeting with President Ashraf Ghani. Mr. Singh’s wife, Preeti, said she moved her three children to India in the months after her husband’s death. Her 16-year-old son, Prince, found work as an apprentice at a tailor shop, where he was paid about $110 a month. With that, bolstered by occasional aid sent by friends from Afghanistan and elsewhere, the family made do in the two rooms they rented for $30 a month. But as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, Prince lost his job; the tailor said he could no longer afford to pay apprentices. Preeti said her family spent their days confined to their two rooms, waiting for help to pay the rent. Prince is still looking for a job, but he has not found anything yet. “No one is giving us work,” he told his mother recently. “People say, ‘I can barely feed my own family, let alone hire you.’” Farooq Jan Mangal, Zabihullah Ghazi, and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.']","Members of the dwindling minority communities, gutted by recent deadly violence, welcomed an emergency exit but expressed worry that what would await them in India is poverty."
"Angela Merkel Guides the E.U. to a Deal, However Imperfect",2020-07-21,By Steven Erlanger and Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"[' BRUSSELS — After days and nights of rancorous haggling, European Union leaders reached an $857 billion pandemic recovery plan on Tuesday that, for the first time, committed them to borrow money collectively and distribute much of it as grants that do not need to be repaid by the countries hardest hit by the virus, like Italy. But as the dust settled after the marathon negotiations — the European Union’s longest summit meeting in 20 years — the compromises that allowed Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country holds the E.U.’s rotating presidency, to guide 27 nations toward consensus became all the more apparent, and none were too pretty. The fissures in the bloc that Ms. Merkel needed to bridge ran up, down and sideways. There were divides between the frugal north and a needy, hard-hit south; but also west to east, between Brussels and budding autocracies like Poland and Hungary that have tested the limits of the bloc’s liberal democratic values. But allowing the crisis stirred by the pandemic to worsen was in the end considered more dangerous than trimming some of the bloc’s larger budgetary ambitions or even allowing continued challenges to the rule of law. The compromise that got most attention was between President Emmanuel Macron of France, who pushed for large-scale grants to southern European countries like Italy and Spain hit hardest by the pandemic, and Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, who pressed for more loans than grants and for structural economic reforms in return. But how Ms. Merkel mollified the prime ministers of Hungary and Poland, Viktor Orban and Mateusz Morawiecki, may prove  more consequential. Not only was their money from Brussels protected and increased, despite regular questions about the misuse of those funds and efforts to condition the aid on adherence to the rule of law, but she promised to help them conclude bloc disciplinary measures against them for their alleged anti-democratic abuses. “Prime Minister Orban told me he wants to take the necessary steps and does not want this to hang in the air,’’ Ms. Merkel said early Tuesday about the disciplinary procedure that had been opened against Hungary. “We will support Hungary,’’ she said, “but of course the crucial steps will need to be taken by Hungary.’’ That concession, little remarked upon, may have sealed the agreement, even if it outrages critics who think that Brussels is showing weakness in the face of abuses of bloc laws and values by some Central European member states. And that aspect of the deal may end up being the most contentious in the European Parliament, which must approve it. The agreement “looks like a disaster for the rule of law,’’ said R. Daniel Kelemen, a scholar of Europe at Rutgers University. “Merkel and Macron were determined to reach a deal demonstrating the E.U.’s ability to respond to the crisis, and they proved willing to keep E.U. funds flowing to autocratic governments in order to close the deal.’’ Still, by tying the recovery fund into the seven-year budget, the first without Britain, they managed to solve two extremely difficult and tendentious problems at once. For all its messiness, there was little doubt that what they had achieved for the bloc was groundbreaking. Ms. Merkel understood that failure would badly undermine the new leaders of the European Union itself — Council President Charles Michel and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, a former member of Ms. Merkel’s government. Having joined with Mr. Macron in supporting a virus recovery fund borrowed for collectively — a first — she then patiently worked for consensus, understanding the political needs of both Mr. Macron, whose expansive vision for the E.U. remains unfulfilled, and of Mr. Rutte, whose government hangs by a thread, depending on politicians even more tightfisted than he. Mr. Macron and Mr. Rutte proved themselves two sometimes angry, sometimes emotional leaders of the two main contending groups, and the weekend talks were unusually acrimonious. With Britain gone, Mr. Rutte and his Austrian counterpart, Sebastian Kurz, have stepped forward to create a bloc of smaller countries, known as “the frugals,’’ which are trying to restrain the big-spending, integrationist ambitions of Mr. Macron and the poorer southern countries. But while they came to Brussels saying that they were opposed to any outright grants based on collective debt, it was obvious that there would be some once France and Germany pushed for them. Then the only question — however difficult — was to negotiate an amount and some mechanism to monitor the spending, so that everyone could go home talking of victory. France and Germany had proposed 500 billion euros in grants; the Commission took that and added another 250 billion in loans; in the end, after intense squabbling, the balance was 390 billion in grants and 360 billion in loans. Still, that is a remarkable victory for Mr. Macron, who has broken a major taboo on creating collective debt and built a possible architecture for handling future crises — if Ms. Merkel’s successors agree. For the future of the euro currency, the elephant in the room is Italy, the bloc’s third-largest economy by most measures, and already drowning in debt. Italy is both one of the least reformed economies in the eurozone and one of the hardest hit by the virus. So while both groups agreed that Italy must be a major beneficiary of funds that do not increase its already sizable debt pile, Mr. Rutte and his group — including Austria, Sweden, Denmark and often Finland — also wanted tough monitoring on the use of those funds. And they wanted member states to have a say in that monitoring, not just the Commission, the bloc’s unelected bureaucracy, which they regard as weak and often blind to abuses. That could create significant bitterness for the future. But for now, bending to reality, the “frugals’’ in return got the numbers down, got some form of state monitoring and got paid off with higher rebates in the budget. “Despite all this progress, we should not delude ourselves,’’ said Friedrich Heinemann, research department head at ZEW Mannheim, the Center for European Economic Research. “The lack of competitiveness and low growth prospects in countries like Italy cannot be solved with transfers and loans from Brussels. Only comprehensive reforms of labor markets, public administration and the education and innovation system will help.” Others were angered by the concessions to Mr. Orban, in particular, which may plant the seeds for future conflict. “Planned sanctions for E.U. member states that violate fundamental rights and the rule of law have been watered down beyond recognition,’’ said Daniel Freund, a German European legislator from the Greens. By now requiring a reinforced majority to impose sanctions, “the whole mechanism is rendered useless.’’ Ms. Merkel clearly decided she needed the fund more and “has always been lenient on Orban,’’ he said. The result, he said, puts leaders “on a collision course with the European Parliament and makes a quick agreement unlikely.’’ Not least, to reach consensus, the E.U. ended up with a smaller post-Brexit European budget, and one that eliminates or reduces spending for some ambitious projects designed to prepare Europe for the future — like in research and climate transition, a fund to promote consensus on carbon goals for 2030 that was slashed by one-third. Even with the virus, a proposed health fund evaporated entirely. There were also reductions from Commission proposals in other areas of investment, foreign policy and defense. Ms. von der Leyen called it “a difficult point” and said that such cuts, made in the search for a compromise, are “regrettable, it decreases the innovative part of the budget.’’ “It was all about give and take, so the victims seem to have been the E.U. public goods, which deliver value added to all,’’ said Jean Pisani-Ferry, a French economist, in a Twitter message. “The price of the deal looks high.” “This is not frugal. This is stupid,’’ said Henrik Enderlein, a German economist who heads of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, in a Twitter response. But he also applauded the larger deal and the recovery fund. “We shouldn’t be frugal in our judgment,’’ he said. “This is historic.” As Mr. Enderlein noted, the summit must be considered a breakthrough in a time of crisis when the European Union, now without Britain, could not be seen to fail. European fights about money and budgets are never pretty. But Ms. Merkel more than most understands that for all the talk of European solidarity, the European Union only proceeds when its varied leaders can convince their voters that they have fought the good fight for national interests. As Janis Emmanouilidis, director of Studies at the European Policy Centre, commented: “The price of no deal would have been much higher — potentially incalculable both economically and politically at the E.U. and national level.’’ But however important, this deal cannot be the last, he suggested, noting: “We are still at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.’’']","With her long experience as German chancellor, she shapes a necessary compromise on virus aid for the battered European south.

"India Rounds Up Critics Under Shadow of Virus Crisis, Activists Say",2020-07-19,By Sameer Yasir and Kai Schultz,"['NEW DELHI — After spending several anxious days in prison, Natasha Narwal, a student activist accused of rioting by the New Delhi police, thought her ordeal was nearing an end. A judge ruled that Ms. Narwal had been exercising her democratic rights when she participated in protests earlier this year against a divisive citizenship law that incited unrest across India. But shortly after the judge approved Ms. Narwal’s release in late May, the police announced fresh charges: murder, terrorism and organizing protests that instigated deadly religious violence in India’s capital. Ms. Narwal, 32, who has said that she is innocent, was returned to her cell. “I felt like crying,” said her roommate, Vikramaditya Sahai. “We are grieving the country we grew up in.” As India struggles to quell surging coronavirus infections, lawyers accuse the authorities of rounding up government critics and keeping them in detention in the middle of a pandemic. It is part of a strategy, they say, to stifle activists who are protesting what they see as iron-fisted and anti-minority policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In recent weeks, Ms. Narwal and nearly a dozen other prominent activists — along with potentially dozens of other demonstrators, though police records are unclear — have been detained. They are being held under stringent sedition and antiterrorism laws that have been used to criminalize everything from leading rallies to posting political messages on social media. India’s coronavirus restrictions, some of which are still in effect, have blocked pathways to justice, lawyers and rights activists say. With courts closed for weeks, lawyers have struggled to file bail applications, and meeting privately with prisoners has been nearly impossible. Law enforcement officials in New Delhi, who are under the direct control of India’s home ministry, have denied any impropriety. But rights groups say the arrests have been arbitrary, based on scant evidence and in line with a broader deterioration of free speech in India. In a lengthy report released this month, the Delhi Minorities Commission, a government body, accused the police and politicians from Mr. Modi’s party of inciting brutal attacks on protesters and supporting a “pogrom” against minority Muslims. Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said cases against the activists appeared to be “politically motivated,” and that the police had devised a formula for keeping people like Ms. Narwal in jail: When a judge orders the release of a prisoner for lack of evidence, new charges are introduced. “The urgency to arrest rights activists and an obvious reluctance to act against violent actions of the government’s supporters show a complete breakdown in the rule of law,” she said. Before the pandemic hit, Mr. Modi was in the throes of the most significant challenge to his power since becoming prime minister in 2014. After Parliament passed a law last year that made it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become Indian citizens, millions protested across the country. To critics, the citizenship law was more evidence that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist government planned to strip the country’s Muslims of their rights. Tensions peaked in February when sectarian violence and rioting broke out in New Delhi. The vast majority of people killed, hurt or displaced were Muslim, and the police were involved in many of those cases. After Mr. Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in late March to contain the coronavirus, shutting down businesses and ordering all 1.3 billion Indians inside, the protests disbanded. Lawyers said the police then moved to detain demonstrators while skirting complaints against government allies. Among those in custody are a youth activist who raised awareness about police brutality against Muslims; an academic who gave a speech opposing the citizenship law; and Ms. Narwal, a graduate student who co-founded Pinjra Tod, or Break the Cage, a women’s collective that organized some of the largest rallies. Nitika Khaitan, a criminal lawyer, said the crackdown had also pushed beyond higher-profile critics to include ordinary residents of riot-hit neighborhoods. She recently challenged those arrests in a jointly signed letter to the Delhi High Court. Lawyers have tracked a few dozen such arrests under the lockdown, though Ms. Khaitan said the true figure could not be verified because police reports had not been made public. Many detentions were “not in compliance with constitutional mandates,” she said. In a recent interview, Sachidanand Shrivastava, the police chief in New Delhi, said his officers were conducting fair investigations. In May, the authorities said they had detained about 1,300 people for involvement in the protests and riots, including an equal number of Hindus and Muslims. Recently, the police arrested a group of Hindus for forcing nine Muslim men to chant “Hail Lord Ram,” a reference to a Hindu god, before killing them and throwing their bodies into a drain. “It is very important that the police force remain impartial,” Mr. Shrivastava said. “And we are following this principle from Day 1.” But members of India’s judiciary have questioned the official numbers, accusing the police of withholding information about the arrests under national security protections and singling out Muslims for many of the harsher charges. In court proceeding notes reviewed by The Times, a judge hearing a case against a Muslim protester wrote that the police appeared to be targeting only “one end” without probing the “rival faction.” During the riots, the police were accused of abetting Hindus and, in some cases, torturing Muslims. Khalid Saifi, a member of United Against Hate, a group that works with victims of hate crimes, was arrested after he tried to mediate between the police and protesters, according to his lawyers. The police charged him with being a “key conspirator” of the riots. His wife, Nargis Saifi, said he was tortured in custody. “His only crime is he is a Muslim,” she said. M.S. Randhawa, a police spokesman, denied that Mr. Saifi had been tortured, adding that he has regular opportunities to speak to a judge if abuse occurs. “These are just allegations,” Mr. Randhawa said. “He would have told the magistrate if he had been tortured.” But rights advocates accuse Mr. Modi’s government of shielding party officials — and more broadly, of Hindus involved in the violence. Ms. Narwal, who was detained in May, could face at least several years in prison for helping organize demonstrations that blocked a busy road in northeast Delhi, where February’s bloodiest battles between Hindus and Muslims broke out. The police have accused her of playing a leading role in the riots, charging her with murder, attempt to murder and being part of a “criminal conspiracy.” At the same time, the police have been accused of ignoring complaints against Kapil Mishra, a local politician with Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party who gave a fiery speech threatening to remove Ms. Narwal and other protesters forcibly if the authorities did not take action. Hours after the ultimatum, the streets erupted. But charges were never filed against Mr. Mishra, who has denied a role in starting the riots. A New Delhi police superintendent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that some officers had wanted to act against Mr. Mishra, but that they were pressured by the force’s leadership not to touch “the warriors of the government.” “We did not even try,” the superintendent said. “The directions were clear: Don’t lay your hands on him.” Through an intermediary, Mr. Mishra declined to comment. Ms. Narwal’s father, Mahavir Narwal, said the government was moving India closer to authoritarianism and demonizing anybody who questioned its policies. For weeks, prison officials ignored his calls and emails to Tihar Jail, where Ms. Narwal is being held. With coronavirus restrictions in place, she was moved into an isolation ward at one point, where she stayed for 17 days, said Mr. Narwal, a retired scientist. Lately, communication has smoothed out. But Mr. Narwal said the subtext of his daughter’s arrest seemed clear: “If you protest, you will be called a terrorist.” “All she did was fight to keep the soul of India alive,” he said.

"For Women in Afghan Security Forces, a Daily Battle",2020-07-20,By Mujib Mashal and Kiana Hayeri,"['KHOST, Afghanistan — Motivated, educated and fresh from finishing police academy in Turkey, Second Lt. Zala Zazai had stellar qualifications for the job she took in eastern Afghanistan in June. It all mattered little once she started. On social media, she was called a prostitute, and men wrote that her very presence on the force would corrupt Khost Province, where she was posted. Her colleagues at Police Headquarters — where she was the only female officer on a staff of nearly 500 — tried to intimidate her into wearing a conservative head scarf and traditional clothes instead of her uniform, and to hide in back corners of the office away from the public, she said. Shopkeepers arrived at the station’s gates with no other business but to get a look at this novelty. Lieutenant Zazai, 21, came home from her first day feeling sick and frightened. She felt so unsafe that she asked her mother, Spesalai, who had accompanied her from Kabul, to stay with her at a shelter deep inside Police Headquarters. At night, the two women locked the door. During the day, Lieutenant Zazai scrambled to expedite the paperwork for a pistol. “I want to have something to defend myself with,” she said. Helping Afghan women, who were banished to their homes by the Taliban during their government in the 1990s, became a rallying cry for Western involvement in Afghanistan after the U.S. invasion in 2001. Two decades later, the rise of a generation of educated, professional Afghan women is an undeniable sign of change. Now, with the possibility of power-sharing talks opening between the Taliban and the Afghan government, many women are worried that the strides they have made are at risk. What adds to their concern is how fragile the gains remain after two decades, where every mundane step is still a daily battle. Even after more than a billion dollars spent on women’s empowerment projects, the daily reality for women trying to break into public roles — particularly with the government and the security forces — remains bleak. Women are still almost completely absent in high-level meetings where decisions of war, peace and politics are made. Work for women at routine jobs is a daily barrage of harassment, insult and abuse. Among the police forces, which have been the focus of diversification efforts for years, women still make up only 2.8 percent of employees — and that is the highest level in 18 years. Most of those 3,800 women are in hidden roles with little contact with the public, officials acknowledged. Only five of the total of about 200 military and civilian leadership positions at the Interior Ministry are occupied by women. For much of the past two decades, the task of including women in the police force often fell on former warlords and commanders whose beliefs about women differed only slightly from the Taliban’s, if at all. President Ashraf Ghani has increased the number of female ambassadors, introduced female deputy governors and ministers, and sent female deputies to the ministries of defense and interior. But Afghan society remains deeply patriarchal, and the few women who have risen to such positions face many difficulties. The strategy to include more women at less senior positions has been mostly to spend money and meet modest quotas. In the past six years, the Afghan government and its Western allies have spent more than $100 million on building facilities to support Afghan women in the security forces. In Nangarhar Province, they spent $6 million on a training facility for female police officers that remains unused three years after completion. After repeated failures, recruitment efforts essentially boiled down to bribing women to join the force and stay. A woman’s incentives to join the police include eight more benefits than her male counterparts, according to Hosna Jalil, the deputy minister of interior. On several occasions, women of retirement age were allowed to fake their IDs and lower their age to stay on the force, she said. Still, the goal of a 5 percent female presence in the police forces has never been met. “Every province I have gone to, the first thing I say is that you are a force that is only working for men — not for women or children, the two most vulnerable categories who are left behind,” Ms. Jalil said. It is not because qualified, willing women are lacking. It is because to join the police is to endure abuse and degradation. Over the years, sexual harassment had been rampant in the security forces, with reports that the wives of officers killed in line of duty were harassed when they came to collect death benefits. The perception that female police officers were frequently harassed meant that women who were victims of domestic violence and other crimes dared not visit police stations. “If only we had guaranteed a father that the dignity of your daughter is more protected in the ranks of the police because she has authority and professionalism here,” Ms. Jalil said. “We haven’t been able to create that mentality.” Among those who endured years of mistreatment to follow her dream of rising in the security forces is Capt. Rahima Ataee, a 13-year veteran of the Afghan police special forces who now serves as the uniformed secretary to Ms. Jalil in the Interior Ministry. Captain Ataee’s father, a retired police colonel, admitted her to the police academy, and her physical endurance qualified her for the special forces. She spent weeks at a time on the front lines in provinces under attack by the Taliban. But at the mere question of how her male colleagues treated her in the field, she broke down. She said the bullying and abuse was such that “I developed mental problems.” She would not tell her father at the time, she said, because she thought it would break his heart and lead him to prevent her from working. Every time she complained about the work environment after returning from a mission, she said, she would often get the same answer: “Well, you are getting paid.” Before Ms. Jalil began her job as the deputy minister for strategy and policy — hired by Mr. Ghani to be fresh eyes in an institution long seen as corrupt and dysfunctional — she had to fight for acceptance. Generals walked out of meetings when they found out she was in charge. Subordinates often fed her wrong information to undermine her. “I often have to say I am not the head of the gender department — I am the policy and strategy deputy to the minister of interior. I work for this large force that is both male and female,” Ms. Jalil said. “I may have a female outlook, but any woman who comes should come for their expertise, not for them being a woman.” These days, despite frequent sexist attacks on social media, Ms. Jalil says she has found her footing as part of a leadership team that is working to reform the police. They spend long hours in a quiet basement office poring over charts of a bloated structure that they are trimming, and have removed unnecessary bureaucratic steps that created opportunities for corruption. They are trying to hold the officers to new standards of accountability, and to better care for the families of tens of thousands of police officers killed in decades of war. Lieutenant Zazai, who serves at the Police Headquarters in Khost, grew up in Kabul, the capital. Her mother has been the head of their household for seven years, and although her male relatives were opposed, she, her older sister, and her mother attended after-hours university classes financed with their own day jobs. Another sister is a student of Islamic studies. She and her older sister are now both police officers. But they were only willing to take the first step when the opportunity to train in Turkey came up because of concerns about harassment and abuse in the local training academies. The signs of the difficulty ahead were clear when the women arrived at the Police Headquarters in Khost to obtain signatures needed for their applications and an officer castigated them for wanting to join the force. “What kind of a mother are you, bringing your young, unmarried daughters to become police?” Spesalai Zazai recalled one of the officers telling her. After starting her job in June, Lieutenant Zazai found a difficult and lonely environment. At the time, she was the only professional female officer in Khost. On her first day, she was catcalled by her fellow officers. Those at her office tried to convince her that it was better for her to work in conservative Islamic garb than to wear a uniform. When she insisted,  they found a new tack: She should wear a mask, even though her colleagues did not. The pretext was Covid-19, the intention was covering her. For the first two weeks, Lieutenant Zazai would spend her days at work, and in the evening she would retreat to the government guesthouse where her mother kept her company. She hadn’t faced a direct physical threat, she said, but she was aware of the reality, and her lack of a weapon added to her vulnerability. She was devastated when her mother had to go back to Kabul, but Lieutenant Zazai is trying to make a go of it in Khost. “May God make it easier,” she said. “But I have to find the strength — because it can’t go on like this, women should claim their place. I know if I spend a year here, it will make a difference.” Farooq Jan Mangal contributed reporting from Khost, and Zabihullah Ghazi from Nangarhar, Afghanistan.']",
Three Coronavirus Vaccine Developers Report Promising Initial Results,2020-07-20,By David D. Kirkpatrick,"['LONDON — The race for a vaccine against the coronavirus intensified on Monday as three competing laboratories released promising results from early trials in humans. Now comes the hard part: proving that any of the vaccines protects against the virus, and establishing how much immunity they provide — and for how long. “What this means is that each of these vaccines is worth taking all the way through to a Phase III study,” said Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, a vaccine researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine. “That is it. All it means is ‘worth pursuing.’” Phase III trials test how well a drug works. Two of the vaccine developers — the first, a partnership between Oxford University and the British-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca; the second, the Chinese company CanSino Biologics — published their early results as peer-reviewed studies in The Lancet, a British medical journal. A joint venture between the drug giant Pfizer and the German company BioNTech shared results online before peer review, and invited comparisons to the biotech company Moderna, which uses a similar technology and released early results last week. All the developers that released results on Monday said their vaccines had produced strong immune responses with only minor side effects. “They all look really good,” said Prof. Stacey Schultz-Cherry of the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, arguing that more than one vaccine would be necessary to address the needs of varying demographic groups. All of the developers asserted that their vaccines elicited antibody levels similar to those seen in patients who have recovered from Covid-19. But scientists cautioned that the antibody responses in convalescing patients varied widely, and that even matching those responses did not necessarily guarantee any degree of immunity. “It does not really tell you whether the vaccine is going to protect,” said Prof. John P. Moore of Weill Cornell Medical College. The developers who announced their early results Monday all indicated that any immunity was likely to require a second, booster dose of its vaccine. The partnership between Oxford and AstraZeneca may be the most closely watched vaccine effort. The United States, Britain and several other governments and nonprofit groups have already agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a total of two billion doses even before the vaccine’s efficacy has been proven. And British and American officials believe Russia sought to spy on the Oxford research. It was also the first vaccine to enter Phase III trials. More than 10,000 participants in Britain, Brazil and South Africa have already received doses. Another Phase III test involving 30,000 participants in the United States is set to begin next week, along with a parallel test of the Moderna vaccine. The Oxford study released on Monday analyzed a few hundred participants who had received the vaccine in an earlier safety trial. Of those, only 10 received a booster shot, and they showed the most promising immune response. “There is still a long way to go,” said Prof. Sarah Gilbert of Oxford, who is leading development of the vaccine. The CanSino vaccine, tested in a trial of about 500 participants in China, appeared least likely to be effective, based on the early results released so far, scientists said. “Pretty weak compared to other vaccine candidates (to the extent that comparisons are possible),” Professor Moore noted in a summary of the results. Both the Oxford and CanSino vaccines work by altering the genes of another common virus — the adenovirus — so that it harmlessly mimics the coronavirus and induces an immune response. The Oxford vaccine exploits an adenovirus found in chimps; humans do not already have antibodies against it. The CanSino vaccine, on the other hand, travels on the back of a widespread adenovirus that causes the common cold in humans, and so pre-existing defenses against that adenovirus in many people appear to thwart the vaccine, scientists said. The preliminary results released Monday by the Pfizer-BioNTech partnership, based on a trial with 60 participants in Germany at various dosage levels, appeared able to produce a strong immune response. The vaccine uses the same kind of specially engineered genetic material, mRNA, as the Moderna vaccine, and the early results from Pfizer-BioNTech may suggest an even stronger immune response, scientists said. But the scientists cautioned that no response in a lab test guarantees that a vaccine will prevent a disease. And comparing the immune responses ascribed to the various vaccines is almost impossible because the reports are not standardized. “It’s like judging a beautiful baby photo contest when every mom uses a different Instagram filter,” Professor Moore said. What’s more, none of the trials has been able to measure results over more than a few weeks, raising questions about the longer term effects of the vaccines. Professor Hotez argued that the eagerness of vaccine developers to promote such inconclusive results may actually undermine more immediate public health efforts to control the virus, like wearing masks and social distancing. “All the hype makes it seem like a miracle is around the corner,” he said, “and that is just not the case. This is not going to be a quick fix. This is going to take years to sort out.” Carl Zimmer contributed reporting.']","Early trials showed a good immune response in vaccinated subjects, but one researcher sounded a note of caution: “There is still a long way to go.”"
Five Takeaways From the Report on Russia’s Interference in Britain,2020-07-21,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — A long-awaited report into Russian influence in Britain was finally published on Tuesday, painting a damning picture of the failure of successive British governments to combat a series of threats and interference in its affairs, ranging from disinformation to the purchase of influence. The British took their eye off the ball and are still playing catch up, the report revealed, concluding that Britain was one of Moscow’s top intelligence targets amid growing diplomatic tensions between the two nations. As Kevan Jones, a member of Parliament who served on the intelligence committee that released the report, said on Tuesday, Russian interference in Britain “is the new normal,” and a major overhaul is needed to counter Moscow’s destabilization efforts in the future. Here are some of the main takeaways of the report. According to the report, intelligence agencies ignored threats from Russian interference that they should have seen coming. No one agency seems to have been responsible for protecting Britain’s democratic process during a series of high profile votes and the report said that it was “surprisingly difficult to establish who has responsibility for” that. Much of the Russian interference took place in the open — occurring through disinformation — and that meant that it was not the top focus of spy agencies and was partly the responsibility of other government officials. The intelligence community avoided it because it did not want to get involved in domestic politics. They regarded questions about Russian influence in the Brexit referendum as a “hot potato.” But in hanging back, they may have made life easier for Moscow. The report did not show that Russia meddled to any significant extent in the 2016 Brexit vote that prompted Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union — nor did Russia influence the final outcome. But it suggests that no one in the British government ever really asked the question while the campaign was underway — or even after it — despite evidence of meddling. It notes that open source studies pointed to Russia’s use of bots and trolls to misinform, as well as pro-Brexit and anti-European Union articles on Russian foreign language media outlets. But when the intelligence committee requested information from the domestic intelligence service, MI5, about Russian interference in the referendum, M15 had little to offer. Its initial response was just six lines of text. Two years before the Brexit vote, Scotland held a referendum in which it opted to remain part of the United Kingdom. According to the report there was “credible open source commentary” suggesting that Russia attempted to influence the referendum in 2014. Some commentators suggested that this was the “first post-Soviet Russian interference in a western democratic process,” the inquiry said.  Another strand of Russian influence in Britain comes from hard cash. Britain has welcomed oligarchs and allowed them to recycle their cash through “Londongrad,” as the capital has been dubbed, where rich Russians are well integrated in the business and social scene. A large network of lawyers, accountants and real estate agents became wittingly or unwittingly de facto agents of the Russian state, the report found. And Russia’s influence extended to the highest levels of companies in Britain. Even political figures, including some members of the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber of Parliament, are in some respects on Moscow’s payroll thanks to business interests linked to Russia. Some work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state. The inquiry was produced by Parliament’s intelligence and security committee, a group of senior lawmakers whose job it is to oversee Britain’s spy agencies. But the report was completed more than a year and a half ago. So why was its release delayed until Tuesday? The report, which paints the government in a particularly unflattering light, was sent to Downing Street last year, but its release was delayed until after a general election in December that gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson a big majority. Then publication was held up again amid haggling over the membership of the committee which had to be reconstituted after the election.']",A report released on Tuesday depicts the failure of successive British governments to combat Russian interference despite ample evidence of meddling.
"Three Decades After His Coup, Sudan’s Former Ruler Is Held to Account",2020-07-21,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — Three decades ago, a little-known army officer named Omar Hassan al-Bashir seized power in Sudan, ushering in a long period of brutal rule that would push the sprawling African country into a series of destabilizing wars, cripple its economy and result in humiliating international isolation. Now Mr. al-Bashir is being called to account for his actions. The autocrat, 76, who was ousted last year following street protests, was led into a courtroom in Khartoum on Tuesday to stand trial for his role in the bloodless 1989 coup that toppled the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi. Also in the dock were 27 of Mr. al-Bashir’s most senior officials, including former vice-presidents, ministers, governors and military officers. Mr. al-Bashir, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment last year on separate corruption charges, faces the death penalty if convicted. Armed policemen wielding batons and tear gas canisters stood guard outside the courthouse, where the accused were led into cages for a brief hearing. Dozens of relatives gathered outside the building, jeering and shouting slogans including “God is great!” The prosecution is a rare instance of a dictator being forced to answer for the putsch that catapulted him to power — even if in Mr. al-Bashir’s case, a key accomplice has already evaded justice. The Islamist cleric Hassan al-Turabi, widely seen as the true architect of the 1989 coup, and the power behind Mr. al-Bashir for many years until they had a falling out, died in 2016 without facing trial. For Mr. al-Bashir, this is one prosecution among many. During last year’s corruption trial, he admitted taking $90 million in bribes from Saudi Arabia’s rulers. But the gravest charges have yet to come before a court. For over a decade, the International Criminal Court at The Hague has sought Mr. al-Bashir over his role in the conflict in the western region of Darfur, where Sudanese troops and allied militias killed, pillaged and raped in a yearslong campaign of ethnically driven violence that resulted in several hundred thousand deaths. The Hague court indicted Mr. al-Bashir a decade ago on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, and charged other senior figures including the former defense minister, Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein, who stood trial alongside Mr. al-Bashir on Tuesday. Although Sudan’s transitional government, which is jointly led by civilian and military leaders, indicated earlier this year that it was ready to send Mr. al-Bashir to The Hague, there has been little sign of that happening. Instead, the new administration has appeared to shy away from a trial on Darfur, probably because its own leaders might also face accusations. Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, a powerful figure in the transitional government, leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a group linked to some of the worst atrocity accusations in Darfur. When Mr. al-Bashir, a brigade commander, took over in 1989, the country was sinking into decline. The army was battling a tenacious uprising in the south, and Mr. al-Mahdi’s elected government was unpopular and beleaguered. After he seized power, Mr. al-Bashir suspended the Parliament and other state institutions, closed Khartoum airport and announced the coup over the radio. Later, he embarked on a vicious purge of potential rivals, imposed Islamic law, and introduced harsh laws that severely restricted freedoms for Sudanese, especially for women. It quickly became clear that the ideological drive for the putsch came from a small group of Islamists led by Mr. al-Turabi, an erudite, Sorbonne-educated cleric who dreamed of leading a Pan-Arab Islamist renaissance. Mr. al-Bashir had a reputation as a malleable, less sophisticated figure. “Bashir was the frontman but the Islamists were more powerful,” said Alex de Waal, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and an expert on Sudan. “They manipulated him.” But Mr. al-Bashir outwitted the ideologues in a series of power struggles that ended with Mr. Turabi’s imprisonment in 1999, leaving Mr. al-Bashir as Sudan’s unchallenged ruler. Sudan was home to Osama bin Laden until 1996, when under American pressure Mr. al-Bashir was forced to expel the Qaeda leader. Later, Mr. al-Bashir softened his Islamist fervor in favor of repairing relations with Sudan’s neighbors and, in 2005, striking a landmark peace deal with southern rebels that led to independence for South Sudan in 2011. Mr. al-Bashir’s iron grip collapsed in April 2019 when, after months of street protests triggered by the price of bread, his own army lieutenants decided his rule had become untenable and ousted him from power. Mr. al-Bashir has dismissed the charges over the 1989 coup as politically motivated — “a political trial par excellence,” one of his lawyers told reporters in December — and footage of Tuesday’s proceedings broadcast on state TV focused on the judge and did not show the ousted autocrat in the packed courtroom. For many Sudanese, though, it was also striking to see the former vice presidents Ali Osman Taha and Bakri Hassan Saleh on trial. Without hearing statements or arguments, the judge adjourned the trial until Aug. 11, when he said it would reconvene in a larger courtroom with more space for relatives and the defendants.']","Omar Hassan al-Bashir, ousted in mass protests last year, is on trial for his role in the military coup that propelled him to power in 1989.

"With Tourists Gone, Bali Workers Return to Farms and Fishing",2020-07-20,By Nyimas Laula and Richard C. Paddock,"['LALANGLINGGAH VILLAGE, Indonesia — Ni Nyoman Ayu Sutaryani, a mother of three, made a steady living for two decades working as a masseuse and yoga instructor at Bali’s luxury hotels and spas. Now at 37 she finds herself back on the farm of her childhood village here, standing precariously at the top of a tall bamboo ladder, picking cloves. It is not the life that Ms. Ayu had imagined for herself. But on Bali, which depends heavily on tourism, she is one of thousands of workers who have been forced by the coronavirus pandemic to return to their villages and traditional ways of making a living. “This is my first time being jobless, and sometimes I want to cry,” Ms. Ayu said. “Everything is returning to the old time. That’s what we have to do rather than starving.” Like Ms. Ayu, many have returned to their family farms, helping to plant and harvest crops. Others feed their families by digging for clams in shallow Benoa Bay or by casting fishing lines out to sea from one of Bali’s deserted beaches. In a sign of how far the economy of the Indonesian island has declined, some rural residents have turned to bartering fruit and vegetables so that they can save their limited cash to buy necessities. Bali, with a population of 4.4 million and eight times the physical size of Singapore, is Indonesia’s tourism engine, boasting spectacular beaches, terraced rice fields, scenic temples and ideal weather. Largely Hindu in a predominantly Muslim nation, Bali carved out its own identity as a tourist destination decades ago and was once widely viewed from abroad as an independent country. Hoping to capitalize on the Bali name, the central government began a campaign last year to create 10 “new Bali” destinations. More than half of Bali’s economy depends directly on tourism, and a quarter is engaged in tourism-related activities, such as transporting visitors and supplying food to hotels and restaurants. Last year, Bali attracted more than six million tourists from abroad and 10 million from Indonesia. The number of hotels keeps growing; some international chains operate more than two dozen. President Trump has gotten in on the act, partnering with a politically connected billionaire to build a Trump-branded hotel and golf resort. The economy has suffered through other disasters: the 2002 Bali bombing, the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2017 eruption of the Mount Agung volcano. But the coronavirus outbreak has been the most devastating. In March, Indonesia banned foreign visitors from the worst-hit countries and, weeks later, extended the ban to all foreign tourists. In May, the government banned domestic tourists from traveling to Bali, although officials and business travelers with a negative coronavirus test were allowed. Nevertheless, Indonesia has surpassed China in the number of cases to become the country hit hardest in East Asia, with more than 88,000 cases and 4,200 deaths as of Monday. On Bali, the number of cases has doubled, to 2,781, and deaths have quadrupled, to 44, in a little more than three weeks. The travel restrictions have slammed Bali’s tourism industry. During the first half of the year, the island received 1.1 million foreign tourists, almost all of them before the pandemic. That was a drop from nearly 2.9 million during the same period last year. Comparative figures for domestic tourists were not available. Impatient to revive the economy, Bali’s governor, I Wayan Koster, began gradually reopening the island this month, including restaurants and popular beaches. He hopes to bring back domestic tourists to Bali starting next week and attract foreign tourists beginning Sept. 11. For a generation, young people have been drawn from villages in northern Bali to work in the tourist centers, mainly in southern Bali. Many attend tourism vocational schools before taking jobs in hotels, restaurants and tour agencies. “Tourism has become the dominant work for most people,” said Ricky Putra, chairman of the Bali Hotels Association. The pandemic has forced hotels and other tourist facilities to lay off some workers and cut the pay and hours of others. Larger hotels have kept skeleton staffs on duty, rotating workers in for a week or two at a time, while allowing them to make a little money and return to their villages. “Mostly they are going back to their villages,” said Mr. Ricky, who is also general manager of the Santrian Resorts and Villas hotel group. “Some of them can use this very challenging time to help their parents and go back to their village farming or fishing.” One local leader, Dewa Komang Yudi, said he welcomed the return of tourism workers to his community, Tembok Village, in far northern Bali. He said that about 400 unemployed workers — waiters, spa employees, drivers and cook’s helpers — had returned to the village of 7,000 and were growing food on land that had been fallow for lack of workers. He hopes many will stay permanently. “Deurbanization suddenly occurred because of the pandemic,” he said. “There are more people now in north Bali than in south Bali because many of them returned to their villages. This is what we have been dreaming about.” Mr. Yudi, 33, who himself attended a tourism academy and used to work as a hotel butler, said Bali should devote more resources to farming, a more sustainable enterprise. Instead, it has become overly reliant on tourism. “People are depending on it like opium,” he said. “Tourism is fragile, and we have gone too far. We have been abandoning the fundamental things that mobilize the economy.” Across the island, some communities give food aid to the unemployed, such as rice, instant noodles, cooking oil and sugar. But recipients say it is not enough to live on. Many also have debts, like installment payments for motorbikes, a common mode of transportation on the island. At Benoa Bay, on the southern end of the island, low tide attracts dozens of people from villages nearby to dig for clams, using rakes made of scrap wood, nails or even their bare hands and feet. On a good day, one can collect more than a pound of clams. Some also hunt for small crabs using a wooden stick with two iron hooks that are bent like fingers. If their families are lucky enough to have traditional boats, known as a jukung, they go out to sea and catch shrimp. Kadek Merta, 34, who was digging for clams recently, said he had been a hotel steward but had not worked since March. “I feel hollow,” he said. “There is no job. I can only survive by depending on the sea.” Agung Yoga, 39, a junior chef, said he used to fish as a hobby along Bali’s southern beaches, sometimes wading out into the surf. But now, unemployed for the first time, he is fishing as a matter of survival for himself and his family. “If this situation continues until next year, I am hopeless,” he said. “Maybe we won’t be able to eat.” Ms. Ayu — whose sister, brother, uncles, nephews and cousins all work in tourism — preferred working as a masseuse, because she earned a decent income and it was easier. Harvesting cloves in Lalanglinggah Village from the tops of trees that grow more than 60 feet tall can be hazardous. But living in the village, on the southwestern coast of Bali, a few miles from the sea, has its advantages, too. From the top of a homemade ladder, Ms. Ayu could see the beach and the forest, and feel a gentle breeze flowing in from the Bali Strait. “I feel serene,” she said during a break in picking. “In the city, it is crowded. Having this activity calms my mind.” More important, the return to traditional village life has reunited relatives who usually see one another only on important holidays. “I earn more working in tourism,” Ms. Ayu said. “But on the positive side, God has given us this situation so we can be with our families.” Nyimas Laula reported from Lalanglinggah Village, Indonesia, and Richard C. Paddock from Bangkok.

German Arts Advocate Kidnapped in Baghdad,2020-07-21,By Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"['BAGHDAD — Kidnappers in two vehicles seized a German arts advocate at dusk on Monday as she was leaving her office near one of Baghdad’s busiest thoroughfares, Iraqi security officials said. The advocate, Hella Mewis, was a well-known figure in the neighborhood, home to the Beit Tarkib Arts Center, which she had established with Iraqi artists to encourage and showcase their work. Ms. Mewis was also active last fall in supporting anti-government protesters, whose ranks included many intellectuals and artists. Scores of anti-government protesters were kidnapped during the demonstrations last fall and winter, which the United Nations human rights division documented in a recent report, suggesting that armed groups operating outside of government control were responsible. Originally from Berlin, Ms. Mewis went to Iraq in 2010 with the Goethe Institute, an organization that promotes German language and culture around the world, according to an article in the journal International Politics. Ms. Mewis, 45, said she was impressed by the deep interest that young Iraqis had in the arts. “In Europe the art scene is saturated, everything has been done before,” she was quoted as saying, “but I can make a difference in Iraq.” Her openness and energy attracted a number of young Iraqis into the arts and she made many friends, said Thekra Sarsam, who runs a nongovernmental organization in Baghdad. “Her Tarkib organization always supported the youth protests, and their voice and artistic work was always supportive of the demonstrations,” Ms. Sarsam said. Artists covered the walls of central Baghdad and the area around Tahrir Square with protest murals last fall that combined art and politics, often with a dose of humor. “I got in touch with her more than a week ago,” Ms. Sarsam added, “and she was concerned after the assassination of Hisham al-Hashimi.” Mr. al-Hashimi, a security analyst and researcher on Iraqi armed groups, was killed on July 7. Like Ms. Mewis, he supported the protesters who started the anti-corruption demonstrations in October. Ms. Sarsam said she and Ms. Mewis had discussed security conditions in the wake of Mr. al-Hashimi’s killing. “I said the situation is not good, and everyone is under threat,” Ms. Sarsam recalled. Ms. Mewis frequently rode her bicycle to and from the Beit Tarkib Arts Center in the Karada neighborhood, a mixed area of Shiites, Sunnis and Christians. The German Foreign Ministry confirmed that Ms. Mewis had been taken and said that it had set up a crisis unit to help respond. Iraqi security forces also set up a team to search for her and the abductors, said Gen. Saad Maan, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. “Hella is a dear friend of ours and earned the respect and appreciation of many Iraqis; she has worked a lot for Iraq,” General Maan said. Iraqi human rights advocates condemned the kidnapping. “Hella Mewis’s kidnapping is a serious indication of the inability of the Iraqi government and security forces to protect foreign nationals in Iraq who provide continuous humanitarian and cultural services to the Iraqi people, who need them most, “ said Ali al-Bayati, a member of the High Commission for Human Rights in Iraq. Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.']","Hella Mewis started an arts center in the Iraqi capital, and supported anti-government protesters last fall. It was not clear who abducted her."
Spain’s Reopening Stumbles as Virus Cases Rise Among Young People,2020-07-23,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — After already enjoying a long night of graduation celebrations, a throng of young people poured into the Babylon discothèque at 5 a.m. to continue partying in the southern Spanish city of Córdoba. Two weeks later, 91 people linked to the Babylon’s 400 identified partygoers have tested positive for the coronavirus and the regional authorities are still struggling to trace all those who entered the club that night, or who later came into contact with them. Spain lifted a nationwide state of emergency on June 21 as it emerged from a strict three-month lockdown imposed to gain control over one of Europe’s worst outbreaks. The rapid spread of the virus in Spain left some 28,400 people dead by the official count — almost surely understated — with most of them over the age of 70. Since then, new coronavirus cases have quadrupled — now concentrated among young people — as the left-wing coalition government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez returned responsibility for a safe reopening to Spain’s regions. That has made Spain a mosaic of new rules — some less stringent or more loosely enforced than others — and an uneven patchwork of successes mixed with alarming failures. The country is now grappling with 224 local outbreaks, Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa, told Parliament on Wednesday. Several other European countries, from Portugal to Germany, have faced significant local outbreaks after coming out of lockdown, but most of those were more limited in scale and snuffed out relatively quickly. Authorities isolated pockets of new cases and traced those who may have been exposed. The resurgence in Spain has underscored not only the need for vigilance as societies reopen, but also for supporting measures like additional testing and contact tracing — steps that Spain remains ill equipped to carry out. The result is that hundreds of thousands of people in various parts of the country have been forced to return to temporary lockdowns, notably in the northeastern region of Catalonia, an area especially hard-hit before. But public tolerance for new lockdowns may prove lower than in March and April, when the nationwide quarantines were largely obeyed but only grudgingly accepted. Young people in particular are chafing at the restrictions, especially because they are less likely to become gravely ill as a result of infection. While the demographic shift toward young people has reduced the risk that Spain’s health care sector will once more get saturated with Covid-19 patients, as happened in late March, it has raised a new concern about asymptomatic transmissions, which make the need for testing all the more pressing. Yet health experts are warning that Spain continues to fall short in terms of testing for Covid-19. “Spain should now design a specific strategy to identify asymptomatic patients,” Helena Legido-Quigley, an associate professor of public health at the University of Singapore. Overall, she added, “testing capacity and contact tracing could be much improved” in Spain. Mr. Illa, Spain’s health minister, warned recently that his Socialist-led coalition government was ready to reactivate Spain’s state of emergency if it became clear that regions were not able to control the latest outbreaks. But Mr. Illa forms parts of a fragile minority government that has faced fierce criticism from opposition parties over the government’s response to the pandemic. This week, María Jesús Montero, the minister who is the government’s spokeswoman, sent a special message of caution to “people who are younger, because some of the outbreaks are linked to the behavior in nightlife venues or places where a large number of people gather.” In the case of Catalonia, which has had one of the worst resurgences of the virus, the situation has been complicated by disagreement between politicians and local judges over who has the authority to put people back under lockdown. Last week, the Catalan regional leader, Quim Torra, urged, rather than ordered, about three million people living around Barcelona to stay indoors and “demonstrate that we are a society of solidarity.” Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Many people ignored Mr. Torra’s recommendation, however, and the local police were even forced to close some of Barcelona’s packed beaches over the weekend because of the risk of infection. While the most serious outbreaks have recently occurred in northeastern Spain, only two of Spain’s 17 regions — Madrid and the Canary Islands — have not reimposed requirements to wear face masks at all times outdoors. Enforcement has proved to be complicated, not only at outdoor gatherings but also in places like nightclubs that have been allowed to reopen under occupancy limits. In Córdoba, there are conflicting accounts of what happened in the Babylon club, which was restricted to 40 percent of its 500-person capacity to allow social distancing. Regional officials say they have identified about 400 people who went to the club that night, though its management has insisted that no more than 140 were inside at any one moment. The club is now closed while an investigation continues. Some regions of Spain are reporting a particularly strong uptick in the number of cases among adolescents. In the northern region of Aragón, where authorities said this week that they could contain the outbreaks without a return to lockdown, the rate of infection rose sevenfold in one month among people tested between ages 10 and 19. Some recent outbreaks have been linked to vulnerable sectors of society, notably seasonal fruit pickers in northeastern Spain, who are often migrant workers. In recent days, Spanish hoteliers and travel operators have reported more booking cancellations since the new outbreaks and lockdowns were announced. The latest outbreaks could threaten cross-border travel in Europe, at a time when some tourism destinations are already suffering because airlines have only reopened some of their routes. Last week, Jean Castex, the new French prime minister, said his government was monitoring the situation in neighboring Catalonia to decide whether France’s border with Spain should be kept open. On Wednesday, Reyes Maroto, the Spanish tourism minister, urged France not to close the border. “We are cohabiting with the virus, but this does not mean that we cannot travel and recover some kind of normalcy,” Ms. Maroto told a conference in Madrid.']","Covid-19 outbreaks are putting Spain back under pressure, but this time the focus is on younger people and the risk that they are unwittingly spreading the virus."
Canadian Court Says Asylum Treaty With U.S. Is Unconstitutional,2020-07-22,By Dan Bilefsky,"['MONTREAL — A Canadian court has ruled that a treaty with the United States that allows Canada to turn away asylum-seekers coming from the United States if they originally entered there from a third country violates Canada’s constitution. Human-rights advocates have long criticized the pact, saying it tacitly encourages asylum-seekers to circumvent Canada’s official land borders because if they try to enter at an official crossing, they will be refused entry and returned to the United States, subject to some exceptions. In a case brought by several refugee advocate groups as well as by individual asylum-seekers, the Federal Court of Canada in Ottawa ruled that the bilateral pact, the Safe Third Country Agreement, breached Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the right to “liberty” and “security.” In a more than 60-page ruling, Justice Ann Marie McDonald cited the conditions asylum-seekers said they had faced while in detention in the United States, including lack of access to adequate health care or legal counsel. She cited the example of Nedira Jemal Mustefa, a Muslim woman from Ethiopia and a litigant in the case, who testified that she had been forced to eat pork in contravention of Muslim dietary laws. She also was held in solitary confinement for one week at the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York State, describing the facility as “freezing cold.” She told the court her experience had been “terrifying, isolating and psychologically traumatic.” In her ruling, the judge wrote that “Canada cannot turn a blind eye to the consequences that befell Ms. Mustefa in its efforts to adhere to” the treaty. Among the groups bringing the court challenge were Amnesty International and the Canadian Council for Refugees. Mary-Liz Power, a spokeswoman for Canada’s Minister of Public Safety, said the ministry was reviewing the court’s decision, which does not become effective until Jan. 22. The Canadian government has six months to respond to the ruling and can appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. If the ruling is overturned, the litigants could potentially appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Canadian proponents of the treaty argue that it is an effective means to control the border and that the agreement was entered into on the basis that the asylum systems of both Canada and the United States meet the necessary level of protection for asylum-seekers under international law. Karen Musalo, a professor of law at the University of California, Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, who testified on behalf of those making the legal challenge, called the decision an “indictment of the inhumanity of the American detention system for asylum-seekers.” Justin Mohammed, a law and policy adviser at Amnesty International Canada, said the legal case was part of a longstanding effort to press Canada to recognize that the human rights of asylum-seekers were being violated in the United States, a situation, he said, that had worsened amid the anti-refugee ethos of the Trump administration. He added that the decision was all the more important during a global pandemic when overcrowding in American detention centers posed an even greater risk to the health and security of asylum-seekers. “The court decision throws cold water on the idea that when Canada returned refugees to the United States that they will be treated with respect for their dignity and human rights,” Mr. Mohammed said.']",The treaty has long been criticized by human-rights advocates who said it tacitly encouraged asylum-seekers to circumvent Canada’s official land borders.
Prince Philip Steps Out of Retirement for Military Handover,2020-07-22,By Iliana Magra,"['LONDON — Prince Philip, the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain who officially retired from public life in 2017, briefly stepped back into his life of royal duty on Wednesday for a military ceremony at Windsor Castle, where he handed over a role he has held for nearly seven decades. Philip handed the keys of Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifles, a merger of four infantry regiments that was formed in 2007 and is now the largest infantry regiment in the British army, to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, amid the sounds of bugles. But like so many things during the time of coronavirus, the ceremony was reimagined to allow for social distancing, with Prince Philip officially handing over the position at Windsor Castle, some 85 miles from where the Duchess later took up the duty in a ceremony at Highgrove House.  Prince Philip, officially known as the Duke of Edinburgh, was saluted and thanked for his 67 years of service to The Rifles and their forming regiments by Major General Tom Copinger-Symes, the assistant colonel commandant. The prince was first appointed Colonel-in-Chief of The Wiltshire Regiment, one of the groups that now make up the The Rifles, in 1953. A short time later, The Rifles’ Colonel Commandant, General Sir Patrick Sanders, welcomed Camilla to her new role at Highgrove House in Gloucestershire. Prince Philip has been mostly out of the public eye since 2017, when he announced his retirement. He has for years been dealing with health issues — he was taken to the hospital in London in December to treat a pre-existing condition, and underwent hip surgery in 2018. He also drew headlines when at 97 he got into a car accident while driving near his country home, igniting debate about whether he should be behind the wheel at all. He has been married to the queen since 1947, and the pair have been isolating at Windsor Castle since the start of the coronavirus lockdown. Since that time, they have been rarely seen, though they were pictured together there last week during the surprise wedding of their granddaughter Princess Beatrice. The queen also held her first public engagement since the pandemic began when she knighted Sir Tom Moore — better known as Captain Tom — at the castle on Friday.']","The Duke of Edinburgh made a rare appearance from retirement on Wednesday to hand the keys of a ceremonial military role over to his daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall."
Trial Begins in Germany Over Synagogue Attack on Yom Kippur,2020-07-21,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — A young German man charged with killing two people last fall after his plan to blast his way into a synagogue filled with Jews observing Yom Kippur failed, told a court on Tuesday that he was inspired by the white supremacist who had killed 51 worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand earlier last year. Stephan Balliet, 28, is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of a 40-year-old woman, who spoke up as Mr. Balliet planted explosives around the entrance to the synagogue in the eastern city of Halle, and a 20-year-old man he thought was a Muslim. He is also charged with 68 counts of attempted murder and other crimes for the attack last Oct. 9. If convicted of murder, Mr. Balliet faces life in prison. The attack raised alarm that even Germany, a country that prides itself on its culture of humility and atonement for the crimes of the Nazis, is not immune to the international influence of far-right extremism and white supremacy that has incited rampages from New Zealand, to Pittsburgh. In 2019, crimes against Jews in Germany reached their highest level since the country started tracking them in 2001. Mr. Balliet was flown to the courtroom in Magdeburg hours before the trial opened. He wore a protective vest and jeans, and his hands and feet were in handcuffs and shackles similar to those of defendants who’ve faced terrorism charges. The trial had been moved from a smaller court in Naumburg to accommodate all of the participants and the news media. Dressed all in black, his face largely expressionless, Mr. Balliet at first gave only curt responses when the presiding judge, Ursula Mertens, pressed him for details about his past, his family and his personal life, German media reported. “That’s not important,” he responded again and again. What was important to him was the year 2015, when Germany welcomed more than one million refugees. He said that was when he decided to turn his back on a society he described as “infiltrated” by Muslims and Black people, whom he used a racist slur to describe, eliciting a rebuke from Judge Mertens. “I will not accept the verbal abuse of people in this courtroom and have the authority to remove you,” she told him. “I will not tolerate further crimes in the courtroom by you slandering people.” The racist slurs and derogatory language Mr. Balliet repeatedly sought to use echoed the hateful rants denouncing feminists and immigrants heard on a video he made of his attack using a camera mounted on a helmet. He broadcast his remarks live to an online chat platform. In the 35-minute video, which Mr. Balliet said was inspired by the New Zealand massacres that were also livestreamed by the perpetrator, he declared, “The root of all these problems is the Jew.” Kai Lohse, a federal prosecutor, confirmed that Mr. Balliet blamed Jews for the problems he identified in German society. “He described Jews as rats that had to be lured out of the synagogue” to be killed, Mr. Lohse told the court. Prosecutors have found no indication the attacker was part of a larger network beyond the virtual world where he drew inspiration. Mr. Balliet largely confessed, in the courtroom and earlier to prosecutors, to the charges against him, including the two counts of murder. His only remorse, he said, was that both people he killed were white. The death of the woman, identified only as Jana L., in keeping with German privacy laws, was “not planned or wanted,” he said, but when she made a remark that upset him, he had no choice but to shoot her. “If I hadn’t done that, everyone would have laughed at me,” he said, explaining that because he was livestreaming the attack, those watching would have realized that “a stupid comment is enough to stop someone from the Right.” His intent, though, had been to empty his weapons inside the synagogue, he said. When he was thwarted by its heavy oak doors, he headed for a kebab shop and opened fire. “Someone was standing in the door and I shot him,” he told the court, adding that he had thought the man he killed, identified only as Kevin S., was “Middle Eastern.” Dozens of the 52 people who had gathered for services in Halle’s Humboldt Street Synagogue last year on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, were among those who packed the courtroom on Tuesday. In a statement released by their lawyer before the trial began, they expressed hope that the proceedings would draw attention to the role the internet plays in fueling far-right hatred and the links between anti-Semitism and other forms of hatred. “The perpetrator chose his targets on the basis of a white, racist ideology that fuses anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, sexism and xenophobia with conspiracy theories,” they said. “His radicalization took place in online communities that strengthened and promoted these beliefs.” In June last year, a conservative politician who supported refugees, Walter Lübcke, was fatally shot just outside his home in western Germany, in the country’s first far-right political assassination since the Nazi era. Security forces then revealed that Mr. Lübcke was one of many people on a neo-Nazi hit list. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has since declared far-right extremism the “biggest security threat facing Germany,” and promised a beefed-up security response. However, minority rights activists and opposition leaders accuse the authorities of being too quick to write off individuals like Mr. Balliet as lone actors with no connection to the societies in which they live. “He did not simply radicalize out of nowhere,” Cem Ozdimir, a lawmaker for the opposition Greens, told n-tv television on Tuesday, adding that most extremists are men who are marked by misogyny, as well as hatred of Jews and Muslims. “It is important that the whole of society stands up,” he said, “and says we want to chase this hate back into hell, where it came from.”']",A 28-year-old racist is charged with murdering two people in an assault that raised alarm about the spread of right-wing extremism online.
Crowd Catches 2 French Children Who Leapt From Burning Apartment,2020-07-23,By Elian Peltier,"['As a plume of thick black smoke billowed from their burning apartment, a 10-year-old boy dangled a younger child from an open third-floor window, grasping on to the back of his shirt. The apartment’s balcony was engulfed in flames, and the two children appeared trapped. Then, as onlookers screamed, the older boy dropped the younger one, age 3, into the arms of a group of adults 30 feet below. They caught him. Moments later, the older boy lowered himself out of the window and jumped into the outstretched arms of those standing below. Both children were unharmed. The dramatic rescue that unfolded on Tuesday in the French city of Grenoble was caught on video and drew widespread admiration for the quick thinking of the children and the actions of the good Samaritans who broke their fall. Two of the six adults who appeared to have participated in the rescue broke their arms, according to French news reports. All have been hailed as heroes. “It is together that they could save the children,” Éric Piolle, the mayor of Grenoble, said in a statement, as he praised the “heroic rescue.” At least 17 people were injured in the fire in Grenoble, a city of 160,000, according to news reports, and the cause is still being investigated. The two children were hospitalized for smoke inhalation according to French media. As for the rescuers, they were humble about their roles. “The children gave us the courage, because they decided to jump,” Athoumani Walid, one of the men whose arm was broken, told France 24. It is not the first time that a dramatic rescue of a child dangling from an apartment has been caught on camera in France. In May 2018, Mamoudou Gassama, a 22-year-old Malian man, scaled four floors of a Paris building to save a toddler hanging from a balcony. Hailed as the “Spider-Man of the 18th,” for the arrondissement where the rescue unfolded, Mr. Gassama joined the city’s fire brigade after he was granted legal residency in the country.']","The boys, aged 3 and 10, landed safely after people gathered below to break their fall."
A Girl’s Heroic Battle Against the Taliban Was Also a Family Feud,2020-07-22,"By Asadullah Timory, Najim Rahim and Mujib Mashal","['The teenage girl was the hero of a night of carnage that left her family’s hillside home in western Afghanistan strewn with bodies. Qamar Gul, 15, fought to her last bullet, gunning down Taliban attackers who raided the house and killed her father and mother. In the days after the attack last week, Afghan social media was full of slick posters celebrating her as “My Hero.” Some users compared her to the Kurdish women of Kobani, Syria, who fought the Islamic State. Local officials put out pictures of Qamar Gul posing with her rifle. Afghanistan’s vice president praised her for defending against “the enemies of the nation."" But the story of her heroism is steeped in pain, in a culture that often treats women as property, and in the confusion of an Afghan war that has twisted families into knots of complex loyalties and feuds. One of the attackers she killed was her own husband, who was fighting on the Taliban’s side and apparently seeking her forcible return after a falling out with Ms. Gul’s family, according to relatives and local officials. As the war in Afghanistan drags on, the violence has increasingly become local. Beyond the headlines of the major clashes between government forces and Taliban militants often lies a more complicated reality of local power rivalries, of a tug of war between mafia groups and drug-dealing rings, and of communities and families torn apart. Increasingly, both the pro-government and Taliban side are drawing on the same pools of local fighters. In villages and rural districts, the Taliban are not an unknown force — they are mostly the sons and brothers and husbands everyone there knows. And the Afghan government has in large stretches of the country found itself relying on tens of thousands of local militiamen, called the Public Uprising, to try to hold territory. They often bear the brunt of the fighting, but their casualties rarely make it to official records of the toll of the war on Afghan forces. Ghor Province, where the incident happened, has remained restive in recent years and proved particularly brutal for women. In government-controlled areas, girls have been bartered for dowries at a young age. Graphic videos of stoning and flogging have repeatedly come out of the Taliban-controlled areas. The village in Taiwara district where Qamar Gul’s home was raided lies on the edge, near where government control gives way to the Taliban. But the family’s fate had intertwined with violence long before the recent battle. Qamar Gul’s mother, Fatima, had married twice before ending up with her father, Shah Gul Rahimi, according to Zabihullah Rahmani, a relative. Fatima’s first husband died young of an overdose while working as a laborer in Iran, leaving behind a son who is now a police officer. Her second marriage to a local commander was short-lived: He was killed in clashes with the Taliban in the 1990s. Shah Gul, the local commander’s younger brother, stepped in to marry Fatima. They had two children together, Qamar Gul, and her 12-year-old brother Habibullah. In recent years, Mr. Rahimi, who was just 40, took on his brother’s responsibilities as a community elder in Taiwara. He frequently helped with the Local Uprising militia fending off Taliban attacks, joining them in their battles. But it wasn’t clear whether he was also on a government payroll — the militias are paid anywhere between $50 to $150 by the Afghan intelligence agency and provided ammunition — or whether he was just helping in his role as a local elder. Residents described him as a stalwart fighter, despite having had one hand amputated years before. About four years ago, Mr. Rahimi struck an agreement with a local man from an adjacent village named Mohamed Naeem: Mr. Naeem would marry Mr. Rahimi’s daughter, Qamar, as his second wife. In exchange, Mr. Rahimi would take Mr. Naeem’s teenage niece as his second wife. Since both girls were young, they waited two years before making the marriage official in separate wedding ceremonies. Mr. Naeem and Mr. Rahimi had grown so close that when Mr. Naeem needed a loan of about $3,000, Mr. Rahimi became his guarantor at a business that gave him the loan. “Naeem was his son-in-law, and they got along very well too,” said Sebghatullah, Mr. Rahimi’s nephew. “It all turned upside down at once.”  Just how Mr. Naeem joined the Taliban is not exactly clear. But relatives and local officials said it happened over the course of the past two years, as his private life started falling apart and he was chased for his debts. Mr. Naeem, who had taken his new bride to his old home, right away got into arguments with his parents over how unfairly he treated his first wife by spending all his time with the younger Qamar Gul, said the relative, Mr. Rahmani. After one fight, Mr. Naeem took Qamar Gul and left, first staying with his in-laws and then moving his home to neighboring Helmand Province, a Taliban stronghold. “He swore that he would never return to his own village,” said Abdullah, Qamar Gul’s maternal uncle. “Naeem lived with his father-in-law for a while, he was given a room at the house. But the people he owed money to now kept knocking on his father-in-law’s door.” The trouble seems to have begun when Mr. Rahimi’s new wife visited her family and refused to return to her husband, saying she didn’t want to live with him, according to the two relatives. In return, when Qamar Gul came home, her father held her until the family returned his wife and Mr. Naeem paid the $3,000 debt for which Mr. Rahimi was being harassed. After several rounds of mediation with local elders, Mr. Rahimi agreed a compromise: He would let Qamar Gul return only if Mr. Naeem paid the debt. “Naeem’s niece wasn’t happy with the marriage because Shah Gul was much older than her. But Qamar Gul wasn’t arguing much — she said she was OK with whatever her father had decided, but that Naeem had to pay back the debt,” Mr. Rahmani said. But Mr. Naeem had other thoughts: He had grown close to a ruthless Taliban commander in Ghor who would help him take Qamar Gul home without paying any money. They chose the early hours after midnight on July 17 for a surprise attack, with about a dozen of their fighters surrounding the hillside home and barging in. When Mr. Rahimi had come out of the hallway to see what was happening, he was given no chance to run for his weapon. He had six bullet wounds, including one in the neck. When Qamar Gul’s mother, Fatima, came out to cry for help after her husband was shot, she was also shot, three times — twice in her chest, once also in the neck, family members said. Qamar Gul grabbed her father’s weapon, ran to the doorway, and began spraying at the attackers in the yard. She shot two of them dead,  and wounded the senior Taliban commander. The Taliban fled the scene as neighbors and local militia fighters began arriving. Two days after the attack, the Ghor provincial governor put out a statement saying Qamar Gul and her 12-year old brother had defeated an “offensive attack” by the “Taliban terrorist group” and forced the “bloodthirsty Taliban to flee, leaving behind two of their dead in the battlefield.” The statement attached graphic photos of two bodies. One was Mr. Naeem, Qamar Gul’s husband, the chest of his embroidered tunic soaked in blood.']","A teenage Afghan girl was celebrated for killing Taliban who attacked her home.

E.U. Adopts Groundbreaking Stimulus to Fight Coronavirus Recession,2020-07-21,By Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"['BRUSSELS — After nearly five days of intense haggling, European Union leaders early on Tuesday stepped up to confront one of the gravest challenges in the bloc’s history, agreeing to a landmark spending package to rescue their economies from the ravages of the pandemic. The 750 billion euro ($857 billion) stimulus agreement, spearheaded by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France, sent a strong signal of solidarity even as it exposed deep new fault lines in a bloc reshaped by Britain’s exit. The deal was notable for its firsts: European countries will raise large sums by selling bonds collectively, rather than individually; and much of that money will be handed out to member nations hit hardest by the pandemic as grants that do not have to be repaid, and not as loans that would swell their national debts. Those extraordinary steps reflected a difficult consensus among members: that the scale of the crisis facing them required groundbreaking measures to ensure the bloc’s legitimacy, stability and prosperity. “Europe has shown it is able to break new ground in a special situation. Exceptional situations require exceptional measures,” Ms. Merkel said in a news conference at dawn. “A very special construct of 27 countries of different backgrounds is actually able to act together, and it has proven it.” But the lengthy negotiations in Brussels were notable, too, for their exceptional rancor — and it was clear that the pooling of resources and sovereignty had come at a cost. A strange kind of political theater, never visited upon European Union summits before, marked the meeting — with leaders donning masks and bumping elbows to greet. They were safely spaced in a vast hall, their entourages trimmed to only the most essential members. When they convened on Friday, it was their first in-person summit in the five months since the coronavirus took hold in Europe. The meeting was officially scheduled to last until Saturday. By Monday morning, exhausted and angry after bargaining all night, they were still tussling over the details. The start of Monday’s session was twice delayed, and then it spilled into Tuesday morning. As negotiations broke down over the weekend, so did many precautions the leaders and their teams had taken to protect themselves from the virus, which in most of Europe has been brought down to manageable levels, in any case. As the hours wore on and the talks grew heated, the diplomatic gloves came off, and so did the masks. Breakout groups met in rooms far smaller and less ventilated than the 300-seat auditorium where the general meeting was convened. While there is no underestimating the importance of the agreement — the generosity of its size and the novelty of its mechanisms — the acrimony and dramatics of the four-day meeting betrayed the new divisions within the bloc. They also signaled where the fractures may lie in future crises. The talks were defined by shifting roles among members now jostling to make their voices heard and for leadership in the absence of Britain, which had often played the part of the thrifty contrarian, fastidious about rules, in past summits. This time, Ms. Merkel, unusually for a German leader, and holding the E.U.’s rotating presidency, put her finger on the scale on behalf of hard-hit southern countries and did battle with the nations she once championed, the northern members that have been less affected by the virus and are wary of the vast sums being thrown around. Where Friday’s meeting was marked by joyful greetings and even celebrations of the birthdays of two leaders — Ms. Merkel, now 66, and Prime Minister Antonio Costa of Portugal, who turned 59 — Sunday night’s dinner (a “cold dish” after several sumptuous meals, socially spaced but unmasked) was marked by shouting matches and a nasty atmosphere. Mr. Macron, for example, yelled at Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria for not only being a tightfisted impediment to the rescue deal but also for leaving the room to take a call. To some leaders’ shock, the French president slapped the table. Mr. Kurz tried to keep his cool, and in a zinger put Mr. Macron’s temper tantrum down to sleep deprivation, diplomats said. As that meeting broke up without a deal around 6 a.m. Monday, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told his country’s media that he didn’t care if other leaders mockingly called him “Mr. No” for blocking the agreement. (They did.) “We’re here because everyone is taking care of their own country, not to go to each other’s birthdays for the rest of our lives,” he said bluntly. It was Mr. Rutte who stepped into the vacuum left by Germany’s shift and Britain’s departure to lead the so-called Frugal Four, which includes his nation as well as Austria, Sweden and Denmark. Occasionally, the “frugals” became five with the support of Finland. In the end, with a unanimous decision by the 27 nations needed for a plan to go forward, a bitter compromise prevailed. The ambitious plan pushed by Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron was watered down, but remained significant. The overall figure of €750 billion remained, but an original proposal to offer €500 billion of that in the form of grants was trimmed back to €390 billion, with €360 billion earmarked for loans. In addition to raising cash and extending grants, the package will increase lending and deploy other, more traditional stimulus methods to arrest and reverse the economic free-fall that threatens the stability of the world’s richest bloc of nations. Economists predict a recession far worse than anything since World War II. France, Italy and Spain, the bloc’s second-, third- and fourth-largest economies, are expected to suffer the most, clocking in contractions of around 10 percent this year. Greece and other smaller economies that are still recovering from the last recession will also be badly affected by the downturn. But heavy debt loads in many of these nations make them reluctant to amass yet more debt, and their budgets aren’t sufficient to self-fund their recoveries. That led them to turn to the European Union for help. Together with the vast bond-buying program by the European Central Bank, national stimulus plans worth trillions of euros, and other, smaller E.U. support schemes for banks, businesses and workers, European leaders hope to reverse the recession in 2021 and spend their way into a rapid and powerful recovery. They also agreed on Tuesday on the bloc’s regular budget for the next seven years: €1.1 trillion euros to finance the normal E.U. policies on agriculture, migration and hundreds of other programs. But the deal came at a heavy price in progressive goals attached to E.U. values and norms. To bring Hungary and Poland on board, E.U. leaders decided to water down the caveat making funding conditional on the rule-of- law benchmarks that the two nations’ illiberal governments are violating. In another concession to Poland, the bloc’s most coal-dependent nation, a requirement was dropped that would have committed the country to being carbon neutral by 2050 to draw on parts of the funds. Since its inception, the E.U. has struggled between maintaining nation-state sovereignty and developing joint federal-style structures. The deal reached on Tuesday is significant in that more creditworthy E.U. nations will be underwriting loans to fund the recoveries of countries that would otherwise face onerous borrowing costs. The Netherlands and Austria were hostile to the very idea of borrowing money and simply giving much of it to benefit mostly southern, weaker economies. Under significant pressure at home as elections approach next March, the Dutch prime minister, Mr. Rutte, advocated loudly for fewer handouts to those nations, among them Italy and Spain, that have been hardest hit by the pandemic but that also have structurally weak, unreformed economies. The Netherlands and other wealthier nations with healthier public finances are concerned that the commonly funded aid would simply go into a bottomless pit of spending that doesn’t truly help these economies recover without changes to make it easier to reduce bureaucracy, create jobs and stimulate growth. A key argument in favor of offering grants rather than loans has been that Italy and other countries likely to take the aid are already over-indebted, and piling on yet more loans would just worsen their positions. Mr. Rutte fought successfully for bigger-than-usual rebates, or reimbursements, for his own and other nations that are net contributors to the E.U. budget. He and the others succeeded in wringing out another concession: Any country that wishes to use the new funds will need to submit a plan for how it intends to spend the money. The other E.U. nations will have a chance to review and object to the plan within three days of its submission and demand that it be tweaked. Still, that mechanism fell short of the outright veto that Mr. Rutte had demanded, which the Italian and Spanish leaders denounced as an unacceptable encroachment into their authority. The package will go to the European Parliament for ratification, and is expected to face a serious challenge on the grounds that it does not tackle concerns about how Poland and Hungary’s governments violate the bloc’s standards for democracy and the rule of law.

"Defying U.N. Ban, Chinese Ships Pay North Korea to Fish in Its Waters",2020-07-22,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — When the United Nations imposed its toughest sanctions yet on North Korea in 2017, one of the main targets was squid. It was one of the country’s top exports, and the Security Council hoped to bring the trade to a halt, as part of the international effort to pressure the North into giving up nuclear weapons. But squid fishing in North Korean waters has continued on a large scale, a nonprofit group that tracks commercial fishing said Thursday. And the boats bringing in most of the catch are not North Korean, but Chinese — “dark fleets” that defy sanctions enforcement by concealing their locations and identities. Since the sanctions took effect, Chinese vessels have caught more than half a billion dollars’ worth of squid, says the group, Global Fishing Watch, which advocates for sustainable fishing. That money does not go to North Korea, but the boats pay the North for fishing rights — an arrangement that has been in place for more than 15 years, and which still brings in hard currency for the pariah state, despite the ban. What is more, the Chinese boats — bigger and better-equipped — have been squeezing North Korean fishermen out of their own waters. That forces them on dangerous voyages to more-distant seas, many of which end in death. “It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation’s waters,” said Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and a lead author of two reports on the subject that the group published Thursday. A United Nations panel has previously said that Chinese boats were still fishing in the North’s waters, despite the 2017 sanctions — which, besides banning the export of North Korean seafood, coal, iron ore and other resources, specifically prohibit the purchase of fishing rights from the Pyongyang government. But the Global Fishing Watch reports add considerably to what is known about the Chinese activity, including its connection to the deaths of North Korean fishermen in far-off waters. Over the past several years, hundreds of small North Korean boats, some so primitive that they used stones for anchors, have washed up on the coasts of Japan and Russia — most empty, but some with hungry survivors aboard, and others containing human remains. Forty-five such “ghost ships” were found in Japan in 2015, and their numbers have risen dramatically since then. In 2018, 225 North Korean boats were found on Japanese shores. Last year, there were 158. The crews of the boats that turn up empty are believed to have either drowned or been rescued by other North Korean fishermen. “These incidents often involve starvation and deaths, and many fishing villages on North Korea’s eastern coast have now been coined ‘widows’ villages,’” Global Fishing Watch said in one of its new reports, “Illuminating Dark Fishing Fleets in North Korea,” which was published in the journal Science Advances. Using satellite technology, and working with researchers from South Korea, Japan, the United States and Australia, Global Fishing Watch determined that more than 900 vessels of Chinese origin had fished in North Korean waters during the 2017 squid season. It counted 700 for 2018. The ships “do not publicly broadcast their locations or appear in public monitoring systems,” the group said. The Chinese ships were estimated to have caught nearly as much squid in those years as Japan and South Korea combined: more than 160,000 metric tons, worth more than $440 million, the report said. Fewer squid are now being caught in South Korean and Japanese waters because so many are caught near North Korea before the creatures can migrate south, according to Global Fishing Watch and the South Korean government. Last year, 800 Chinese vessels in North Korean waters brought in $240 million worth of squid, Global Fishing Watch said. About $560 million worth has been caught by Chinese boats since the United Nations sanctions took effect in September 2017, the group estimated. “The scale of the fleet involved in this illegal fishing is about one-third the size of China’s entire distant-water fishing fleet,” said Mr. Park, the Global Fishing Watch scientist. The group did not estimate how much North Korea had been earning from the sale of fishing rights. But the heavy Chinese presence indicates that it remains an important source of illicit income for the North, as the country struggles under the stranglehold of sanctions and the fallout from Covid-19. A 2016 study by the Korea Maritime Institute, a think tank in South Korea, concluded that Chinese vessels each spent $30,000 to $80,000 for an annual permit to fish in North Korean waters. If the numbers reported by Global Fishing Watch are correct, that would mean tens of millions of dollars per year for the North, if not more. A more recent estimate came in March, when the United Nations panel studying sanctions compliance said an unidentified member state had reported that North Korea made $120 million in 2018 by selling fishing rights. The North’s fishing industry has been hobbled for decades by its decrepit fleet and the scarcity of fuel. The country began opening the rich fishing grounds off its east coast to Chinese ships in 2004, choosing to earn foreign currency by selling the rights instead of catching and exporting the squid itself, according to the Korea Maritime Institute report. For years, squid has been the main catch in the North Korean waters opened to the Chinese, where other fish are less abundant than they once were. The Chinese ships are only given the right to fish for squid, but South Korean officials have said that they bring in other seafood, too. Even as Chinese boats trawl the North’s waters, its leader, Kim Jong-un, has been urging his people to catch more fish. State media have often reported Mr. Kim’s visits to fishing towns, where he has been said to marvel at bales of frozen fish stacked like “gold bars” and to claim that “the socialist fragrance of the sea” made his fatigue go away. “He used to feel like making time to sail out to the sea and fish with the fishermen,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency said in late 2018. But North Korean fishermen have been unable to compete with the Chinese boats, which are bigger and use more-powerful electric lights to attract squid at night, Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported last October, citing an unidentified source on the North’s east coast. Despite the dangers, many fishermen bribe government officials for permission to make long-distance trips, according to Daily NK. Japan has complained about thousands of North Koreans fishing illegally in its waters, and its Coast Guard has tried to repel them with water cannons. Squid is popular in South Korea and Japan as well as in China, where North Korean smugglers still bring it in across the border, according to defectors from the North. The United Nations panel reported cases in which Chinese fishing vessels changed their names, or carried North Korean fishing licenses or flags, to conceal the fact that they were violating the sanctions. China told the panel that while it was committed to enforcing the sanctions, its ability to do so was hampered by such ships’ use of counterfeit identities. Global Fishing Watch said that although the vessels it identified originated in China and were assumed to be owned and operated by Chinese people, they were likely to be “three no” ships, operating with no legitimate registration, flag or license. At any rate, their fishing in North Korean waters is “a clear contravention of the core intention” of the 2017 sanctions, Mr. Park said.']","Chinese vessels have caught $560 million worth of squid off the North’s shores since the United Nations banned the practice in 2017, says a group that tracks commercial fishing."
"With Officials’ Backing, Dubious Virus Remedies Surge in Latin America",2020-07-23,"By María Silvia Trigo, Anatoly Kurmanaev and José María León Cabrera","['TARIJA, Bolivia — In Cochabamba, high in the Bolivian Andes, people line up daily outside pharmacies on the central plaza, eager to buy the scarce elixir they hope will ward off Covid-19: chlorine dioxide, a kind of bleach used to disinfect swimming pools and floors. Experts say drinking it is pointless at best and hazardous at worst. But in Bolivia, where people have been hospitalized after ingesting chlorine dioxide, regional authorities are testing it on prison inmates, the national Senate last week approved its use and a top lawmaker has threatened to expel the World Health Organization for opposing its medical use. Julio César Baldivieso, a local soccer hero and former national team captain, told a local television station that because Cochabamba’s hospitals “don’t have tests, they don’t have materials, they don’t have protective equipment,” he and his family had turned to chlorine dioxide to treat their coronavirus symptoms. Bolivians have a lot of company in resorting to unproven and even dangerous treatments to prevent or treat infection. In every part of the world, hard science has had to compete for attention with pet theories, rumors and traditional beliefs during this pandemic, as in the past. But interest in dubious medicines has been especially high recently in Latin America, where the virus is raging uncontrolled and many political leaders on the right and left are promoting them, whether out of genuine faith or a desire to offer hope and deflect blame. In a region where few people can afford quality medical care, alternative treatments are widely touted on social media and exploited by profiteers. “The people feel desperate when confronted with Covid-19,” said Santiago Ron, an Ecuadorean biology professor, who has clashed with proponents of supposed treatments, including lawmakers. “They are very vulnerable to pseudoscientific promises.” Coronavirus has infected more than three million people and killed about 160,000 in Latin America, according to official figures, making the region one of the worst-hit by the pandemic. And experts and statistical analyses indicate that the real toll is far higher, concealed by limited testing and medical resources, and by some governments’ resistance to publicly acknowledging the scope of the crisis. Covid-19 has battered already-fragile health care systems, and lockdown measures have devastated economies without bringing the virus under control. Scientists are testing a wide range of unproven treatments, but the odds of any one of them being helpful are considered low, and some of them are known to be potentially harmful. In many cases, there is no solid evidence yet as to whether they work against the coronavirus. One such drug generating intense interest is ivermectin, which is used to treat intestinal worms. Two Brazilian cabinet ministers announced on Monday that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, and one of them said that he was treating it with ivermectin, among other drugs. The government of Peru bought ivermectin to fight the pandemic, and has continued to promote it, even after the W.H.O. said it should not be used for coronavirus. That has fueled the explosion of an illegal market for the veterinary version of ivermectin, forcing the Peruvian government — and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — to warn citizens against using drugs intended for farm animals. Even so, in the small town of Nauta, in the Peruvian Amazon, the local government and religious groups went so far as to give veterinary ivermectin to adults and children as young as 4, according to local media and a human rights group. The United States also has witnessed its top government official promoting unfounded treatments. President Trump has mused about treating the virus with powerful lights or disinfectant injections. He has repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, calling it a “game changer” in the pandemic, despite scientific research to the contrary, and has said he took it for two weeks. But in the United States, hydroxychloroquine does not have nearly the official imprimatur that it does in parts of Latin America. In Brazil, with the world’s second-highest coronavirus caseload and death toll after the United States, President Jair Bolsonaro has relentlessly promoted the drug — even after he, himself, developed Covid-19, despite taking the drug for months. He has ordered the military to mass-produce it, and after his diagnosis he waved a package of it before cheering supporters. Governments in El Salvador, Peru and Paraguay have bought hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus. Studies have found that the drug did not lessen the chance of infection, reduce the severity of Covid-19 or speed recovery. But it is potentially dangerous, particularly for people with abnormal heart rhythms. In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro’s government, which is struggling to provide even running water and soap to crumbling hospitals, has boasted of obtaining from its ally Cuba tens of thousands of doses of a drug, interferon alfa-2b, used against viruses and cancers, to fight the pandemic. Government clinics now require patients with coronavirus symptoms to take the drug. But there has been no definitive evidence yet that this particular drug, one of many in the interferon class, works against the coronavirus, and in the United States, the National Institutes of Health does not currently recommend its use in patients with Covid-19. Following Bolivia’s example, Ecuador’s Congress recently discussed whether to allow chlorine dioxide as a coronavirus treatment, and 10 local Roman Catholic bishops have called for its use. The chemical has long been marketed without official approval, including in the United States, as a cure for ailments from AIDS to autism. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly said it has no medical value and can have potentially lethal effects, including “severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration and acute liver failure.” At least 10 Bolivians have been hospitalized with chlorine dioxide poisoning in recent weeks, according to the Health Ministry. But on Wednesday, Efraín Chambi, the majority leader of the national Senate, said his party would ask the W.H.O. to leave the country if it continues to warn people not to take chlorine dioxide. “They are not doing any favors to the Bolivian people,” he said. “We believe they are on the side of large multinational” companies. After successfully containing the disease for months, Bolivia, one of Latin America’s poorest countries, succumbed to an aggressive outbreak this month that has overwhelmed hospitals. This week, the police collected hundreds of bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims from streets and homes in the cities of Santa Cruz and La Paz, and on Thursday, the government postponed national elections from September to October, citing health concerns. The virus swiftly swept through the highest echelons of power, infecting the interim president, Jeanine Añez, and half of her cabinet, fueling a sense of helplessness. Politicians and popular public figures began promoting chlorine dioxide as an alternative treatment. The opposition-controlled Senate last week passed a bill that would allow local governments to supply the solution free for medical use, despite protests from the Health Ministry. Ms. Añez has remained silent on the controversy, as her election bid loses support. In Cochabamba, in the center of the country, where a pint bottle of chlorine dioxide solution sells for $8 — when it can be found — residents blocked the road to the municipal waste treatment plant until local authorities promised to provide it free. Mr. Baldivieso, 48, the soccer coach, said he and his entire family began drinking the chemical after first experiencing coronavirus symptoms. He said he had to wait 15 days for a test result, which came back positive. “What if we just did nothing all that time?” he said. In the Bolivian capital, Sucre, local health officials last week began testing chlorine dioxide on 200 local prison inmates and guards, some with coronavirus symptoms. The prison chief, Ludwin Miranda, said that all the participants had signed consent forms. In San José de Chiquitos, an eastern Bolivian town of 30,000, the mayor distributed chlorine dioxide to local medical centers to treat the virus. “The application of chlorine dioxide has produced perfect results in the recuperation of critical patients,” the mayor, Germaín Caballero, told a local television station last week. “We have managed to control the pandemic.” Medical experts say chlorine dioxide is, at best, a placebo — and, as with any placebo, people might credit it for their recoveries. Those who advocate chlorine dioxide “create a false sense of security,” Virgilio Prieto, director of epidemiology at Bolivia’s Health Ministry, said in an interview. “By promoting its indiscriminate and irresponsible use, they are putting the population at risk.” María Silvia Trigo reported from Tarija, Bolivia; Anatoly Kurmanaev from Caracas, Venezuela, and José María León Cabrera from Quito, Ecuador.

Iranian Civilian Jet Swerves to Avoid American Warplane in Syria,2020-07-23,"By Vivian Yee, Farnaz Fassihi and Eric Schmitt","['BEIRUT, Lebanon — An Iranian passenger plane en route from Iran to Beirut swerved and dropped abruptly on Thursday to avoid a nearby American fighter jet, injuring several passengers before landing in Beirut. Videos broadcast by Iranian and pro-Iran Lebanese media, which said the footage was taken by passengers, showed a fighter jet flying alongside the passenger plane, operated by Mahan Air, a privately owned Iranian airline. Passengers then screamed as sudden turbulence seized the plane. In the aftermath, one video showed a passenger with his face and head bloodied, as well as a man lying down, apparently unconscious, while someone tended to him. Oxygen masks dangled overhead. Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said in a statement later Thursday that an Air Force F-15 on “a routine air mission” near a small American military base in southern Syria had conducted “a standard visual inspection of a Mahan Air passenger airliner.” American fighter jets fly daily patrols near the base, Al-Tanf, where 150 to 200 U.S. troops train Syrian fighters, known as Maghawir al Thawra, who are fighting the Islamic State. Captain Urban said the encounter on Thursday was conducted at “a safe distance of approximately 1,000 meters” and was done to “ensure the safety of coalition personnel.” “Once the F-15 pilot identified the aircraft as a Mahan Air passenger plane,” Captain Urban added, “the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft.” He said the encounter was done “in accordance with international standards.” A U.S. military official said a second U.S. Air Force F-15 was at least two miles away from the Mahan Air jetliner, but only one of the U.S. aircraft closed to about 1,000 meters. Iranian state television, citing an interview with the Mahan Air pilot, had reported earlier that the fighter jets were American. Lebanese media said an elderly passenger had been taken to a hospital affiliated with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia and political party. Lebanese civil aviation authorities said the plane had been carrying 150 passengers, some of whom suffered minor injuries. The American base at Al-Tanf, which sits near southern Syria’s border with Jordan and Iraq, is strategically located to block Iran from controlling a land route through Iraq to Syria and Lebanon. In recent months, the American-backed Syrian forces have skirmished with roving bands of suspected Islamic State fighters near Al-Tanf. In May 2017, American warplanes attacked a pro-Syrian government convoy that ignored warnings and violated a restricted zone around the base. The American-led international coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria flies combat air patrols over northeastern Syria to support about 500 American troops who carry out missions with Syrian Kurdish allies on the ground to counter pockets of ISIS fighters. The Mahan Air encounter came as Iran was already on edge after a series of mysterious explosions and violent attacks against its civilian and military infrastructure, including at a nuclear fuel enrichment complex in early July. Iranian officials have attributed some of the recent attacks to sabotage, though they have not said whether they suspect the United States. The encounter could amplify tensions between Iran and the United States, which is pursuing a hard-line campaign of sanctions and other actions against Iran that the Trump administration calls a “maximum pressure” strategy. Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, said Iran had contacted the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which protects American interests in Iran, to warn that the United States would be held accountable if anything happened to the Mahan Air flight, which later left Beirut empty to return to Iran. Mr. Mousavi said Iran’s mission to the United Nations had also conveyed this message to the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres. “We are investigating the details of this incident and after information is complete we will take necessary legal and political measures,” Mr. Mousavi said. A number of analysts said the Mahan Air episode appeared to fit a pattern of recent efforts to unnerve and destabilize Iran. “The timing of this incident is revealing,” said Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver. “It takes place against the backdrop of recent bombings in Iran that are widely attributed to Israel with the blessing of the U.S.A.” It remained far from clear, however, whether the warplane action was deliberate. Hesameddin Ashena, a senior adviser to President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on Twitter, “Those who love the lives of their leaders don’t play with the lives of our passengers.” While Iran and the United States have many longstanding grievances, for Iran one of the most potent remains the 1988 shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane by the Vincennes, an American warship that had been patrolling in the Persian Gulf. The plane, Iran Air Flight 655, carried 290 people. The United States later called it “a tragic and regrettable accident,” and subsequently paid millions to settle a lawsuit that Iran filed at the International Court of Justice.

Officer Details Killing of Police Partner in Trial of Americans in Rome,2020-07-21,By Elisabetta Povoledo,"['ROME — The long-awaited appearance in court of Andrea Varriale, a crucial witness in a murder case against two young American men accused of killing an Italian law enforcement officer last year, played out in a Rome courtroom this month. Three tension-filled days of sworn testimony shed some light on how a night of routine police work ended in tragedy, in a case that hinges on one fact: whether the two defendants were aware that the witness and his partner were plainclothes officers when they approached the Americans on an empty street corner before dawn. Officer Varriale and his partner that night, Deputy Brig. Mario Cerciello Rega, engaged in a brief scuffle with the two Americans, who had been vacationing in Rome, while on a patrol shift in the early hours of July 26, 2019. Brigadier Cerciello Rega was repeatedly stabbed with a knife, and the two Americans — Finnegan Elder, now 20, and Gabriel Natale Hjorth, now 19 — are on trial, accused of his murder. They had been vacationing in Rome, and they have admitted to killing the officer. The case has attracted significant media attention in Italy and the United States, in part because of the youth of those involved. Brigadier Cerciello Rega, 35, was a member of the Carabinieri, Italy’s national military police force, and newly married. His death stunned Italians at a time when the country was being run by a center-right coalition that stoked fears — without evidence — that the nation was being racked by violent crimes mostly committed by foreigners. Proceedings reopened to the news media this month after a one-month halt and three months of closed-door hearings because of coronavirus restrictions. Rome’s courthouse remains closed to the public. The encounter between the American teenagers and the officers had been set up to swap a backpack the teenagers had stolen earlier. Prosecutors say the teenagers attacked the officers to avoid arrest, while the defense argues that the Americans acted in self-defense, believing the plainclothes officers to be ill-intentioned thugs. On the stand, Officer Varriale testified that he and his partner had clearly identified themselves as Carabinieri as they approached the teenagers. He said he pulled out his wallet, flipped it open to show his badge, then tucked it into the rear pocket of his jeans so he could move closer, empty-handed. A fight immediately ensued, and he began rolling around on the ground with Mr. Natale Hjorth, “clumsily,” he said. Then, he said, “I heard Mario scream, ‘Stop, stop, Carabinieri,’ with a voice that wasn’t his own,” so he let the teenager go and attended to his partner. Prosecutors played the anguished telephone call Officer Varriale made for an ambulance as Brigadier Cerciello Rega lay dying. His widow, Rosa Maria Ersilia, wept, clutching a laminated photo of her dead husband in uniform. The emotion was too much for Ms. Ersilia’s father, Mario, who collapsed and had to be taken to a hospital last week, abruptly ending that day’s proceedings. The death of Brigadier Cerciello Rega was the last act of a convoluted drama that began in a trendy Rome neighborhood full of nightclubs where the two Americans had gone to buy drugs earlier in the evening. The teenagers were sold an aspirin substitute instead of cocaine, and they grabbed the backpack of Sergio Brugiatelli, the Roman who had acted as a middleman in the deal, demanding money and cocaine for its return. The officer died during an operation to recover the backpack. Over two full days on the stand, defense lawyers pointed to inconsistencies in Officer Varriale’s earlier depositions and critiqued actions they said were inappropriate. Mr. Natale Hjorth was at one point blindfolded and handcuffed while he was detained, raising accusations of unlawful treatment. Officer Varriale made a video of Mr. Natale Hjorth in that moment, asking the defendant several questions, but he said in court that he had not wanted to interrogate him. He admitted that treating a detained person in such a way “seemed strange,” but he said many of his superiors were in the room, so he didn’t think there was cause to intervene. The jury also heard that when he was first interrogated in the days after the crime, Officer Varriale told his superiors that he and the brigadier had brought their guns with them that night, a detail that was later found to be false. He is currently on trial in a military court for not carrying his service weapon. On the stand, he said that he had made a mistake in lying to his superiors, calling the decision “thoughtless” and “foolish.” “It was my decision that night” to go out without a gun, one he had not repeated since, he said Monday. But Officer Varriale said his memory failed him when the defense questioned him on other details, including calls placed to and from his cellphone on the night of the crime. Those calls went to two off-duty Carabinieri officers who had been tailing Mr. Elder, Mr. Natale Hjorth and Mr. Brugiatelli for an hour, believing a drug deal was about to go down. As interpreters whispered translations, both defendants sat silently throughout the procedures while their lawyers butted heads with prosecutors and Mr. Varriale’s lawyer. Tempers occasionally flared. Ms. Ersilia, the brigadier’s widow, sat quietly a few rows behind them with other family members. Commemorations were planned this week in Rome and Somma Vesuviana, Brigadier Cerciello Rega’s hometown, to mark the anniversary of his death. On July 13, a two-story poster appeared on a palazzo next to the street corner where he was stabbed to commemorate what would have been his 36th birthday and the 206th anniversary of the foundation of the Carabinieri, in 1814. Next to a smiling photo of Brigadier Cerciello Rega, an inscription read: “‘I’ll send you a kiss with the wind and I know that you’ll feel it.’ Your wife.”']",The killing of Deputy Brig. Mario Cerciello Rega last year has attracted significant media attention in Italy and the United States.
South Korea’s Most-Wanted Man Seized in New York,2020-07-23,By Choe Sang-Hun and Seamus Hughes,"['SEOUL, South Korea — One of South Korea’s most notorious fugitives was arrested in the United States this week on \u200b embezzlement charges \u200bat home stemming from the 2014 sinking of a ferry that killed more than 300 people, many of them high school students. Yoo Hyuk-kee, 48, was arrested on Wednesday without incident at his home in Westchester County, N.Y., in response to an extradition request that South Korea submitted to the United States, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. Mr. Yoo’s arrest ends \u200ba prolonged mystery over the whereabouts of the man South Korean investigators consider to be a central figure in the scandal surrounding the ferry’s sinking, which traumatized the nation. Prosecutors have said that rampant embezzlement by the Yoo family helped create unsafe conditions and practices on the Sewol ferry. Mr. Yoo, also\u200b known by his English name, Keith Yoo, is a son of Yoo Byung-eun, whose family controlled the Chonghaejin Marine Company, the operator of the Sewol. The overloaded ferry capsized off the southwestern tip of South Korea in April 2014\u200b in the country’s worst disaster in decades. Prosecutors later said that members of the Yoo family embezzled $169 million from a church that its patriarch \u200bhelped \u200bfound and from companies, including Chonghaejin, that were run with church funds and with loyal church members installed as business executives. By diverting money, which could have been used for safety measures, the family contributed to its sinking, prosecutors said. They \u200balso said that the ferry operator had routinely overloaded its ships, including the Sewol, in part to help make up for the losses incurred by the family’s embezzlement. On its last journey, the Sewol was carrying twice as much cargo as it was allowed. In a separate civil trial, a Seoul court in January ordered Mr. Yoo to pay $46 million in damages to the government but ruled that embezzlement was not a direct cause of the ship’s sinking. The investigation led South Korea to conduct its largest-ever manhunt for the family members. The senior Mr. Yoo was found dead. His eldest son, Yoo Dae-kyoon, spent two years in prison for illegally taking nearly $6.8 million since 2002 from seven companies controlled by his family, including the Chonghaejin company.

How the Cold War Between China and U.S. Is Intensifying,2020-07-22,By Rick Gladstone,"['Tensions between China and the United States have reached the most acute levels since the countries normalized diplomatic relations more than four decades ago, with the American government’s ordering that China close its Houston consulate being just the latest example. In defense, trade, technology, human rights and other categories, actions and reprisals by one side or the other have escalated sharply under President Trump’s administration, despite his repeated expressions of admiration for President Xi Jinping of China. The administration is even weighing a blanket ban on travel to the United States by the 92 million members of China’s ruling Communist Party and the possible expulsion of any members currently in the country, an action that would likely invite retaliation against American travel and residency in China. “I think we’re in a dangerous and precipitous spiral downward, not without cause, but without the proper diplomatic skills to arrest it,” said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. The severity of the confrontation, he said, “has jumped the wall from specific and solvable challenges to a clash of systems and values.” Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said he was alarmed by the increasing invective from two superpowers that together represent 40 percent of global economic output. “If we are yelling at each other and slamming doors, then the world is a very unstable place, and businesses are not able to plan,” he said. Here is a look at what has happened in the past few years to exacerbate the tensions: Mr. Trump and his subordinates have blamed China for spreading the coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. They have repeatedly described the virus in racist and stigmatizing terms, calling it the Wuhan virus, China virus and Kung Flu. On July 4, Mr. Trump said China “must be held fully accountable.” The administration also has defunded and ordered a severing of ties with the World Health Organization, accusing it of having abetted shortcomings in China’s initial response to the outbreak. On Tuesday, the Justice Department accused Chinese hackers of attempting to steal information about American research on a virus vaccine. For its part, China has rejected the administration’s attacks over the virus and has criticized the poor American government response to the outbreak. Chinese propagandists also have promoted the countertheory, with no evidence, that American soldiers may have been the original source of the virus during a visit to Wuhan last October. Mr. Trump won office in 2016 partly on his accusations that China was exploiting the country’s trade relationship with the United States by selling the country far more than it purchased. In office, he decreed a series of punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, and China retaliated, in a trade war that has now lasted more than two years. While a truce was effectively declared in January with the signing of what the administration called a ‘Phase 1’ trade deal, most tariffs were not eased. The Trump administration has increasingly challenged China’s assertions of sovereignty and control over much of the South China Sea, including vital maritime shipping lanes. Just last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has described China as a major security threat, decreed that most of China’s claims in the South China Sea are “completely unlawful,” setting up potential military confrontations between Chinese and U.S. naval forces in the Pacific. China has long been accused by successive U.S. administrations of stealing American technology. The Trump White House has escalated the accusations further by seeking an international blacklisting of Huawei, China’s largest technology company, calling it a front for China’s efforts to infiltrate the telecommunications infrastructure of other nations for strategic advantage. The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, has been detained in Canada since December 2018 on an extradition warrant to the United States on fraud charges. Last week Britain declared it was siding with the United States in barring Huawei products from its high-speed wireless network. Accusing China’s state-run media outlets of fomenting propaganda, the Trump administration sharply limited the number of Chinese citizens who could work for Chinese news organizations in the United States. China retaliated by ordering the expulsions of journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, and took other steps that suggested further impediments to American press access in China were looming. The New York Times, concerned about the possibility of further limitations on journalists working in China, announced last week that it was relocating much of its major news hub in Hong Kong to Seoul, South Korea. The Trump administration has taken steps to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers in the United States who have direct ties to universities affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army, according to American officials knowledgeable about the planning. Such expulsions portend possible further educational restrictions, and the Chinese government could retaliate by imposing its own visa bans on Americans. Last November, Mr. Trump, with bipartisan support, signed legislation that could penalize Chinese and Hong Kong officials who suppress dissent by democracy advocates in Hong Kong, the former British colony and Asian financial center that was guaranteed some measure of autonomy by China. In May Mr. Trump said he was taking steps to end Hong Kong’s preferential trading status with the United States after China passed a sweeping new security law that could be used to stifle any form of expression deemed seditious by China. The Chinese authorities have denounced the measures and vowed to retaliate. This month the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a number of Chinese officials, including a senior member of the Communist Party, over human rights abuses by China in the Xinjiang region against the country’s largely Muslim Uighur minority. Beijing promised retaliation against American institutions and individuals it deemed guilty of “egregious” conduct in issues concerning Xinjiang, a vast Western expanse in China where the authorities have placed a million people in labor camps and imposed intrusive surveillance on others. For the Chinese government, American actions taken in the name of defending people living anywhere in China constitute blatant interference in its internal politics — a grievance with deep-seated roots going back to its struggles with imperialist powers in the 19th century. In May the Trump administration approved a $180 million arms sale to Taiwan, part of a far bigger arms deal that has angered the Chinese authorities, who regard the self-governing island as part of China. Another longstanding source of Chinese anger is the American deference to the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader-in-exile of Tibet, the former Himalayan kingdom in China’s far west. In 2018 Mr. Trump signed a bill that penalizes Chinese officials who restrict American officials, journalists and other citizens from going freely to Tibetan areas. Last November the State Department’s ambassador at large for international religious freedom, Samuel D. Brownback, warned that only Tibetans could choose the successor to the Dalai Lama, who turned 85 this month, setting up a new clash with Beijing, which contends it will choose his successor.']","In defense, trade, technology, media and diplomacy, among other areas, the rancor between the Trump administration and China’s ruling Communist Party is  worsening."
1920: Police Retaliate After Killings in Ireland,2020-07-21,By The International Herald Tribune,"['(By Special Leased Wire.) LONDON, Tuesday. — Following the shooting of Constables Craig and Burke, the cathedral town of Tuam went through a “perfect hell,” in the words of a resident, during the early hours of to-day. The police, having viewed the dead bodies of their comrades at the station, appear to have got completely out of hand. Fully armed they marched into the streets, smashed saloons, looting their contents, dragged young men out of bed and threatened to shoot them. Then they set fire to some of the most valuable properties in the township, causing damage to the extent of £100,000. Inhabitants in Panic. The inhabitants were first aroused by shooting and the explosion of hand-grenades. In a panic the women and children sought refuge in the rear of houses, many of which were subjected to a fusillade. Soldiers stationed in Tuam came on the scene but were withdrawn, their officers being heard to shout “This is not our job!” About five o’clock the firing died down, and townsmen who ventured abroad found many houses in flames. Some difficulty was experienced in getting the fire-hose to play on the burning buildings, as the water supply is cut off during the night. Strenuous work saved a great portion of the town from destruction. The Town Hall was burnt and a dozen shops were wrecked. At Cardonagh to-day the court-house was burned down. It was here that Joseph O. Doherty, Sinn Fein M.P. for North Donegal, was to be tried. The destruction of this court-house makes the third case of this kind within a fortnight. At Galway last night a band of fifty men attacked an automobile which was conveying four police officers. In the struggle which ensued, two of the officers were killed, and the others, after exhausting their ammunition, were captured and taken to Tuam.

The money was handed in at the headquarters of the company by a priest, who also tendered a statement to the effect that the “Republic police” had traced and arrested the robbers and hand deducted £28, 10s, for expenses. The statement adds that the money was recovered at considerable risk to the police, and its return shows “that clean, straight justice to all within the Irish Republic can be expected.” — The New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 21, 1920.']","The town of Tuam was ransacked by the police, with buildings looted and set alight, in response to the shooting of two officers."
Ukraine Gunman Frees Captives After Documentary Demand Is Met,2020-07-21,By Andrew E. Kramer,"['MOSCOW — A nearly 12-hour standoff in Ukraine between the police and an armed hostage-taker who demanded, among other things, that the country’s president publicly endorse a documentary about animal abuse ended with the man’s capture on Tuesday. After speaking by phone with the man, who was holding 13 hostages while armed with an automatic weapon and explosives, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged Ukrainians to watch the documentary. “Everybody watch the 2005 film ‘Earthlings,’” Mr. Zelensky said in a terse statement posted on Facebook. The documentary, narrated by the American actor Joaquin Phoenix, depicts animals suffering in industrial agriculture and in scientific research. Authorities identified the hostage-taker as a 44-year-old former convict, Maksim Krivosh, who used the nickname Maksim the Bad to post a manifesto and demands on Twitter. The rambling demands, including the assertion that the government was a terrorist organization, seemed not directly related to Ukraine’s turbulent internal politics, as they are usually understood, or its six-year-old war with Russian-backed separatists. “Happy day of the anti-system,” Mr. Krivosh wrote in one post. “Don’t fool yourselves.” In a video posted online he wore a black beret and cradled a shortened version of a Kalashnikov rifle. He asked that members of Parliament, ministers and leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church post messages saying, “I am a legal terrorist.” None of the 13 hostages held in a city bus through the tense ordeal were physically harmed, authorities said, though several shots were fired, leaving bullet holes in the bus windows. Mr. Krivosh specifically demanded that Mr. Zelensky endorse the “Earthlings” documentary. He also showed the documentary to his hostages on the bus, local news media reported. Videos and photographs from the scene in Lutsk, a town in northwestern Ukraine, showed police officers shooing pedestrians away from the bus. Security forces were seen taking cover behind utility poles and police cars. Residents of nearby apartment buildings were evacuated. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Zelensky had said in a statement that a man had called the police to announce that he had captured the bus. He said he would try to resolve the standoff without bloodshed. Mr. Zelensky’s endorsement of “Earthlings” could be seen as complying with a terrorist’s demand. But it also fit into what his office said was a negotiating strategy of trying, above all else, to avoid angering a heavily armed man with hostages. Mr. Zelensky, in a statement issued after the hostages were released, suggested that he didn’t mind appearing to lose face if it saved lives. “We were not fighting for ratings,” he said. “We were fighting for lives.” He deleted the post endorsing the film. Three people were released after the president and the hostage-taker spoke by phone, with the remaining hostages freed after Mr. Zelensky posted his statement about “Earthlings.” Mr. Krivosh then surrendered, the police said. It is unclear how Mr. Krivosh obtained his weapons. But in the early years of the separatist war in eastern Ukraine, volunteers in paramilitary groups did much of the fighting on the Ukrainian side. Over the years, some military weapons that they carried at the front, including automatic rifles, hand grenades and other explosives, went missing from arsenals and have been used in crimes far from the front line, including domestic violence. The spread of weapons from the war and relatively lax gun laws have meant Ukraine has a higher prevalence of guns in society than do other European nations.

Former Nazi Guard Is Convicted in One of Germany’s Last Holocaust Trials,2020-07-23,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — A German court convicted a 93-year-old man on Thursday for helping the Nazis murder thousands of people while he served as a concentration camp guard more than 75 years ago, in what might be one of the last verdicts to be handed down to a living participant in the Holocaust. The Hamburg state court found Bruno Dey guilty of 5,230 counts of accessory to murder — one for each person believed to have been killed in the Stutthof concentration camp, east of Gdansk in Poland, during the time he served as a guard there, from August 1944 to April 1945. Mr. Dey, who was tried in juvenile court because he was only 17 years old at the time, was given a two-year suspended sentence, reflecting the prosecutors’ acknowledgment of his contrition and willingness to cooperate with authorities. But survivors and those representing them criticized the sentence as too lenient. “It is unsatisfactory and much too late,” said Christoph Heubner of the International Auschwitz Committee, who followed the trial. “What is so upsetting for survivors is that this defendant failed to use the many postwar years of his life to reflect on what he saw and heard.” The trial against Mr. Dey was the latest in a push by prosecutors in the special office for handling Nazi-era crimes to bring aging suspects to justice before it is too late. And it came at a moment when the country is struggling to deal with a resurgence in right-wing extremism. Mr. Dey appeared at the Hamburg state court, seated in a wheelchair and wearing a blue surgical mask because of the coronavirus outbreak. He cast his eyes downward as the judge read his sentence, according to German public media. “You still see yourself as a mere observer, when in fact you were an accomplice to this man-made hell,” presiding judge Anne Meier-Goering told the defendant while reading the verdict. “You did not follow an order to carry out a crime and should not have inferred this.” In a closing statement, Mr. Dey said he felt it was important to express his thoughts and feelings about what he had learned during the trial, but also argued that he had been forced to serve as a concentration camp SS guard and was ordered into the position. “The witness testimony and the expert assessments made me realize the full scope of the horrors and suffering,” he told the court. “Today I would like to apologize for those who went through the hell of this insanity. Something like this must never happen again.” The German authorities have intensified their efforts in recent years to hold to account men and women, most of them now over 90, who played smaller roles in helping the Nazis round up and murder Europe’s Jews in their network of concentration and death camps. Throughout the Cold War, these people were overlooked by a justice system that demanded evidence of direct involvement of a Nazi-era crime in order to bring charges against a perpetrator. As the survivors grew older a reunited Germany began emphasizing the importance of remembrance and atonement, giving a prominent place to a Holocaust memorial in the heart of its new capital and establishing funds worth millions to compensate long overlooked victims of Nazi crimes. Over the past decades, the courts, too, have shifted their perspective, following landmark rulings in 2011 and 2015 that established that individuals who played supporting roles in Nazi crimes could be convicted on the argument of association. Last week, another former guard from Stutthof, age 95, was charged with similar crimes. Because Mr. Dey was only 17 when he began his guard duties, he was tried as a juvenile. Prosecutors had sought a three-year prison sentence for his role at the camp, where he was tasked with making sure that none of the inmates, mostly Polish Jews and political prisoners, escaped. More than 60,000 people — roughly half of whom were Jews — are believed to have died or been killed at the camp, which was the first to be established by the Nazi regime outside of Germany’s borders. Located in the small Polish town of Sztutowo, it served as a prison camp after the invasion of Poland in 1939. Gas chambers were put into use in 1944, and the camp was one of the last to be liberated. More than three dozen survivors testified in the trial, which began in October. They told the court of seeing relatives die in the electric fences that surrounded the Stutthof camp, collecting the bones of other victims and being chased from their barracks, naked in subzero temperatures. Mr. Dey acknowledged hearing screams from the camp’s gas chambers and watching as corpses were taken to be burned. But he said he never fired his weapon and that the “images of misery and horror have haunted me my entire life.” For Mr. Heubner, of the International Auschwitz Committee, who volunteered at Stutthof during the 1970s and attended several sessions of Mr. Dey’s trial as an observer, the statement rang hollow. “The image of him sitting above the camp in his tower is reflective of the view he had of himself as above those who were suffering,” he said. “And although he had decades to confront the horrors of what he witnessed, he remained silent.” Stefan Waterkamp, Mr. Dey’s attorney, argued for his client to be acquitted. He said Mr. Dey did not become a guard by choice and that trying to flee or resist duty would have put him in danger. “How could an 18-year-old step out of line in a situation like this?” Mr. Waterkamp said as part of his closing argument. Judge Meier-Goering said the lesson of the trial must be to “honor human dignity at all costs — even when the price is your own safety.” Germany continues to struggle with this maxim, as far-right activity has surged in the country in the past year. Earlier this week, a different German court opened a trial against a 28-year-old German suspected of plotting to blast his way into a synagogue filled with Jews observing Yom Kippur an attack that failed but left two people dead and injured several others. The attack was the most severe of thousands of crimes committed against Jews in Germany in 2019 — the worst year since the country started tracking them in 2001. Prosecutors said the defendant in that trial, Stephan Balliet, had been motivated by a belief that “the root of all these problems is the Jew.”']","The 93-year-old defendant was convicted of 5,230 counts of accessory to murder — one for each person’s death while he was at the Stutthof camp — but was tried in juvenile court, because he was 17 at the time."
"Beijing’s Tightrope: Stand Tough, but Avoid a Full Rupture With the U.S.",2020-07-23,By Keith Bradsher and Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — Two weeks ago, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, pleaded with the United States to step back from the brink and find ways to work together. Just days later, he complained to his Russian counterpart that the United States had “lost its mind, morals and credibility.” The question now is what China can do about it. The Trump administration’s broad assault on China has left its leadership with few options that would not threaten a complete breach in relations. If that happened, it could leave Beijing even more isolated at a time when China is also clashing with India, Britain, Canada, Australia and many other countries. It could also hurt the Chinese economy when it is already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and the global fallout. The order on Tuesday to close the Chinese Consulate in Houston with only 72 hours’ notice was only the latest action by the administration that has infuriated officials in China. In a matter of weeks, Beijing has endured a stepped-up campaign against its 5G wireless technology, sanctions against officials overseeing Hong Kong and the largely Muslim region of Xinjiang, and now accusations that China has dispatched scores of soldiers under cover to steal commercial, military and even medical secrets. A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry vowed again on Thursday that the government would retaliate in kind to the closure. He dismissed the administration’s accusations as “a malicious smearing.” On Friday, Beijing hit back, telling the United States it must shut down its consulate in Chengdu, the westernmost of the five American consulates in mainland China. The furor is inflaming anti-American sentiment in China and emboldening more hawkish voices. Nationalists are calling for China to go further than a measured tit-for-tat response and even consider shutting down the American Consulate in Hong Kong. “Let them sweat,” Hu Xijin, the editor of The Global Times, a nationalist Communist Party newspaper, wrote of American diplomats in the embassy and six consulates. He said the mission in Hong Kong was “obviously” an intelligence center, while vastly exaggerating the size of the staff. He then referred to the frantic reaction to the closure at the Houston consulate, where people could be seen in a courtyard burning documents in metal bins. “Have each of their consulates make an emergency plan, pack up all the files and prepare to burn.” Behind the scenes, senior Chinese officials seem to have little desire to escalate the tensions even further, concerned that any moves could play into President Trump’s hands as he mounts his re-election campaign. A highly visible showdown with China could distract Americans from Mr. Trump’s botched response to the pandemic and allow him to campaign as a leader who is defending his country against a foreign power. “This is a classic game, to find an external distraction and rouse the people behind the president,” said Lau Siu-kai, a senior Beijing adviser on Hong Kong issues. At the same time, Beijing cannot afford to appear weak in the face of the barrage of attacks from the United States. A rising sense of national pride, instilled by the country’s schools and amplified by state media, demands that Chinese leaders stand strong when challenged from abroad. “China needs to protect its own honor and sovereignty,” said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai. Wang Wenbin, the foreign ministry’s spokesman, made clear at the ministry’s daily briefing on Thursday that Chinese officials were acutely aware of their dilemma. “We are not interested in interfering in the U.S. election; we also hope that the U.S. side will not play the China card in the election,” he said, while immediately cautioning the Trump administration as well. “We advise the U.S. side not to make mistakes again and again, otherwise China will certainly make a legitimate and necessary response.” Rising tensions with Washington have laid bare divisions in Beijing over how to respond to a confrontation that has become even broader and more aggressive than Chinese officials expected only weeks ago. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, delivering a speech Thursday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in California, said the Trump administration would persist in challenging China around the globe. He did not mention any issues of common interest or grounds for constructive engagement. “General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology,” Mr. Pompeo said, referring to the Chinese leader. He added, “I call on every leader of every nation to start by doing what America has done — to simply insist on reciprocity, to insist on transparency, and on accountability from the Chinese Communist Party.” On one side are officials in the country’s security services and the military who oppose any conciliatory stance that might be interpreted by the United States as weakness, according to several people involved in Chinese policymaking who spoke on the condition of anonymity, given the diplomatic sensitivities. Other officials, generally those focused on the economy, have sought a more measured response to the American actions — keeping the trade truce intact, for example. Even after the closing of the Houston consulate, China remains committed to the so-called Phase 1 trade agreement with the United States signed on Jan. 15, the people familiar with Chinese policymaking said. If China wanted to hurt Mr. Trump in the election campaign, Beijing could halt the large purchases of American food that it agreed to make as part of the trade truce negotiated before the pandemic broke out. That would penalize American farmers, who could prove an important voting bloc in some states. So far, China has kept buying large quantities of American corn, wheat, sorghum and pork this summer, said Darin Friedrichs, an agricultural commodities specialist in the Shanghai office of INTL FCStone, a large Chicago trading firm. Less than two weeks ago, China made its largest single purchase ever of American corn, just four days after another major transaction. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, remains the ultimate arbiter of the policy debate in Beijing, but has not spoken out on the deterioration in relations. On Wednesday, when the closing of the consulate became public, he toured distant Jilin Province, seemingly undisturbed by the diplomatic confrontation. On Thursday, he visited the Air Force Aviation University, talking instead about China’s national celebration of its military in August. “Beijing’s policy has always been adjusted by Xi himself,” said Wu Qiang, an independent analyst in Beijing. “He steps on the gas himself and then hits the brake himself.” The Chinese appear to have been taken aback by the sharp deterioration in relations. In a speech on July 9, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, appeared to outline a path for stabilizing relations. “President Xi Jinping has underlined on many occasions that we have a thousand reasons to make the China-U.S. relationship a success, and none whatsoever to wreck it,” he said. “As long as both sides have the positive will to improve and grow this relationship, we will find ways to steer this relationship out of the difficulties and bring it back to the right track.” Instead, the Chinese faced confrontation on a multitude of new fronts. In the latest salvo over the consulate, the Trump administration accused Chinese diplomats of aiding economic espionage and the attempted theft of scientific research in numerous cases across the United States. Chinese officials angrily denounced the closure of the consulate, calling it a provocation that would further undermine already soured relations. Cai Wei, China’s top diplomat in Houston, said the move against the consulate, the first Beijing opened in the United States after re-establishing ties in 1979, was “very damaging.” In previous tense moments, the two leaders, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, sometimes smoothed over differences with a long phone call or a meeting. It has happened in the past when trade fights boiled over, as well as early in the coronavirus outbreak, when the rhetoric between both sides intensified. The tone now in Washington, though, has worsened. And Mr. Trump no longer seems interested in defusing the crisis. “Xi Jinping could take the initiative instead,” said Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. “Xi could also demonstrate China’s benign intentions by inviting the U.S. to join with it in leading an international effort to plan now for the testing, manufacture and fair distribution of Covid vaccine.” The tough policies and tougher rhetoric from Washington indicate that the United States, not China, is setting the ever more confrontational tone in the bilateral relationship. “I think originally you could have faulted the Chinese for much of the imbalance,” said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society, “but now the U.S. doesn’t seem as ardent about leaving the door open for remedy, as it is arching its back against China.” Given the breadth of American actions and increasingly bipartisan support, it is not clear that China can hope for an improvement even if Mr. Trump’s challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., wins the election. Mr. Schell noted that as vice president, Mr. Biden met with Mr. Xi frequently, even traveling together. “There’s a kind of symmetry there that he could use to recast the relationship,” he said. “The real question is whether Xi can respond the same way — whether giving a little to get a little is seen as weakness.” “I do think that Biden and his people are perfectly capable of working out a new balance point,” he added. “I have much less confidence that China will find that easy to do.” Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul, South Korea.

China Uses W.H.O. Inquiry to Tout Coronavirus Response,2020-07-21,By Javier C. Hernández and Amy Qin,"['Chinese officials are hailing a visit by a team of experts sent to Beijing by the World Health Organization to investigate the source of the coronavirus as evidence that the country is a responsible and transparent global power. But the investigation by the W.H.O. is likely to take many months and could face delays. For starters, there are logistical headaches. China has placed the advance team of experts who are laying the groundwork for a broader investigation under a standard 14-day quarantine, forcing them to do some of their detective work from a distance. “Obviously the arrival and quarantine of individuals and working remotely is not the ideal way to work, but we fully respect the risk-management procedures put in place,” Mike Ryan, the W.H.O.’s chief of emergency response, said at a news conference on Friday. He said it would take weeks before a full team would be able to visit China. The W.H.O.’s investigation comes as China faces intense global backlash, including from the United States, for initially downplaying and failing to contain the virus, which emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. For weeks, China had fiercely resisted demands from other nations that it allow independent investigators onto its soil to study the origin of the pathogen. Beijing has also tried to deflect blame by suggesting, without evidence, that the virus could have originated elsewhere. Now, officials are trumpeting Beijing’s response to the outbreak as a model for the world and attacking the United States for “shirking its responsibilities” in the global fight against Covid-19. The Trump administration, which has repeatedly attempted to distract from its ineffective response to the pandemic, has criticized the W.H.O.’s inquiry. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently said that he expected it to be a “completely whitewashed investigation.” With relations between China and Western countries deteriorating rapidly over military, technology, trade and human rights concerns, experts worry that Beijing will seek to limit the scope of the research so that it does not embarrass the government. “The whole political landscape is not favorable to doing an unbiased scientific investigation,” said Wang Linfa, a virologist in Singapore who took part in a similar W.H.O. study in China during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. “I feel sorry for the team members.” The Chinese government initially covered up the SARS outbreak, but Mr. Wang said it was later eager to cooperate with the international experts. This time, he said, the W.H.O.’s investigation was likely to be largely symbolic because the broader geopolitical climate could make Chinese experts unwilling to share valuable research. Chinese officials have provided little data from samples that the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention took in December at the Huanan Seafood Market, a sprawling market in Wuhan that sold game meat and live animals, where many of the first reported infections were traced. The market has since been closed and scrubbed down. The W.H.O.’s inquiry is focused on the question of how the disease jumped to humans from animals. The advance team is made up of an expert in animal health, as well as an epidemiologist. The team members, who arrived in mid-July, have not yet been identified and have not spoken publicly. Dr. Ryan said on Friday that the health organization was “very pleased with the collaboration on the ground.” He said earlier in the month that the experts would not do field investigations but would meet with Chinese officials and researchers to review the available data and outline the scope of the inquiry. For months, China and the United States have been locked in a political fight over the virus, with officials in each accusing the other of intentionally unleashing the virus on the world. Despite unfounded conspiracy theories that the virus was man-made, experts say Covid-19 is caused by a coronavirus that almost certainly originated naturally in animals, most likely bats. But they do not know where it came from, what the exact chain of transmission is and how many times the spillover to humans from animals has occurred. For a while, pangolins were thought to be a possible intermediate host. More recent analysis has shown that while they may have played a role in the development of the virus, there is no evidence that they were the immediate source. While the Chinese government has said it welcomes an inquiry, officials have not yet provided details about their own efforts to trace the origins of the virus. Research into the matter has in several cases been blocked or delayed, Chinese scientists say. Chinese officials have sought to reframe the W.H.O.’s visit as a sign of China’s confidence and strength, especially compared to the United States, making the dubious claim that China first requested it. (Countries such as Australia had pushed for such an inquiry.) Reports in the state-run news media have described the visit by the W.H.O. as a reflection of China’s “open attitude.” “It is our contribution to global public health cooperation as a responsible major country,” Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said this month at a news conference. Mr. Zhao called on the United States to allow a similar investigation, even though there is no evidence the virus originated in America. He criticized the United States for moving forward with plans to withdraw from the W.H.O. over concerns that the health agency is too close to China. “The U.S. has been shirking its own responsibilities and undermining global solidarity in combating the virus by declaring its exit from the W.H.O., politicizing matters related to the pandemic and smearing others,” he said. Chinese officials and experts have continued to call on the W.H.O. to widen its analysis to include other countries. Wang Guangfa, a top government health adviser, has said that the W.H.O. should also go to Spain. Mr. Wang, speaking this month with The Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese tabloid, cited an unpublished study by researchers at the University of Barcelona that suggested the virus was present in Spain’s wastewater as early as March 2019. Independent experts have said that the study was flawed and that other lines of evidence strongly suggest the virus broke out in China late last year. Officials from the W.H.O. have said that Wuhan is the best starting point for scrutinizing the animal origin of the virus because it was where the first clusters of the outbreak emerged in humans. But they remained open to other lines of study, as well. “We have to keep an open mind,” Dr. Ryan said at a news briefing this month. “Science must stay open to all possibilities.” The W.H.O.’s research could take months, if not longer. Scientists took several years to conclude that horseshoe bats were the most likely hosts in nature for the coronavirus that caused SARS in 2002. Before that, researchers had identified masked palm civets as one of the primary intermediate hosts after the virus was identified in several civets that were being sold in markets in Guangdong. The inquiry also offers an opportunity for the W.H.O. to rehabilitate its own image. While the agency has been praised for its efforts to coordinate treatment and vaccine development, it has also been assailed for being too trusting of China and for not pushing Chinese health officials on their early missteps. The organization is dependent on its member states for information, and publicly challenging those countries could put it at risk of getting cut off from data that it needs to operate and respond quickly to outbreaks. Critics say that the W.H.O.’s kneejerk tendency to praise its member states makes it easy for governments, including China, to co-opt the agency for propaganda purposes. Yanzhong Huang, an expert on public health in China at the Council on Foreign Relations, said both China and the W.H.O. faced growing pressure for a comprehensive examination of what happened, but that it was unclear if they could deliver. He noted that it was still uncertain if the team of experts allowed to visit China would include representatives from countries that have rebuked China, including the United States and Australia, and whether they would have full access to records, sites and laboratories. “In a nutshell,” he said, “it remains unclear whether a thorough and objective investigation is possible.”']","The global health agency sent two experts to China, but it is unclear how much access they are getting. They must first complete a two-week quarantine."
"Trump, in a Departure, Says Virus Will Get Worse",2020-07-21,,"['Follow our live updates of coronavirus cases and deaths globally. President Trump abruptly departed on Tuesday from his rosy projections about the coronavirus, warning Americans from the White House briefing lectern that the illness would get worse before widespread recovery. “It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,” Mr. Trump said. “Something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.” In his first virus-focused televised news conference since late April, Mr. Trump appeared before reporters to defend his track record, which has been widely criticized for his tendency to downplay the severity of the pandemic. Appearing without Vice President Mike Pence, Dr. Deborah Birx or Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, key members of his White House coronavirus task force, Mr. Trump also implored citizens — especially young people — to wear masks. “Get a mask,” said Mr. Trump, who has been reluctant to wear them in public himself. “Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They will have an effect and we need everything we can get.” Mr. Trump’s comment urging Americans to wear masks was a stunning departure from his past comments on wearing them. In recent weeks, he has disparaged masks as unsanitary and suggested that people who wore them were making a political statement against him. Mr. Trump’s less dismissive comments about the pandemic reflected a dawning realization within his team that the virus not only is not going away but has badly damaged his standing with the public heading into the election in November. Approval of his handling of the pandemic has fallen from 51 percent in late March to 38 percent last week in polling by The Washington Post and ABC News. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee who now leads Mr. Trump by double digits, has assailed him in recent days for ignoring a devastating threat to the United States. In an interview shortly before Mr. Trump’s news conference, Dr. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said that he had not been invited to attend and defended himself against comments Mr. Trump had made in a Fox News interview Sunday, when he called him “little bit of an alarmist.” “People have their opinion about my reaction to things,” Dr. Fauci said in the interview on CNN on Tuesday afternoon. “I consider myself more of a realist than an alarmist.” At the White House, Mr. Trump detailed what he said was data that put the United States in a better position to defeat the virus than other countries dealing with the pandemic. At one point, he repeated the false claim that the United States has a lower fatality rate than “almost everywhere else in the world.” The country, according to a New York Times database, has the world’s 10th highest rate of reported deaths per 100,000 people. Mr. Trump also claimed “no governor needs anything right now,” contradicting the public accounts of a few governors. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon told PBS last night that “we need help with testing supplies and equipment” while Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland warned of testing shortages earlier on Tuesday. Asked about a tweet he sent a day earlier, in which he declared mask-wearing as “patriotic,” Mr. Trump did not explain why he often declined to wear one in public. “If you’re close to each other, if you’re in a group, I would put it on when I’m in a group,” Mr. Trump said. But he did not directly answer when asked why he had not worn a mask during a small group gathering at the Trump International Hotel in Washington the evening before, and appeared to toggle back and forth between his own feelings about mask-wearing as he spoke. “I’m getting used to the mask and the reason is, think about patriotism. Maybe it helps,” Mr. Trump said. But even as he acknowledged that the outbreak would worsen, the president continued to maintain, without evidence, that “the virus will disappear.” At least 1,120 coronavirus deaths were reported across the United States on Tuesday, the first time in July the single-day total had exceeded 1,000. With the exception of two days in late June when New Jersey and New York reported large numbers of deaths from unknown dates, Tuesday’s total was the highest since May 29, according to a New York Times database. Officials in Nevada, Oregon and Tennessee reported their highest single-day death figures yet. Public health experts have warned for weeks that deaths would trail new cases by about a month and case counts have risen substantially since mid-June, when states began lifting stay-at-home orders and reopening businesses.   Tuesday’s total was far below the single-day record of 2,752, reported on April 15 during the peak of the outbreak in New York and the Northeast.  The seven-day average of deaths in the United States reached 810 on Tuesday, up from an average of about 475 in early July, though still far below the country’s April peak. The United States military has emerged as a potential source of coronavirus transmissions both domestically and abroad, according to military and local public health officials. Over 20,000 members have contracted the virus, and the infection rate in the armed services has tripled over the past six weeks. Cases are rising the most on military bases in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas, all states that have seen surges in infections, Jennifer Steinhauer and Thomas Gibbons-Neff of The New York Times reported. At a base in Okinawa, Japan, the U.S. Marine Corps has reported nearly 100 cases, enraging local officials. And in war zones such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, already awash with untracked cases, U.S. troops have contended with outbreaks of the virus within their ranks. Domestically, local officials in Georgia’s Chattahoochee County, a sparsely populated area with high infection rates, traced the outbreaks to Fort Benning, the large training base there. And officials in California and North Carolina have also seen connections between military installations and communities. The rise of cases among a largely young population that lives in dense quarters near cities where bars and other crowded places that have been opened is unsurprising. But the increase raises questions about the military’s safety precautions as the Pentagon wrestles with both containing the virus within the ranks while also addressing logistical problems it has created, like relieving units that had been stuck overseas for longer than expected. There were 21,909 cases in the military as of Monday, compared with 7,408 on June 10, according to the Pentagon. Three service members have died since March, including a sailor on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. More than 440 service members have been hospitalized. The number of people infected with the coronavirus in different parts of the United States has been anywhere from two to 13 times higher than the reported rates for those regions, according to data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings suggest that large numbers of people who did not have symptoms or did not seek medical care may have kept the virus circulating in their communities. The study is the largest of its kind to date, although some early data was released last month. “These data continue to show that the number of people who have been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 far exceeds the number of reported cases,” Dr. Fiona Havers, the C.D.C. researcher who led the study, said in an email. “Many of these people likely had no symptoms or mild illness and may have had no idea that they were infected.” The researchers analyzed samples from people who had routine clinical tests, or were inpatients at hospitals, in 10 cities and states for evidence of prior virus infection. The team released early data for six of the sites in June, and for all 10 locations Tuesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. They also released data from later times for eight sites to the C.D.C.’s website on Tuesday. About 40 percent of infected people do not develop symptoms, but they may still pass the virus on to others. The United States now tests roughly 700,000 people a day. The new results highlight the need for much more testing to detect infection levels and contain the viral spread in parts of the country. For example, in Missouri, the prevalence of infections as of May 30 was 2.8 percent or 171,000, 13 times the reported rate of 12,956 cases, suggesting that the state missed most people with the virus who might have contributed to its outsized outbreak. In some regions, the gap between estimated infections and reported cases decreased as testing capacity and reporting improved. New York City, for example, showed a 12-fold difference between actual infections and reported cases in early April, but by early May the difference was down to tenfold. The study indicates that even the hardest-hit area in the study — New York City, where nearly one in four people has been exposed to the virus — is nowhere near achieving herd immunity, the level of exposure at which the spread of the virus would start to dwindle on its own. To reach that level, experts believe at least 60 percent of people in a particular place would have had to be exposed to the virus. U.S. ROUNDUP When millions of Americans began losing their jobs in March, the federal government stepped in with a life preserver: $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits. That life preserver will disappear within days if Congress does not act to extend it. Republican leaders labored on Tuesday to avert a party revolt over the next round of coronavirus aid, announcing that they planned to provide $105 billion for schools, direct payments to American families and more aid for struggling small businesses. Even as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, divulged details of his emerging plan, which is expected to be worth roughly $1 trillion, President Trump had yet to sign on and Republicans remained deeply divided over several key elements. Ahead of what are expected to be difficult negotiations with Democrats, Senate Republicans and White House officials were fighting over how much money to devote to testing and to the federal health agencies on the front lines of the virus response; whether to include a payroll tax cut that Mr. Trump has demanded; and how to address the expiration of the enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of the month. Top Republican officials privately cautioned that the coming negotiation was likely to stretch into August, leaving tens of millions of unemployed Americans without extra help, potentially prompting a wave of evictions and further damaging the economy. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump offered a positive assessment of the economy. “We are in a pandemic, and yet we are producing tremendous numbers of jobs,” he said during his first virus-focused news conference in weeks. “That was something nobody thought possible,” he said, later adding that he expected the next few quarters to look even better, predicting a “record year.” While it is true that nearly five million positions were brought back in June, over all the United States is still down around 14.7 million jobs since February. New York, grappling with how to prevent another large outbreak, will now require travelers from a total of 31 states to quarantine for 14 days, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Tuesday. The weekly update saw Minnesota taken off the list and the addition of 10 states: Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Virginia and Washington. New Jersey and Connecticut are also requiring travelers from those 31 states to quarantine. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut signed an executive order on Tuesday to mandate the self-isolation, with failure to comply punishable by a $1,000 fine. The top public official in hard-hit Hidalgo County, Texas, ordered residents on Monday to stay at home, imposed a curfew and implored all but essential businesses to shut down. But the order lacked any means of enforcement, a situation that has frustrated local officials across Texas. As Gov. Greg Abbott prepared to reopen the state in April, he blocked local officials from issuing enforceable stay-at-home orders. Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced a sweeping new $775 billion investment in caregiving programs on Tuesday, with a series of proposals covering care for small children, older adults and family members with disabilities. Mississippi on Tuesday reported more than 1,630 cases, a single-day record for the state.  Executives from four companies in the race to produce a coronavirus vaccine told lawmakers on Tuesday that they are optimistic their products could be ready by the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021. All four companies — AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Pfizer — are testing proprietary vaccines in various phases of human clinical trials. Arizona is averaging more than 3,000 new cases a day this month, double what it was in mid-June. The state’s death toll is steadily climbing to nearly 3,000. But disease specialists are expressing cautious optimism that the crisis there may be leveling off or even starting to ebb. A study of patients in New York published in the journal JAMA reports that blood clotting problems may be significantly more common among Covid-19 patients than among those with other infectious diseases. And patients with blood-clotting problems were twice as likely to die, the study found. The U.S. Justice Department accused a pair of Chinese hackers on Tuesday of targeting vaccine development on behalf of the country’s intelligence service. Justice Department officials called the suspects a blended threat who sometimes worked on behalf of China’s spy services and sometimes worked to enrich themselves. The officials said that an indictment secured against them earlier this month and unsealed on Tuesday was the first to target such a threat. The hacking was part of a broader, yearslong campaign of cybertheft by the pair aimed at an array of industries. American government officials said that at the behest of China’s spy service, the two hackers shifted their focus this year to trying to acquire vaccine research and other information about the pandemic. The indictment came as the Trump administration has stepped up its criticism of Beijing, both for its theft of secrets and its failure to contain the spread of the virus, and is a significant escalation of that effort. The Justice Department said that China’s covert activity could potentially set back research efforts. The accusations also came days after the United States and allied countries accused Russia of trying to steal information on vaccine development. Global Roundup South Korea has been praised for making effective use of digital tools to contain the virus, from emergency phone alerts to aggressive contact tracing based on a variety of data. But one pillar of that strategy, a mobile app that helps enforce quarantines, had serious security flaws that made private information vulnerable to hackers, a software engineer has found. The defects, which were confirmed by The New York Times and have been fixed, could have let attackers retrieve the names, real-time locations and other details of people in quarantine. The flaws could also have allowed hackers to tamper with data to make it look as if users of the app were either violating quarantine orders or still in quarantine despite being somewhere else. In April, South Korea began requiring all visitors and residents arriving from abroad to isolate themselves for two weeks. To monitor compliance, they had to install an app with a name in Korean that means Self-Quarantine Safety Protection. As of last month, more than 162,000 people had downloaded the app, which tracks users’ locations to ensure they remain in designated quarantine areas. Violators might be required to wear tracking wristbands or pay steep fines. “We were really in a hurry to make and deploy this app as quickly as possible to help slow down the spread of the virus,” said Jung Chan-hyun, an official at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety’s disaster response division, which oversees the app. “We could not afford a time-consuming security check on the app that would delay its deployment.” Here are other developments from around the world: As the dust settled on days of rancorous negotiations, the compromises that allowed Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country holds the European Union’s rotating presidency, to guide 27 nations toward consensus on a landmark spending package were all the more apparent, and none too pretty, wrote Steven Erlanger and Matina Stevis-Gridneff in an analysis for The New York Times. Hong Kong will require travelers from the United States and Kazakhstan to show proof that they have tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of boarding a flight to the city. The government had already introduced this regulation for travelers from seven other countries it deemed high-risk, including Bangladesh, India, South Africa and the Philippines. Nearly 900,000 public workers in Britain, including teachers, doctors and security forces, will receive raises in recognition of the “vital contribution” they have made, Britain’s finance ministry announced Tuesday. Chinese officials are hailing a visit by a team of experts sent to Beijing by the World Health Organization to investigate the source of the coronavirus as evidence that the country is a responsible and transparent global power. But the investigation by the W.H.O. is likely to take many months and could face delays. Air passengers to China must provide a negative test result before boarding the flight, the aviation authority said. The test must be completed within five days of the trip. After four months of lockdown, Nepal is lifting most restrictions and will soon open schools, restaurants, international flights and mountain trekking. The government said the number of new coronavirus infections was decreasing, from a daily high of 700 a few weeks ago to 150 now or lower. The country of 30 million people has reported 17,994 infections and 40 deaths.  A former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday called on state health officials to start reporting coronavirus data in a detailed and uniform fashion, rather than the hodgepodge most states now produce. “We have a real vacuum of leadership at the national level,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former C.D.C. director, who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit health advocacy initiative. “Absent a national strategy, our best hope is to get all 50 states on the same page, so we know where we are.” Other public health experts said that such guidelines were long overdue and that the C.D.C.’s current director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, should have mandated them months ago. Dr. Irwin E. Redlener, founding director of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness, said it was “pathetic” that a private organization had to propose data standards and recruit states to voluntarily agree. “The feds should have been demanding exactly this kind of standardized information from every state and territory since March,” he said. “This is another illustration of the failures of the federal government — Trump was explicit in telling governors that they were on their own.” Dr. Frieden’s organization, concluding that states are reporting only 40 percent of the data needed to fight the pandemic, laid out 15 indicators that every state should report daily on a public “dashboard” that anyone can view. They include not just basic elements like cases, hospitalizations and deaths, but sophisticated metrics. Among them: what percentage of infections came from clusters of people who knew one another; how many health care workers are infected on the job; how long it takes to get a diagnostic test result; and what percentage ofresidents are wearing masks. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who helped design the data dashboard used by New York State and cited by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo during his news conferences, said Dr. Frieden’s proposal was “something we need in our tool kit that’s been absent.” As the virus surges around the world, government officials and business owners are increasingly turning to mask requirements to try to slow the spread of infection. Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami said Tuesday that the city would assign 39 police officers to a new unit that enforces mask violations. “All they will do for the whole week is mask enforcement,” he said. Austria announced on Tuesday a new mask mandate to go into effect on Friday for supermarkets and other stores that sell food, as well as post offices, banks and houses of worship. Cases in the alpine nation have begun rising again since restrictions were eased. On Tuesday, Austria recorded 1,386 active cases — roughly the same number as in mid-March, when the country was placed on lockdown. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said the police would arrest people for not wearing masks in public. “We have to ask our police to be more strict,” he said. “Catch them. A little shame, or put them on notice forever.” Southeastern Grocers, the owner of the Winn-Dixie chain of supermarkets, joined the growing list of retailers that are requiring customers to wear masks. The announcement late Monday came a day after a company spokesman defended the company’s earlier policy of not requiring them. The new policy will go into effect on July 27. Another large grocery chain in the region, Publix, started to require masks on Tuesday.

Russian Historian Who Found Stalin-Era Graves Is Convicted,2020-07-22,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — A Russian amateur historian who spent decades unearthing the graves of Stalin’s victims was found guilty on Wednesday of sexually assaulting his adopted daughter, charges that rights groups, his family and friends have dismissed as blatantly fabricated for political reasons. The conviction of the historian, Yuri A. Dmitriev, by a court in the northwestern region of Karelia ended a long campaign by the authorities to silence a scholar and rights activist whose work had challenged the Kremlin’s glorification of Russia’s past, including the Soviet era. Some of Mr. Dmitriev’s supporters drew comfort from the fact that the court, despite handing down a guilty verdict for sexual violence against a minor, sentenced the historian to just three and a half years in jail, far less than the 15-year sentence requested by prosecutors and less than the prison term required by law for the crime he was convicted of. He was found not guilty of illegal arms possession and of exploitation of children for the production of pornography. Because of the long period of time Mr. Dmitriev has been held in pretrial detention, he should be released by the end of the year. Anatoly Razumov, the director of the Center for Recovered Names in St. Petersburg and co-author of a book with Mr. Dmitriev that listed the names of thousands of people killed by Stalin’s secret police in Karelia, said he had been “ready for anything” during the trial, but was happy Mr. Dmitriev would soon be released. “The struggle goes on but getting him home soon is a small victory,” he said. The human rights group Memorial, whose Karelia branch Mr. Dmitriev headed, found little to celebrate, noting that the sentence, while milder than it could have been, “is not fair,” and denounced the whole trial. “The absolute groundlessness of the accusations was obvious from the start,” the group said in a statement. “Such a verdict on such a grave charge means one thing: The prosecution has no evidence of Dmitriev’s real guilt in violent acts of a sexual nature toward his underage adopted daughter.” Alexei Lidov, a prominent Moscow art historian, described the decision as a “nauseating” effort to avoid acknowledging that the case was bogus while sparing the target of security service fabrications from a lengthy period of jail time. “The wolves have been fed,” he said in a Facebook post, “The honor of a uniform is more important than the truth and the man.” The Russian authorities have frequently used accusations of pedophilia to demonize their critics, apparently calculating that sexual violence against minors is so offensive that nobody would speak up for the accused. Mr. Dmitriev’s case, however, attracted widespread condemnation as an example of Russia’s highly politicized justice system, with scores of respected Russian scholars, writers, artists and historians rallying to his defense. Human Rights Watch last month dismissed the charges against Mr. Dmitriev as “spurious.” The European Union also weighed in, demanding in April that the historian be released and the charges against him be dropped. His defenders believe that the case was driven mostly by politics, particularly a desire by the authorities to defend historical narratives promoted by President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin has made the celebration of Russian history, particularly the country’s role in the defeat of Nazi Germany, the bedrock of a state ideology in which Russia is always a victim of crimes committed by foreigners and almost never a perpetrator of crimes against its own people or other nations. Commenting on Russia’s history in a recent interview on state television, Mr. Putin said: “We have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.” But Mr. Dmitriev complicated the government’s narrative when he dug up the bones of hundreds of Stalin’s victims at Sandarmokh, a remote forest in Karelia, and documented the crimes of the Soviet state during the Great Terror of the 1930s. Since his arrest, a historical research group funded by the Kremlin has sought to undermine his work by digging up what it says are the bones of Russian soldiers killed at Sandarmokh by Finnish troops during World War II. Mr. Dmitriev was first arrested in 2016, initially on child pornography charges, and later acquitted by a Karelia court, only to have prosecutors launch a new case against him in 2018 on the more serious charges of sexual violence against a minor. Prosecutors later added additional charges relating to firearms. The judgment, handed down on Wednesday by the municipal court in Petrozavodsk, the capital of Karelia, is the latest in a series of court decisions in recent weeks that have targeted journalists and others caught up in a rolling crackdown on dissent at a time of growing economic hardship because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Putin’s approval rating has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years but a national plebiscite early this month on constitutional changes opened the way for him to remain as president until 2036. Under the terms of the old Constitution, he was supposed to step down at the end of his current term in 2024. Mr. Putin has increasingly turned to history to rally public support, pushing ahead, despite the coronavirus pandemic, with a huge military parade in Red Square last month to mark the 75th anniversary of the Red Army’s defeat of Nazi Germany. The view that the burial ground at Sandarmokh contains victims of Finland during the war, as well as of Stalin’s secret police, has found little support among serious historians, but has won wide favor with Russian nationalists who blame foreigners for all of Russia’s problems. The Military Historical Society, an organization set up by a Kremlin decree in 2012, has been particularly active in undermining Mr. Dmitriev’s work and promoting a guilt-free version of Russia’s past. Mr. Dmitriev was first arrested after investigators raided his home and found naked pictures of his adopted youngest daughter, Natalia, on his computer. A court in the Karelia region capital, Petrozavodsk, cleared him of these charges in 2018 after hearing testimony that the pictures of his daughter had been taken simply to monitor the medical condition of the girl who, at the time of her adoption, was malnourished and had severe developmental problems. Citing unspecified “new circumstances,” Karelia’s highest court in 2018 voided the acquittal and ordered a retrial on more serious charges of sexual assault against a minor. The head of a local museum who had assisted Mr. Dmitriev at Sandarmokh was also arrested and charged with pedophilia. He died in prison earlier this year. The Kremlin does not deny Stalin’s crimes and Moscow now has a large museum dedicated to the Gulag, a network of prison camps run by the dictator’s secret police. But Mr. Putin has put such intense focus on celebrating Russia’s victory against Nazi Germany in 1945 that efforts by people like Mr. Dmitriev to commemorate less glorious episodes of the past are often viewed with mistrust or outright hostility by the Kremlin’s vast propaganda apparatus and Kremlin-endorsed historians. Oleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.']",Yuri A. Dmitriev was sentenced to three and a half years in jail in a sex-crimes case that his supporters say is an effort to silence him for work that questioned the Kremlin’s glorification of Russia’s past.
Video Surfaces of Execution of Aid Workers and Others Abducted in Nigeria,2020-07-23,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — A Nigerian terrorist group has executed five men — three of them aid workers — who disappeared while providing assistance in the northeastern state of Borno last month. A video surfaced on Wednesday showing the men kneeling and blindfolded. They were then shot. The West African country of Nigeria has endured more than 10 years of abductions, killings and other abuses by armed Islamist groups, but regional governments have recently cracked down on insurgents, claiming to have killed thousands.  A group allied with the Islamic State, Islamic State West Africa Province, or I.S.W.A.P., is thought to be behind the executions of the five men, all Nigerians. The men had been traveling between Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, the Nigerian region hardest hit by terrorist attacks, and the town of Monguno when they were kidnapped. Local news outlets reported that they were aid workers with Action Against Hunger and the International Rescue Committee. One worked for Nigeria’s State Emergency Management Agency. Terrorist groups in northeastern Nigeria are often known by the catchall name Boko Haram, the nickname of the original group that took up arms in 2009, of which I.S.W.A.P. is a splinter group. Unlike the original Boko Haram, I.S.W.A.P. at first targeted mostly Christians, people affiliated with the state, and employees of international aid organizations. More recently, it has begun killing other Muslims too, some analysts have said. The group frequently abducts and executes aid workers after attempting to elicit ransoms. Over the past decade, northeastern Nigeria has been destabilized by armed men preaching radicalism who gained traction by airing grievances against the state. They pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, before splintering into several groups. Tens of thousands of civilians have since been killed, raped, abducted and tortured. President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to crush the terrorists and return peace to the northeast, but attacks have continued, and national forces have been accused of abuses that perpetuate the crisis. The insurgency was subdued somewhat in Mr. Buhari’s first term, analysts say, but has recently been bouncing back. The day before the execution video surfaced, Nigerian lawmakers, concerned about soldiers leaving the army in large numbers, asked the country’s security chiefs to step down, according to local media. The aid workers killed were Ishaku Yakubu, an employee of Action Against Hunger, Abdulrahman Dungus, who worked for an affiliate of France’s Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, and Luka Filibus, a child protection officer with the aid group International Rescue Committee.

"‘No One’ Protected British Democracy From Russia, U.K. Report Concludes",2020-07-21,By Mark Landler and Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — Russia has mounted a prolonged, sophisticated campaign to undermine Britain’s democracy and corrupt its politics, while successive British governments have looked the other way, according to a long-delayed report released on Tuesday by a British parliamentary committee. From meddling in elections and spreading disinformation to funneling dirty money and employing members of the House of Lords, the Russians have tried to co-opt politicians and corrode institutions, often with little resistance from law enforcement or intelligence agencies that ignored years of warning signs. The report, in many ways harder on British officials than the Russians, did not answer the question of whether Russia swayed one of the most consequential votes in modern British history: the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. But it was unforgiving about who is protecting British democracy. “No one is,” the report’s authors said. “The outrage isn’t if there is interference,” said Kevan Jones, a Labour Party member of Parliament who served on the intelligence committee that released the report. “The outrage is no one wanted to know if there was interference.” The release of the report came more than seven months after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party racked up an 80-seat majority in Parliament and almost 18 months after the end of the inquiry by the Intelligence and Security Committee, a parliamentary body that oversees the country’s spy agencies. Still, it was eagerly awaited in Britain, where anxieties about Russia’s behavior range from influence-peddling with oligarchs in London to the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence agent and his daughter in Salisbury, England. The report also landed in the heat of an American presidential election, shadowed by questions about ties between President Trump and Russia, as well as fears of renewed foreign tampering, not just by Russia, but also by China and Iran. The committee’s account characterized Russia as a reckless country bent on recapturing its status as a “great power,” primarily by destabilizing those in the West. “The security threat posed by Russia is difficult for the West to manage as, in our view and that of many others, it appears fundamentally nihilistic,” the authors said. Experts said the report showed parallels between Britain and the United States in the failure to pick up warning signs, but also important differences. The F.B.I. and other American agencies, they said, had investigated election interference more aggressively than their British counterparts, while the British were ahead of the United States in scrutinizing how Russian money had corrupted politics. “This is one of the pieces that is not really well understood in the U.S.,” said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which tracks Russian disinformation efforts in the United States. “Whether there is dirty Russian money that has flowed into our political system.” The report described how British politicians had welcomed oligarchs to London, allowing them to launder their illicit money through what it called the London “laundromat.” A growth industry of “enablers” — lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, and public relations consultants — sprang up to serve their needs. These people, the report said, “played a role, wittingly or unwittingly, in the extension of Russian influence which is often linked to promoting the nefarious interests of the Russian state.” Several members of the House of Lords, the report said, had business interests linked to Russia or worked for companies with Russian ties. It urged an investigation of them, though it did not name any names. That information, as well as the names of politicians who received donations, was redacted from the public report, along with other sensitive intelligence. “The most disturbing thing is the recognition of what the Russian government has gotten away, under our eyes,” said William F. Browder, an American-born British financier who has worked extensively in Russia and provided evidence to the committee. “The government, and particularly law enforcement, has been toothless.” The report painted a picture of years of Russian interference through disinformation spread by traditional media outlets, like the cable-TV channel RT, and by the use of internet bots and trolls. This activity dated back to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, but it was never confronted by the country’s political establishment or by an intelligence community with other priorities. Focused more on clandestine operations, the spy agencies were anxious to keep their distance from political campaigns, regarding them as a “hot potato,” the report said. Nor was it clear who in the government was in charge of countering the Russian threat to destabilize Britain’s political process. “It has been surprisingly difficult to establish who has responsibility for what,” the report said. Despite pressing questions, the report said the government had shown little interest in investigating whether the Brexit referendum was targeted by Russia. The government responded that it had “seen no evidence of successful interference in the E.U. referendum” and dismissed the need for further investigation. But the committee suggested that the reason no evidence had been uncovered was because nobody had looked for it. “In response to our request for written evidence at the outset of the inquiry, MI5 initially provided just six lines of text,” the committee said. Had the intelligence agencies conducted a threat assessment before the vote, it added, it was “inconceivable” that they would not have concluded there was a Russian threat. Among the report’s most politically salient conclusions might be about a Russian influence campaign during the Scottish independence referendum. Nationalist sentiment is surging again in Scotland, partly because many voters consider the Scottish authorities to have handled the coronavirus pandemic better than the government in England. Based on its previous behavior, some experts said, Russia would try again to encourage the fracturing of the United Kingdom. “That obviously has implications for next year’s Scottish elections, and the polling on referendums,” said Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, a research institute in London. “All this is very, very relevant.” Concerns about Russian meddling and aggression stretch back more than a decade to the death in 2006 of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer and critic of the Kremlin, who was killed in London using a radioactive poison, polonium-210, believed to have been administered in a cup of tea. An inquiry concluded that his killing “was probably approved” by President Vladimir V. Putin. In 2018, another former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury, after a poisoning attack that left them hospitalized for weeks. Britain accused two Russians of using a rare nerve agent to try to kill Mr. Skripal, and expelled 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation. Although the report was approved by Downing Street in 2019, its release was held up before the election that gave Mr. Johnson his decisive parliamentary majority. Critics said he had been compromised by donations to his party from wealthy Russians living in Britain and they argued that the report was delayed unnecessarily. After the election, there was a second delay while Downing Street agreed on the membership of a new Intelligence and Security Committee. While the publicly available part of the report unearthed little new material, one expert said that it underscored the need to widen the focus and improve the coordination of Britain’s intelligence apparatus. “We did know most of this,” said Martin Innes, director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University, “but people were not joining the dots and seeing that quite a serious situation was developing.” “What Russia wants is to be able to play great power politics,” Professor Innes said. “And one of the ways of doing that is by destabilizing the U.K. and some of its close allies to create that space to maneuver.”']","Russian efforts to interfere in the British political system were widely ignored by successive governments, according to a long-awaited report by Parliament."
Pompeo Praises Britain for Getting Tough on China,2020-07-21,By Benjamin Mueller,"['LONDON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday cheered the hardening British posture toward China and appealed for a global coalition against the country, blaming the Chinese Communist Party for what he described as exploitation of the coronavirus pandemic “to further its own interests.” Mr. Pompeo made the remarks on a visit to Britain, which in itself was something of a victory lap for the Trump administration. It had previously indicated that Britain had to choose whether to side with Beijing or Washington on matters like China’s role in telecommunications infrastructure. The secretary of state heaped praise on Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, for his government’s decision last week to ban equipment supplied by the Chinese technology giant Huawei from the country’s high-speed wireless network, among other things. “I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the British government for its principled responses to these challenges,” Mr. Pompeo said. “Well done.” The two men dismissed suspicions that Britain’s decisions had come at the behest of an American government locked in a widening confrontation with China. But analysts said that Mr. Pompeo’s embrace of his British counterparts would only make it more difficult for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to walk back from the brink of a deepening rift with Beijing. China’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, had lashed out at Britain on Monday night, accusing it of interfering in Chinese internal affairs and violating international law in its opposition to China’s crackdown on Hong Kong. Analysts said Mr. Pompeo’s remarks could further aggravate Britain’s worsening ties with China. “Pompeo’s sort of fulsome praise of how the British government has been working with the Americans is likely to make the Chinese response harder,” said Professor Steve Tsang, the director of the SOAS China Institute in London. “Now that may be what Pompeo wants to see. But that’s not what Dominic Raab or Boris Johnson want to see.” Professor Tsang said that Britain’s rebuff of Huawei had seemed calibrated not to provoke an outsized response from Beijing, since Mr. Johnson gave Huawei five months to continue selling equipment for Britain’s 5G networks before the ban takes effect. Mr. Johnson, a self-described “Sinophile,” has in the past praised efforts to take advantage of commercial opportunities through trade with China. “Johnson is trying to minimize the damages,” Professor Tsang said. But Mr. Johnson has been forced to change course in recent months as British public opinion, and the mood of his own Conservative Party, hardened in response to China’s crackdown on Hong Kong and its handling of the pandemic. Some Conservative lawmakers, among them the same politicians who once pushed a hard line on Britain’s exit from the European Union, have organized what they call the China Research Group, demanding that the government take a more aggressive approach to China for a number of reasons. Among them are China’s tough treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and fears that a United States-Britain trade deal — one of the desired outcomes of Brexit — would be jeopardized if Mr. Johnson spurned President Trump’s urgings for a more combative China policy. Mr. Pompeo met with some of those anti-China lawmakers from Britain’s Conservative Party on Tuesday. Among them was Iain Duncan Smith, a prominent Brexit supporter, who has lately called on the British government to ban TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform, arguing that it poses as much of a threat as Huawei. Mr. Pompeo has said the United States was looking at banning TikTok and other Chinese social media platforms. With tensions escalating between Western countries and China, Britain has taken a series of more aggressive steps in recent days. On Monday, it suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong to protest the new security law that tightened China’s grip on the former British colony and is seen by critics as jeopardizing long-cherished freedoms there. The suspension, ostensibly made in response to fears that anyone extradited to Hong Kong from Britain could be sent on to mainland China to face prosecution, was another indication that Western countries’ willingness to confront China has grown firmer since Beijing last month adopted the sweeping security law. For Mr. Pompeo, who has described China as the “central threat of our times,” the visit was an opportunity to solidify Britain’s support for a more confrontational approach to China. “It’s not about language, it’s not about words,” Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference with Mr. Raab on Tuesday. “We want every nation to work together to push back against the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts in every dimension that I described to you today.” He added, “That certainly includes the United Kingdom.” Within Britain, too, there are signs that the pressure on Mr. Johnson to continue his campaign against China will not abate. Anti-China lawmakers in Britain are said to be preparing to try to block efforts by a state-owned Chinese nuclear power company to expand its footprint in Britain.']",The secretary of state praised the British government for recent actions on China as the Trump administration tries to build a global coalition against Beijing.
"In Afghan Attacks, Facts Are Murky. But It’s Clear Deaths Are Piling Up.",2020-07-23,By Asadullah Timory and Mujib Mashal,"['HERAT, Afghanistan — For a full day after airstrikes on a remote village in western Afghanistan on Wednesday, the only certainty was that people had perished. The most basic facts — who had carried out the strikes, and how many Taliban and civilians were killed — were impossible to pin down amid the denials, conflicting statements and exaggerations. With the start of peace talks between the Taliban and the government delayed by months, the Afghan war has spiraled into a deadlier phase, even as the United States continues to withdraw its forces. Car bombs, roadside bombs and airstrikes wreak carnage across the country, killing dozens of Afghans everyday. But as the war has spread, the exact nature of the attacks and their toll, particularly on civilians, has increasingly grown opaque. The Taliban often flatly deny incidents that kill civilians, even when the bodies are there to be buried. Protest and pressure turns the government’s denials of civilian casualties in its operations into investigations that rarely result in follow-through or answers. The U.S. military, after a deal with the Taliban in February that was supposed to produce something resembling a cease-fire between them, has quietly returned to striking Taliban units that it sees as preparing attacks on its Afghan allies, but it no longer officially acknowledges those strikes. Making the battlefield still more murky has been the presence of other militant groups in addition to the Taliban, including factions with long ties to Al Qaeda as well as a branch of the Islamic State. The airstrikes on Wednesday in the Guzara district of Herat Province struck a group of 100 to 150 people who had gathered to welcome a Taliban member who had been held by the government, according to survivors, local officials and community leaders. He was released as part of a prisoner swap that is supposed to open the way for direct negotiations between the insurgents and the government. As part of the U.S. deal with the insurgents, the Afghan government was expected to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for 1,000 Afghan troops. But the government opposed the trade at first, and then only agreed to a phased release of captives after pressure from the Trump administration. Afghan officials say about 4,000 Taliban prisoners have been released so far — and some of them, they claim, have returned to the battlefield. The Taliban have released about 800 of the Afghan troops. As the prisoner swap dragged on for months, the Taliban cranked up its attacks across the country. Feeling pressure, the Afghan government announced it was going on the offensive, although its troops have been forced to largely defend against Taliban assaults. American aircraft, mostly drones and A-10 jets, have carried out at least 40 strikes on Taliban targets since the Feb. 29 agreement, a U.S. military official familiar with the operations said. But the Pentagon has not openly acknowledged most of its attacks, in an attempt to keep the already shaky peace process on track. In recent days, a bloody wave of violence has intensified. A Taliban roadside bomb killed seven members of the security forces, including senior local officials, in southern Uruzgan Province. In northern Baghlan Province, the Afghan air force struck two houses, an attack based on intelligence that Taliban fighters were staying there. Officials later found out that the insurgents had left and the strikes had killed five civilians, according to the district governor. In Kandahar Province, a Taliban infiltrator killed about a dozen police officers.  In Khogyani district in the east, the Afghan government said 31 Taliban were killed in one battle, which involved heavy air power. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan peace, condemned the Guzara airstrikes, saying that civilians were among the casualties. He also condemned the spate of recent Taliban attacks. “The last 24 hours have been very violent in Afghanistan with many losing their lives,” Mr. Khalilzad wrote on Twitter. “The Afghan people want an immediate start of peace negotiations and a settlement that is in their best interest. More graves will not bring negotiations forward.” But exactly what happened in Guzara, and how many people were killed, remained uncertain. Increasingly, it appeared the casualties were a mix of Taliban and civilians, as is often the case. Arbab Sarbeland, a local leader from the neighboring Adraskan district who was there for the ceremony, said helicopter gunships started hitting the area around 9 a.m. After the helicopters left, survivors loaded three dead and four wounded people into cars, but that turned out to be just the first of several attacks that day. It is not clear how many times the helicopters circled back to strike again, or if other aircraft were also involved. Noor Ahmad Khan, who was at the district center during the attack, said a relative he had dispatched to the village for information had told him the civilian toll stood at 12 dead and 22 wounded, but he would not comment on the number of Taliban casualties. Late on Wednesday, Abdul Salam Azimi, the police chief of Guzara district, said “about 50 Taliban are killed or wounded.” The Taliban, in a statement that said nothing about casualties to its fighters, said 8 civilians were killed in the strikes and 12 wounded. By the end of the day on Wednesday, it still wasn’t clear who had carried out the attack. American officials said it wasn’t the U.S. military. A spokesman for Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said it had “not carried out any airstrike in Herat,” and denied claims that one of the strikes had hit a vehicle carrying women and children. What damaged the vehicle, he said, was “actually a roadside bomb.” But around midnight, the Afghan defense ministry changed its position, admitting it had been behind the airstrikes and promising to investigate claims of civilian casualties. On Thursday, Asadullah Khalid, Afghanistan’s acting defense minister, said that he would show evidence that Afghan forces had struck Taliban fighters and that he was “hopeful there are no civilian casualties.” The Defense Ministry on Thursday afternoon released a 30-second video clip as evidence it had struck the Taliban. The clip, which lacked any time or date stamp, showed about a dozen armed men around vehicles and motorcycles. There was nothing in the video to show that they were, in fact, the same men who were killed and wounded on Wednesday. Assadullah Timory reported from Herat, and Mujib Mashal from Kabul. Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting from Washington and Fahim Abed from Kabul.']","With peace talks stalled, the details of intensifying strikes across the country, and their toll on civilians, are increasingly hard to pin down.

Australian Student Sues Government Over Financial Risks of Climate Change,2020-07-23,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Katta O’Donnell grew up with a fear of fire. As a child, she remembers burning bark falling from the air because of wildfires. This year, she worried that the blazes sweeping across regional Australia, fueled by climate change, could destroy her home outside Melbourne, the same way they had turned thousands of acres into ash. Now, Ms. O’Donnell, 23, is leading a class-action lawsuit filed on Wednesday that accuses the Australian government of failing to disclose the material risks of climate change to those investing in government bonds. The suit accuses the government and the treasury of breaching its duty by not disclosing the risks of global warming and their material impact on investors. It is the first time, experts say, that such a climate change case has been brought against a sovereign nation. Ms. O’Donnell is joining a wave of young climate activists who have stepped on to the world stage in recent years. The Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, for example, has spurred a global protest movement, testified before the United States Congress and the European Parliament, scolded world leaders in a fiery speech at the United Nations for not doing enough and sounded that alarm at the World Economic Forum in Davos, declaring, “Our house is still on fire.” But Ms. O’Donnell’s case takes a unique tack by focusing on government bonds and the investment environment, said Jacqueline Peel, a law professor at University of Melbourne. “My personal experience with climate change makes everything I read about climate change more tangible,” Ms. O’Donnell, a fifth-year law student at La Trobe University in Melbourne, said in a recent interview. “I want my government acting with honesty and telling the truth about climate risks.” Simply put: Any risks to the country’s economic growth, value of its currency or international relations, to name a few factors, might change the value of her investment, her suit states. Ms. O’Donnell, backed by a team including two prominent lawyers, is not asking for damages, but wants the government to step up on its climate change policies. The suit seeks an injunction stopping the government from further marketing bonds until they add those disclosures. “The claim asks for disclosure of risks — it doesn’t tell the government what to do or how to act,” said David Barnden, one of three lawyers representing Ms. O’Donnell. All took her case free, they said. But experts say that the case’s strategy is interesting given that the government has the power to legislate on climate change and control, in part, that risk. The Australian government has not publicly responded to the lawsuit. Reached for comment, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said in a statement that it did not comment on current court proceedings. Australia is physically vulnerable to climate change, which has helped drive drought, broken temperature records and led to the bleaching of the Great Barrier reef, so the financial risks of investing in the country have raised concerns. In 2019, Sweden’s central bank said it was letting go of Western Australian and Queensland government bonds in part because the greenhouse emissions from both were too high. In recent years, the country’s financial and corporate regulator have pressured financial institutions that issue bonds to disclose their plans to measure and mitigate the risks related to climate change.  “One of the major issuers of securities on the global financial markets is not leading from the front,” Rob Henderson, the former chief economist for National Australia Bank, said of the government’s lack of disclosure. Ms. O’Donnell’s case builds on an emerging trend of climate litigation, with calls for private companies to take responsibility for their part in the growing threat to the planet. A Peruvian man chose to sue Germany’s largest energy company because, he said, melting glaciers exacerbated by climate change are threatening his home. Other nations, including the Pacific island of Vanuatu, which are facing a threat to their very existences because of climate change, have said they are considering taking legal action against the world’s biggest fossil-fuel companies. In all, 1,587 climate litigation cases have been brought worldwide since 1986 and May this year, with Australia second only to the United States, according to the Grantham Institute of Research on Climate Change and the Environment. The cases have been filed “as a way of either advancing or delaying effective action on climate change,” the institute says. It is unclear if Ms. O’Donnell will be successful. But with many private corporations measuring — and promising to mitigate — their contributions to climate change, there is “strong acceptance of the simple argument that climate change poses material and financial risks,” said Anita Foerster, a senior lecturer in business law at Monash University. Ms. O’ Donnell, who bought her first government-issued bonds this year, says her interest in climate law and its effect on investors began when she heard Mr. Barnden, now her lawyer, speak at a lecture last year. She said she chose her legal strategy because she wanted to educate herself and others who bought such bonds of the potential financial risks of climate change. “All routes are crucial, and we will need to unite.” she said. “But investment and the economies and the climate are all so closely linked, and that really needs to be highlighted.” “The government knows about the problem,” she added. “They know the solutions, and they know what they need to do but they’re not doing it.” Mr. Henderson said he expected the case to prompt those in other nations to follow suit: “Other people will be saying, hang on what about our government?”']",A 23-year-old law student filed a class-action suit accusing Australia of failing to disclose financial risks from climate change. Experts say it is the first of its kind.
Saudi King Is Said to Have Successful Gallbladder Surgery,2020-07-23,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — King Salman of Saudi Arabia had surgery on Thursday to remove his gallbladder, days after being hospitalized, according to a statement from the royal court carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. The announcement of the 84-year-old king’s hospitalization had revived speculation about the state of his health. But the kingdom partly quieted the murmurs by releasing on Wednesday a photograph of him conducting a virtual cabinet session from the hospital. The cabinet meeting notwithstanding, the king does not oversee the government of Saudi Arabia on a day-to-day basis; the real power lies with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his son. Since being promoted to first in line for the throne in 2017, Prince Mohammed has upended the kingdom with a dizzyingly ambitious plan to remake its economy and wean it off oil revenues, as well as instituting a brash foreign policy, cracking down on critics and introducing a rapid series of social changes. Having forced out the previous crown prince in a dramatic power grab in 2017 and sidelined other royal rivals or perceived opponents, Prince Mohammed now stands as his father’s unquestioned successor. Yet the coronavirus pandemic has dealt a serious humbling to Saudi leadership. Oil prices plummeted as the pandemic paralyzed most of the world, severing the kingdom’s main source of revenue and forcing it to announce budget cuts and painful tax increases. Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed’s plan for overhauling the economy, will most likely face a pruning, analysts say. The government also had to restrict the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, to a small fraction of the millions of Muslims who usually travel to Saudi Arabia each year — a public health measure that deprived the kingdom of the prestige of hosting Islam’s most important pilgrimage and of the tourism revenue that it brings. As the outbreak ballooned, King Salman, whose official title names him custodian of the holy mosques at Mecca and Medina, secluded himself in an island palace on the Red Sea, near Jeddah. King Salman suffered from health issues since before he ascended to the throne in 2015, taking over after the death of his brother, Abdullah. Before becoming king, Salman had served as crown prince and defense minister, and before that, as governor of Riyadh for nearly 50 years, where he was known for managing the development of the capital. With a reputation as a disciplined administrator who took charge of misbehaving royal family members, King Salman was expected to keep the kingdom on the steady, predictable course it had taken under his predecessor, with no more than perhaps a few moderate changes. But that changed with the elevation of his favored son, Prince Mohammed.']","Days after King Salman was hospitalized, renewing rumors about his health, the royal court announced that the 84-year-old monarch had undergone an operation."
"For Palestinian Police, Much to Lose if Israel Annexes West Bank Land",2020-07-22,"By David M. Halbfinger, Adam Rasgon and Mohammed Najib","['JENIN, West Bank — What wounded Maj. Zahi Jamhour most, he said, wasn’t that the Palestinians he had sworn to protect threw stones at him. It wasn’t even the bullet shot through his leg by an Israeli soldier — a mistake, he was told later — after his Palestinian police squad had risked their lives to rescue a Jew from an attempted lynching. No, what stings to this day is how the Arab doctors and nurses at an East Jerusalem hospital reacted when he told them how he had been shot. “They laughed at me,” Major Jamhour, 50, recalled ruefully. “They said, ‘You deserved it.’” The scorn heaped upon Palestinian Authority security officers for cooperating with Israel, some officers say, was the bitter price of jobs with significant benefits: salaries, pensions and, for some, cars, training abroad and proximity to power. Neighbors called them collaborators, doing the dirty work for Israel’s occupation. Relatives questioned their self-respect. Israeli counterparts, they said, routinely treated them with highhandedness and disdain. And yet, in their colorful uniforms, the security forces are a conspicuous embodiment of the incipient state they hoped they were building. Now that Israel’s threat to annex parts of the West Bank has thrown that national project into doubt, many officers question whether the cost to them was worth it. “It’s as if you’re building a house, and you see the whole thing collapse,” said a senior intelligence officer in Jenin, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to be interviewed. In a rare series of interviews, Palestinian officers in the West Bank candidly described a law enforcement system that is already fraying, inviting violence and chaos. In protest of Israel’s planned annexation, the Palestinian Authority halted security cooperation with Israel, impairing police and intelligence work that benefited both sides. The authority also stopped accepting taxes collected on its behalf by Israel, and in the resulting budget crisis, most officers are receiving only partial pay; some are already skipping work. Many of those still reporting for duty sip coffee in their stations rather than responding to calls and risking detention by Israeli forces, leaving large areas without police protection. The security forces have long played a complicated role. They have become more professional in recent years, but remain an instrument of political control as well as security. Scarred by losing Gaza to Hamas in a 2007 civil war, the forces have been crucial in keeping Fatah in power in the West Bank, aggressively quashing more militant factions. They have tortured some of the authority’s critics, human rights groups say. Still, polls show that Palestinians trust the security forces more than the authority’s leaders. Buf if the dream of statehood is dashed, the officers who have risked their lives and reputations for it have much to lose. “You say, ‘State, state, state,’ and now the other side is saying ‘you won’t get one,’” said Akram Rajoub, a longtime commander in Preventive Security, a domestic intelligence agency, who is now the governor of Jenin. “Where have all these state-building efforts gone? Where has all this investment gone? What are we going to tell our children?” He was just a boy in the village of Al Qubeiba, Col. Saed Zahran said, when he first grasped how little Israelis cared about crime among Palestinians. Two children were killed. Israeli detectives arrived, scribbled a few notes and left. The crime remains unsolved. He said the memory inspired him to join the police force when it was established in the 1990s, believing that Palestinians had to rely on themselves for law and order. Yet even as commander of the Nablus police district, Colonel Zahran, 51, has only limited ability to deliver protection and justice. Security cooperation with Israel, Palestinians say, was not as mutual as the term suggests. The West Bank is ruled under Israeli military law. And while Israeli forces go anywhere at will, Palestinian forces needed permission to enter places where Israel has jurisdiction. When Israeli forces entered a Palestinian area, Palestinian officers were warned to clear out — to avoid potential friction or the embarrassment of being seen alongside the Israelis. Palestinian officers insist that they raced to comply with Israeli requests for assistance, while urgent Palestinian requests for help too often languished unanswered. “We often have disputes between families,” Colonel Zahran said, in which the police are called to intervene. But these frequently occur in places the police cannot go without Israeli approval. In a typical case last year, the police were called to defuse a violent dispute in the village of Haris, but waited hours for approval. Colonel Zahran said he gave up and drove there in civilian clothes, in an unmarked car, without his sidearm. Nowhere is the asymmetry more frustrating, he said, than when his officers refer cases to Israel for prosecution, only to see them dropped. Last August, an officer investigating the destruction of a shop in Azun Atma was run down by two Israelis accused of the crime. Video of the hit-and-run shows the officer thrown into the air. Colonel Zahran said he turned over “a complete file” to Israeli authorities, who arrested the two but released them days later without explanation. “What about the Palestinian police officer who was almost killed?” he said. In April, he said, an Israeli citizen was caught in Qalqilya with 700 grams of hashish. Under the Oslo Accords, Israeli citizens must be turned over to Israel. But the Israeli authorities set the man free after an hour, sparking outrage in Qalqilya — at Colonel Zahran and his men. “Honestly, how am I supposed to defend what we did?” he said. Israeli officials did not respond to Colonel Zahran’s specific accusations. But they acknowledge that West Bank cases are often dropped when the victims are Palestinian. Broadly speaking, they say, Israel prioritizes counterterrorism over crime-fighting. The Israeli police “prefer to deal with issues inside Israel,” and crimes involving Israeli victims, said Dov Sedaka, a former head of Israel’s civil administration of the West Bank. “The issue isn’t our ability to collect evidence. It’s how much effort do we want to put in?” All of which leaves officials like Colonel Zahran feeling pained and powerless. “Palestinian citizens feel I’m not able to protect them,” he said. While the police are ridiculed for their subservient relationship with Israeli authorities, Palestinians can at least see some benefit in law enforcement. Intelligence officers, by contrast, have long been viewed with suspicion for working with Israel in cracking down on groups like Hamas. Arrests of militants often trigger an avalanche of online vitriol aimed at the intelligence forces, said the senior officer in Jenin. “Every officer needs to have the conversation with his kids,” he said, to justify his work. “I’d tell them that we were all under occupation, that we were officers serving our people first, and that if we were not there, our people would suffer.” He said he assured his children that he was laying the groundwork for an eventual Palestinian state, which meant arresting militants who threatened to destabilize the West Bank. Yet that work can suffer because of the power imbalance with Israel. When he was conducting a major arrest operation in Jenin, he said, he discovered Israeli forces there, too. The Palestinians had to withdraw. “They say, ‘Our work is more important,’” he said. “Sometimes they don’t tell us they’re coming,” he added. “Sometimes they only tell us when they arrive.” Israeli officials say they prefer to cooperate, but their incursions are often prompted by the unwillingness of Palestinian intelligence to arrest militants aligned with Fatah. “It’s a fact that we have more power, but we’ve tried to not make that explicit,” said Nitzan Alon, a retired major general who commanded Israeli forces in the West Bank. With security coordination halted, Palestinian officers say they are holding their heads a bit higher. But the severing of ties sometimes forces them into dangerous workarounds. Having stopped seeking clearance to cross Israeli checkpoints, Palestinian officers are changing the plates on their cars, traveling in plainclothes and unarmed, and inventing cover stories about their destinations. In the town of Anata last month, unarmed officers who tried to arrest two people suspected of dealing drugs had to withdraw when a crowd gathered; they could not call in armed reinforcements. But the greatest risk, the intelligence officer said, is what is happening in areas where he needed Israel’s approval to operate and it is too dangerous to do so unarmed. Arms smuggling there was already widespread, he said, and now it is unchecked. “Those weapons will land in the hands of people who would destroy all that we’ve accomplished,” he added. Everyone in Palestinian security seems to have at least a story or two of his own abasement. For Col. Ahed Hasayen, a police spokesman in Ramallah, it came at a conference with the Israeli police in Jaffa. His Israeli counterpart asked to take a photograph with him. Colonel Hasayen demurred, but the Israeli insisted that it would only be a keepsake. His phone rang 90 minutes later, on the drive back to Bethlehem. “Shame on you,” he said a friend told him. The photo was circulating on social media. “After that, how can you trust them again?” Colonel Hasayen said. “Hamas said I should’ve worn a suicide belt.” For Major Jamhour, it was the night of Feb. 2, 2018, when a call came from headquarters: An Israeli motorist had made a wrong turn into the town of Abu Dis. An angry crowd had trapped him. Major Jamhour and his men arrived in minutes. They surrounded the Israeli’s Toyota and a trailer it was pulling, plastered with Israeli flags, as young Palestinians pelted it with stones. One officer was struck in the forehead. When someone threw a firebomb into the Toyota, Major Jamhour said, the officers hustled the Israeli into their own vehicle and the wounded officer climbed on top of him, shielding him with his body. The crowd grew to around 200 people, yelling, “Give us this man!” Major Jamhour said. The Palestinian officers kept them at bay for two hours before Israeli soldiers and border police arrived. Major Jamhour said he approached them with his hands up, announcing himself as a policeman in Hebrew, Arabic and English. “I told them, ‘Your man is safe,’” he said, and led the soldiers to the motorist. But before the Israelis pulled out, Major Jamhour said, one of his men shouted at him to look out: An Israeli was aiming a rifle at him. “I said, ‘Impossible,’” Major Jamhour said — right before a bullet ripped through his leg. “They didn’t shoot the stone throwers,” he said. “They shot me, in a police uniform.” The Israeli army confirmed that a soldier had shot Major Jamhour, chalking it up to confusion. His family begged him to quit the police. He refused, but his attitude had changed. Until that night, he said, he never hesitated to step in to protect vulnerable civilians — Jew and Arab alike. But he no longer feels obligated to act courageously in defense of Israelis. “I went through coordination and they shot me,” he said. “Now, there’s no coordination. I will not go to die.”']","Palestinian security officers, scorned for working with Israel, say they are on the front lines of building a state. But what if the state-building project fizzles?"
Demolition of Historic Vietnam Cathedral Is Underway,2020-07-22,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — The historic Bui Chu Cathedral in Vietnam, a 135-year-old church considered by many an architectural gem, is being demolished to make room for a bigger cathedral despite last-ditch efforts to save it. By Wednesday, workers had removed tiles from the floor and dismantled much of the roof of the cathedral, which is in Nam Dinh Province, about two hours south of Hanoi. A high fence has been erected around the building, and demolition will most likely be completed by early next month. “This would amount to an irremediable loss of heritage for Vietnam, for the world, and for the Catholic Church itself,” said Martin Rama, a top economist with the World Bank who has worked to save the building. “Indeed, the ancient Bui Chu Cathedral embodies an amazing intersection of culture, history, and architecture.” As Vietnam’s population and economy have grown in recent decades, the country has lost much of its cultural heritage with the destruction — or aggressive renovation — of numerous French colonial buildings, pagodas and temples. The Communist government declined last year to declare Bui Chu a heritage site, which would have prevented its demolition. Nor has it intervened in plans to build a new cathedral. In many parts of Vietnam, the Roman Catholic Church has been a leader in historic preservation, making the cathedral’s demolition unusual.  “You would rate the church as one of the most successful defenders of heritage around the country,” said Mark Bowyer, a longtime Vietnam resident and travel blogger who visited Bui Chu last year for his website, Rusty Compass. “In this case, the church is committing an act of self-harm.” Bui Chu’s priests have said that the old structure must be razed because it is in dangerous condition. The electrical wiring is faulty and could start a fire, they say, and plaster occasionally falls from the high ceiling, endangering parishioners. They say the new cathedral will be a replica of the old one but could hold more people. Mr. Rama, who served for eight years as the World Bank’s lead economist in Vietnam, has long taken an interest in Bui Chu and came up with a plan this year to save it. Acting in a personal capacity, he met with church leaders and proposed acquiring land next to the church’s property, which would expand the church’s holdings and provide room for both buildings. Mr. Rama, now based in Washington as the World Bank’s chief economist for Latin America and the Caribbean, offered to pay for the land himself and to start a global fund-raising campaign to raise the estimated $3 million to restore the old cathedral. “Saving the ancient Bui Chu Cathedral in a way that allows building the new church and welcoming large numbers of parishioners is entirely feasible,” said Mr. Rama, who also is project director of a sustainable urban development center with the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences. “Future generations will be forever grateful to the fathers if they make an enlightened decision.” To his disappointment, church leaders rejected his offer in favor of their original plan to build a new cathedral in place of the old one. The cathedral’s bishop, Thomas Vu Dinh Hieu, declined Wednesday to discuss his rejection of Mr. Rama’s offer or comment on Bui Chu’s demolition, saying only, “We do not want to talk with the media.” A local official in Xuan Ngoc, the site of the church, said the priests had permission to proceed with the demolition. He refused to give his name and declined to comment further. Among the hundreds of Catholic churches in Vietnam, Bui Chu stands out because of its unusual blend of Baroque and Vietnamese architecture. The Bui Chu diocese is where Catholicism first took hold in Vietnam more than 400 years ago, long before French or Communist rule. The area draws few tourists but remains the heartland of Catholic Vietnam today. “Bui Chu church is the birthplace of Vietnamese Catholicism,” said Nguyen Hanh Nguyen, an associate professor at the University of Architecture in Ho Chi Minh City. “It should be recognized as a heritage site and preserved in its original state.” While the Communist government officially opposes organized religion, it has reached a state of détente with religious leaders, allowing them to hold services and to keep and maintain their facilities. The reticence of Bui Chu’s priests to speak to the media is not surprising. When they sought to raze the cathedral last year, they were stung by public criticism and their plans were eventually derailed. A group of 25 architects petitioned the prime minister and other government officials in May 2019 to declare the cathedral a heritage site and block the demolition. They said the cathedral’s blend of European and Vietnamese elements, details and materials, created a singular architectural work found nowhere else in Vietnam. Around that time, a raging fire destroyed the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, devastating Catholics around the world and prompting many Vietnamese to oppose razing Bui Chu. Although Vietnam’s government did not intervene, the priests backed off. On inspecting Bui Chu at the time, the architects found that it was only slightly damaged and was in good enough condition to last a long time if reinforced. Photographs of the church as it is being demolished have only bolstered that view, said Ms. Nguyen, who was one of the 25 architects. “Based on the image of the recent dismantlement,” she said, “the wooden structure of the church is still in good condition, not a serious degradation.” Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi.']",The 135-year-old Bui Chu Cathedral will be replaced with a replica that can hold more people.

"Angela Merkel Guides the E.U. to a Deal, However Imperfect",2020-07-21,By Steven Erlanger and Matina Stevis-Gridneff,"[' BRUSSELS — After days and nights of rancorous haggling, European Union leaders reached an $857 billion pandemic recovery plan on Tuesday that, for the first time, committed them to borrow money collectively and distribute much of it as grants that do not need to be repaid by the countries hardest hit by the virus, like Italy. But as the dust settled after the marathon negotiations — the European Union’s longest summit meeting in 20 years — the compromises that allowed Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country holds the E.U.’s rotating presidency, to guide 27 nations toward consensus became all the more apparent, and none were too pretty. The fissures in the bloc that Ms. Merkel needed to bridge ran up, down and sideways. There were divides between the frugal north and a needy, hard-hit south; but also west to east, between Brussels and budding autocracies like Poland and Hungary that have tested the limits of the bloc’s liberal democratic values. But allowing the crisis stirred by the pandemic to worsen was in the end considered more dangerous than trimming some of the bloc’s larger budgetary ambitions or even allowing continued challenges to the rule of law. The compromise that got most attention was between President Emmanuel Macron of France, who pushed for large-scale grants to southern European countries like Italy and Spain hit hardest by the pandemic, and Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, who pressed for more loans than grants and for structural economic reforms in return. But how Ms. Merkel mollified the prime ministers of Hungary and Poland, Viktor Orban and Mateusz Morawiecki, may prove  more consequential. Not only was their money from Brussels protected and increased, despite regular questions about the misuse of those funds and efforts to condition the aid on adherence to the rule of law, but she promised to help them conclude bloc disciplinary measures against them for their alleged anti-democratic abuses. “Prime Minister Orban told me he wants to take the necessary steps and does not want this to hang in the air,’’ Ms. Merkel said early Tuesday about the disciplinary procedure that had been opened against Hungary. “We will support Hungary,’’ she said, “but of course the crucial steps will need to be taken by Hungary.’’ That concession, little remarked upon, may have sealed the agreement, even if it outrages critics who think that Brussels is showing weakness in the face of abuses of bloc laws and values by some Central European member states. And that aspect of the deal may end up being the most contentious in the European Parliament, which must approve it. The agreement “looks like a disaster for the rule of law,’’ said R. Daniel Kelemen, a scholar of Europe at Rutgers University. “Merkel and Macron were determined to reach a deal demonstrating the E.U.’s ability to respond to the crisis, and they proved willing to keep E.U. funds flowing to autocratic governments in order to close the deal.’’ Still, by tying the recovery fund into the seven-year budget, the first without Britain, they managed to solve two extremely difficult and tendentious problems at once. For all its messiness, there was little doubt that what they had achieved for the bloc was groundbreaking. Ms. Merkel understood that failure would badly undermine the new leaders of the European Union itself — Council President Charles Michel and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, a former member of Ms. Merkel’s government. Having joined with Mr. Macron in supporting a virus recovery fund borrowed for collectively — a first — she then patiently worked for consensus, understanding the political needs of both Mr. Macron, whose expansive vision for the E.U. remains unfulfilled, and of Mr. Rutte, whose government hangs by a thread, depending on politicians even more tightfisted than he. Mr. Macron and Mr. Rutte proved themselves two sometimes angry, sometimes emotional leaders of the two main contending groups, and the weekend talks were unusually acrimonious. With Britain gone, Mr. Rutte and his Austrian counterpart, Sebastian Kurz, have stepped forward to create a bloc of smaller countries, known as “the frugals,’’ which are trying to restrain the big-spending, integrationist ambitions of Mr. Macron and the poorer southern countries. But while they came to Brussels saying that they were opposed to any outright grants based on collective debt, it was obvious that there would be some once France and Germany pushed for them. Then the only question — however difficult — was to negotiate an amount and some mechanism to monitor the spending, so that everyone could go home talking of victory. France and Germany had proposed 500 billion euros in grants; the Commission took that and added another 250 billion in loans; in the end, after intense squabbling, the balance was 390 billion in grants and 360 billion in loans. Still, that is a remarkable victory for Mr. Macron, who has broken a major taboo on creating collective debt and built a possible architecture for handling future crises — if Ms. Merkel’s successors agree. For the future of the euro currency, the elephant in the room is Italy, the bloc’s third-largest economy by most measures, and already drowning in debt. Italy is both one of the least reformed economies in the eurozone and one of the hardest hit by the virus. So while both groups agreed that Italy must be a major beneficiary of funds that do not increase its already sizable debt pile, Mr. Rutte and his group — including Austria, Sweden, Denmark and often Finland — also wanted tough monitoring on the use of those funds. And they wanted member states to have a say in that monitoring, not just the Commission, the bloc’s unelected bureaucracy, which they regard as weak and often blind to abuses. That could create significant bitterness for the future. But for now, bending to reality, the “frugals’’ in return got the numbers down, got some form of state monitoring and got paid off with higher rebates in the budget. “Despite all this progress, we should not delude ourselves,’’ said Friedrich Heinemann, research department head at ZEW Mannheim, the Center for European Economic Research. “The lack of competitiveness and low growth prospects in countries like Italy cannot be solved with transfers and loans from Brussels. Only comprehensive reforms of labor markets, public administration and the education and innovation system will help.” Others were angered by the concessions to Mr. Orban, in particular, which may plant the seeds for future conflict. “Planned sanctions for E.U. member states that violate fundamental rights and the rule of law have been watered down beyond recognition,’’ said Daniel Freund, a German European legislator from the Greens. By now requiring a reinforced majority to impose sanctions, “the whole mechanism is rendered useless.’’ Ms. Merkel clearly decided she needed the fund more and “has always been lenient on Orban,’’ he said. The result, he said, puts leaders “on a collision course with the European Parliament and makes a quick agreement unlikely.’’ Not least, to reach consensus, the E.U. ended up with a smaller post-Brexit European budget, and one that eliminates or reduces spending for some ambitious projects designed to prepare Europe for the future — like in research and climate transition, a fund to promote consensus on carbon goals for 2030 that was slashed by one-third. Even with the virus, a proposed health fund evaporated entirely. There were also reductions from Commission proposals in other areas of investment, foreign policy and defense. Ms. von der Leyen called it “a difficult point” and said that such cuts, made in the search for a compromise, are “regrettable, it decreases the innovative part of the budget.’’ “It was all about give and take, so the victims seem to have been the E.U. public goods, which deliver value added to all,’’ said Jean Pisani-Ferry, a French economist, in a Twitter message. “The price of the deal looks high.” “This is not frugal. This is stupid,’’ said Henrik Enderlein, a German economist who heads of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, in a Twitter response. But he also applauded the larger deal and the recovery fund. “We shouldn’t be frugal in our judgment,’’ he said. “This is historic.” As Mr. Enderlein noted, the summit must be considered a breakthrough in a time of crisis when the European Union, now without Britain, could not be seen to fail. European fights about money and budgets are never pretty. But Ms. Merkel more than most understands that for all the talk of European solidarity, the European Union only proceeds when its varied leaders can convince their voters that they have fought the good fight for national interests. As Janis Emmanouilidis, director of Studies at the European Policy Centre, commented: “The price of no deal would have been much higher — potentially incalculable both economically and politically at the E.U. and national level.’’ But however important, this deal cannot be the last, he suggested, noting: “We are still at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.’’']","With her long experience as German chancellor, she shapes a necessary compromise on virus aid for the battered European south.

Scandal and Infighting Erupt Within India’s Ailing Congress Party,2020-07-23,By Kai Schultz and Suhasini Raj,"['JAIPUR, India — As the once-formidable Indian National Congress party began to crumble in recent years, Sachin Pilot, a young, well-connected politician, stepped up to help his bloc weather one crisis after another. Mr. Pilot’s parents were Congress stalwarts and served in elite government positions. He is close with members of the Gandhi family, who have controlled the party for decades, dominating India’s electorate until Prime Minister Narendra Modi first swept into office six years ago on a wave of Hindu nationalism. Many thought Mr. Pilot, 42, who represented Congress as deputy chief minister in the northern state of Rajasthan, had the perfect résumé to lead the party to a rebirth. Instead, India’s political establishment has been jolted by accusations this month that Mr. Pilot was secretly working on behalf of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, possibly in an effort to depose a chief minister he had fallen out with. Mr. Pilot has denied those accusations. Congress loyalists fear the scandal is another severe blow to the survival of the party, which led the country to independence more than 70 years ago but has been cracking internally under the weight of huge Bharatiya Janata Party victories led by Mr. Modi. Party officials in Rajasthan immediately called for dozens of Congress politicians to move into a hotel in a desperate effort to keep them from defecting. As the country’s political discourse has been dominated by nationalism and Hindu-centric policies, many also worry that the weakness of Congress, which traditionally has championed minorities, harms India’s democracy more broadly. The scandal broke out in recent days when party officials accused Mr. Pilot of offering multimillion-dollar bribes to fellow Congress leaders and urging them to defect to the Bharatiya Janata Party over a period of several months. The fallout was swift and unforgiving. Party leadership removed Mr. Pilot from his post and accused 18 other politicians of colluding with him. Ashok Gehlot, the chief minister in Rajasthan, called his deputy a “worthless person” and released audiotapes that he said implicated Mr. Pilot in a conspiracy to buy off officials “like goats in a market.” “Speaking good English, giving good quotes and being handsome isn’t everything,” Mr. Gehlot told reporters. Mr. Pilot, who did not respond to requests from The New York Times for comment, maintained his innocence in an interview with India Today, insisting that he had no intention of joining the Bharatiya Janata Party. He accused Mr. Gehlot of trying to “humiliate me” and block him from a bigger role in the Congress party. It was one of the most public expressions yet of resentment within Congress that the party is failing to make room for a younger group of leaders to emerge. The upshot is that Mr. Modi’s party is stronger than ever.Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University, said Congress has failed to give incentives to officials to stick with the party, leading some to “seek greener pastures.” In recent years, dozens of senior Congress leaders have left the party, fed up with a lack of visionary leadership. Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. has seized on the turmoil, steadily undermining Congress in the few states that it still controls. In Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, another Congress star who was close to the Gandhis and came from a long line of princes, defected to the B.J.P. in March, causing Congress to lose its fragile hold on the state government. In an interview, Satish Poonia, the president of the B.J.P. in Rajasthan, said “all of the allegations against us are false.” Instead, he described the conflict as a bitter generational rift between Mr. Pilot and older Congress leaders like Mr. Gehlot, 69 — a view also shared by many within Congress.  India has a long history of power grabs and high-level defections, and local news outlets have published accounts from unnamed B.J.P. officials in Rajasthan describing a political coup attempt gone awry, with a disgruntled Mr. Pilot at its center. Rajasthan is a large, politically competitive state, and home to some of India’s vital heritage and cultural sites. Congress controls 107 seats in the state legislature, barely enough to form a majority government. Just a few crossovers would shift the balance of power to the B.J.P. Congress leaders in Rajasthan are deeply rattled. Last week, Mr. Gehlot’s government moved more than 100 elected officials into the Fairmont Hotel, a five-star resort in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, hoping to prevent them from leaving for the B.J.P. The fear was that if the lawmakers remained at home, it would be easier to bribe or entice them to defect. On a recent day this week, riot buses and police officers dressed in camouflage blocked the resort’s entrance. Inside, politicians attended yoga classes and watched Bollywood movies in a marble-floored lobby. Rafeek Khan, a member of Rajasthan’s Legislative Assembly who is among those staying at the hotel, said he had no idea when they would be allowed to leave. “The B.J.P. is playing with democracy,” he said. “They think one can be bought if enough money is offered. That is the message the B.J.P. is sending to the electorate.” In the coming days, Rajasthan’s legislature is expected to decide whether Mr. Pilot and the 18 other rebel officials will lose their seats, which would make forming a new government under the B.J.P. much tougher. The decline of Congress accelerated last year, when Rahul Gandhi, the great-grandson of India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, resigned from his post as president after a humiliating general election defeat against Mr. Modi. Many Indians see the Congress party as a protector of the nation’s founding secular values, but far too beholden to the Gandhis, who are often perceived as a symbol of India’s Anglicized upper class. Mr. Gandhi, his mother, Sonia, who assumed the role of interim president, and his sister, Priyanka, all still call the party’s shots. Mr. Modi continually hammers Congress for being a family dynasty, and his party’s embrace of a brawny Hindu nationalism that emphasizes India’s Hindu heritage has tracked well with voters. Rasheed Kidwai, a former journalist who wrote a book about Sonia Gandhi, said Congress simply could not compete. “They are going through the motions,” he said. “They are very demoralized. They don’t have any hope.” Analysts say trouble has been brewing for Congress in Rajasthan since 2018, when the party scored a victory over the B.J.P. in state elections and retook control of the state government after five years in the opposition. In his interview with India Today, Mr. Pilot said he proposed himself as chief minister, citing his role in helping secure that win. But he ultimately relented to an agreement to take the second spot behind Mr. Gehlot under the impression that he would soon be elevated. Mr. Pilot, whose name comes from the fact that his father was a decorated combat pilot, apparently felt sidelined by Mr. Gehlot, and bitterness between the men grew. “This was a badly handled show and one more state could slip out of Congress’ hands,” said Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in New Delhi. “It is a failure of national leadership.” Hari Kumar and Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from New Delhi.']","Sachin Pilot, a prominent Congress politician, has been sidelined after being accused of bribing members to defect to Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party."
Five Takeaways From the Report on Russia’s Interference in Britain,2020-07-21,By Stephen Castle,"['LONDON — A long-awaited report into Russian influence in Britain was finally published on Tuesday, painting a damning picture of the failure of successive British governments to combat a series of threats and interference in its affairs, ranging from disinformation to the purchase of influence. The British took their eye off the ball and are still playing catch up, the report revealed, concluding that Britain was one of Moscow’s top intelligence targets amid growing diplomatic tensions between the two nations. As Kevan Jones, a member of Parliament who served on the intelligence committee that released the report, said on Tuesday, Russian interference in Britain “is the new normal,” and a major overhaul is needed to counter Moscow’s destabilization efforts in the future. Here are some of the main takeaways of the report. According to the report, intelligence agencies ignored threats from Russian interference that they should have seen coming. No one agency seems to have been responsible for protecting Britain’s democratic process during a series of high profile votes and the report said that it was “surprisingly difficult to establish who has responsibility for” that. Much of the Russian interference took place in the open — occurring through disinformation — and that meant that it was not the top focus of spy agencies and was partly the responsibility of other government officials. The intelligence community avoided it because it did not want to get involved in domestic politics. They regarded questions about Russian influence in the Brexit referendum as a “hot potato.” But in hanging back, they may have made life easier for Moscow. The report did not show that Russia meddled to any significant extent in the 2016 Brexit vote that prompted Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union — nor did Russia influence the final outcome. But it suggests that no one in the British government ever really asked the question while the campaign was underway — or even after it — despite evidence of meddling. It notes that open source studies pointed to Russia’s use of bots and trolls to misinform, as well as pro-Brexit and anti-European Union articles on Russian foreign language media outlets. But when the intelligence committee requested information from the domestic intelligence service, MI5, about Russian interference in the referendum, M15 had little to offer. Its initial response was just six lines of text. Two years before the Brexit vote, Scotland held a referendum in which it opted to remain part of the United Kingdom. According to the report there was “credible open source commentary” suggesting that Russia attempted to influence the referendum in 2014. Some commentators suggested that this was the “first post-Soviet Russian interference in a western democratic process,” the inquiry said.  Another strand of Russian influence in Britain comes from hard cash. Britain has welcomed oligarchs and allowed them to recycle their cash through “Londongrad,” as the capital has been dubbed, where rich Russians are well integrated in the business and social scene. A large network of lawyers, accountants and real estate agents became wittingly or unwittingly de facto agents of the Russian state, the report found. And Russia’s influence extended to the highest levels of companies in Britain. Even political figures, including some members of the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber of Parliament, are in some respects on Moscow’s payroll thanks to business interests linked to Russia. Some work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state. The inquiry was produced by Parliament’s intelligence and security committee, a group of senior lawmakers whose job it is to oversee Britain’s spy agencies. But the report was completed more than a year and a half ago. So why was its release delayed until Tuesday? The report, which paints the government in a particularly unflattering light, was sent to Downing Street last year, but its release was delayed until after a general election in December that gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson a big majority. Then publication was held up again amid haggling over the membership of the committee which had to be reconstituted after the election.']",A report released on Tuesday depicts the failure of successive British governments to combat Russian interference despite ample evidence of meddling.
"Three Decades After His Coup, Sudan’s Former Ruler Is Held to Account",2020-07-21,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — Three decades ago, a little-known army officer named Omar Hassan al-Bashir seized power in Sudan, ushering in a long period of brutal rule that would push the sprawling African country into a series of destabilizing wars, cripple its economy and result in humiliating international isolation. Now Mr. al-Bashir is being called to account for his actions. The autocrat, 76, who was ousted last year following street protests, was led into a courtroom in Khartoum on Tuesday to stand trial for his role in the bloodless 1989 coup that toppled the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi. Also in the dock were 27 of Mr. al-Bashir’s most senior officials, including former vice-presidents, ministers, governors and military officers. Mr. al-Bashir, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment last year on separate corruption charges, faces the death penalty if convicted. Armed policemen wielding batons and tear gas canisters stood guard outside the courthouse, where the accused were led into cages for a brief hearing. Dozens of relatives gathered outside the building, jeering and shouting slogans including “God is great!” The prosecution is a rare instance of a dictator being forced to answer for the putsch that catapulted him to power — even if in Mr. al-Bashir’s case, a key accomplice has already evaded justice. The Islamist cleric Hassan al-Turabi, widely seen as the true architect of the 1989 coup, and the power behind Mr. al-Bashir for many years until they had a falling out, died in 2016 without facing trial. For Mr. al-Bashir, this is one prosecution among many. During last year’s corruption trial, he admitted taking $90 million in bribes from Saudi Arabia’s rulers. But the gravest charges have yet to come before a court. For over a decade, the International Criminal Court at The Hague has sought Mr. al-Bashir over his role in the conflict in the western region of Darfur, where Sudanese troops and allied militias killed, pillaged and raped in a yearslong campaign of ethnically driven violence that resulted in several hundred thousand deaths. The Hague court indicted Mr. al-Bashir a decade ago on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, and charged other senior figures including the former defense minister, Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein, who stood trial alongside Mr. al-Bashir on Tuesday. Although Sudan’s transitional government, which is jointly led by civilian and military leaders, indicated earlier this year that it was ready to send Mr. al-Bashir to The Hague, there has been little sign of that happening. Instead, the new administration has appeared to shy away from a trial on Darfur, probably because its own leaders might also face accusations. Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, a powerful figure in the transitional government, leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a group linked to some of the worst atrocity accusations in Darfur. When Mr. al-Bashir, a brigade commander, took over in 1989, the country was sinking into decline. The army was battling a tenacious uprising in the south, and Mr. al-Mahdi’s elected government was unpopular and beleaguered. After he seized power, Mr. al-Bashir suspended the Parliament and other state institutions, closed Khartoum airport and announced the coup over the radio. Later, he embarked on a vicious purge of potential rivals, imposed Islamic law, and introduced harsh laws that severely restricted freedoms for Sudanese, especially for women. It quickly became clear that the ideological drive for the putsch came from a small group of Islamists led by Mr. al-Turabi, an erudite, Sorbonne-educated cleric who dreamed of leading a Pan-Arab Islamist renaissance. Mr. al-Bashir had a reputation as a malleable, less sophisticated figure. “Bashir was the frontman but the Islamists were more powerful,” said Alex de Waal, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and an expert on Sudan. “They manipulated him.” But Mr. al-Bashir outwitted the ideologues in a series of power struggles that ended with Mr. Turabi’s imprisonment in 1999, leaving Mr. al-Bashir as Sudan’s unchallenged ruler. Sudan was home to Osama bin Laden until 1996, when under American pressure Mr. al-Bashir was forced to expel the Qaeda leader. Later, Mr. al-Bashir softened his Islamist fervor in favor of repairing relations with Sudan’s neighbors and, in 2005, striking a landmark peace deal with southern rebels that led to independence for South Sudan in 2011. Mr. al-Bashir’s iron grip collapsed in April 2019 when, after months of street protests triggered by the price of bread, his own army lieutenants decided his rule had become untenable and ousted him from power. Mr. al-Bashir has dismissed the charges over the 1989 coup as politically motivated — “a political trial par excellence,” one of his lawyers told reporters in December — and footage of Tuesday’s proceedings broadcast on state TV focused on the judge and did not show the ousted autocrat in the packed courtroom. For many Sudanese, though, it was also striking to see the former vice presidents Ali Osman Taha and Bakri Hassan Saleh on trial. Without hearing statements or arguments, the judge adjourned the trial until Aug. 11, when he said it would reconvene in a larger courtroom with more space for relatives and the defendants.']","Omar Hassan al-Bashir, ousted in mass protests last year, is on trial for his role in the military coup that propelled him to power in 1989.

U.K. Cuts Immunity for Some U.S. Diplomats’ Families After Fatal Crash,2020-07-22,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — Britain and the United States have agreed to end a legal loophole that allowed an American woman to flee Britain after she was involved in a car accident that killed a teenager, the British authorities said on Tuesday, almost a year after the crash started a diplomatic tug of war between the two countries and sparked widespread outrage in Britain. The woman, Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, fled Britain under diplomatic immunity weeks after her car collided with the motorcycle of Harry Dunn, 19, near Royal Air Force Croughton, a military base operated by the U.S. Air Force in central England. For nearly a year, Mr. Dunn’s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, have campaigned to have Ms. Sacoolas prosecuted in Britain, going to the White House in October, where President Trump welcomed them and tried to arrange a meeting with Ms. Sacoolas, who he said was waiting in a room nearby. Mr. Dunn’s parents refused to meet her. In January, the United States turned down an extradition request for Ms. Sacoolas, a decision that the British government called “a denial of justice.” The change in the law does not apply to her case, but only to future incidents. The police in Britain have said that Ms. Sacoolas was driving her car on the wrong side of the road in Brackley, a town near the base and about 60 miles northwest of London, at the time of the crash in August. The case put a focus on special diplomatic arrangements affecting Americans who worked at the base and their families. Under the United Nations’ Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, members of diplomatic staff and their families positioned in a foreign country are entitled to immunity. An arrangement between the U.S. and Britain recognized the Americans working at Croughton as embassy staff, but waived this immunity. However, that waiver did not cover the families of the employees. So, while American personnel at the base could not claim immunity in the event of a crime committed outside their duties, their family members could. That is no longer the case. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Wednesday that all American staff members at the Croughton military base would now be subject to the same rules. The changes, which came into effect on Monday but were made public on Wednesday, came a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Britain. Mr. Johnson’s office said he had raised the issue of Ms. Sacoolas with Mr. Pompeo. The waiver arrangement had been restricted to the base, and the changes will not affect broader agreements on immunity for diplomatic staff. American personnel and their families posted elsewhere in Britain will continue to enjoy diplomatic immunity. “We have the deepest sympathy for Harry Dunn’s family,” Mr. Raab said in the statement. “No family should have to experience what they have gone through and I recognize that these changes will not bring Harry back.” In a written statement to Parliament, Mr. Raab said that the loophole “could not in future be used in the same way as in the tragic case of Harry Dunn.” Mr. Dunn’s family welcomed the decision but said they would continue to press for Ms. Sacoolas to stand trial in Britain. “We now need Dominic Raab to work with us to make sure that we get her back to the U.K. to face justice at some point soon,” Ms. Charles told the BBC. “We always live with hope that one day she might just decide of her own accord to put herself on a plane and come back over here. We definitely will keep the pressure up.”']","An immunity waiver at a military base has been widened to cover employees’ families, after a diplomatic tug of war over the death of a British teenager."
Spain’s Reopening Stumbles as Virus Cases Rise Among Young People,2020-07-23,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — After already enjoying a long night of graduation celebrations, a throng of young people poured into the Babylon discothèque at 5 a.m. to continue partying in the southern Spanish city of Córdoba. Two weeks later, 91 people linked to the Babylon’s 400 identified partygoers have tested positive for the coronavirus and the regional authorities are still struggling to trace all those who entered the club that night, or who later came into contact with them. Spain lifted a nationwide state of emergency on June 21 as it emerged from a strict three-month lockdown imposed to gain control over one of Europe’s worst outbreaks. The rapid spread of the virus in Spain left some 28,400 people dead by the official count — almost surely understated — with most of them over the age of 70. Since then, new coronavirus cases have quadrupled — now concentrated among young people — as the left-wing coalition government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez returned responsibility for a safe reopening to Spain’s regions. That has made Spain a mosaic of new rules — some less stringent or more loosely enforced than others — and an uneven patchwork of successes mixed with alarming failures. The country is now grappling with 224 local outbreaks, Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa, told Parliament on Wednesday. Several other European countries, from Portugal to Germany, have faced significant local outbreaks after coming out of lockdown, but most of those were more limited in scale and snuffed out relatively quickly. Authorities isolated pockets of new cases and traced those who may have been exposed. The resurgence in Spain has underscored not only the need for vigilance as societies reopen, but also for supporting measures like additional testing and contact tracing — steps that Spain remains ill equipped to carry out. The result is that hundreds of thousands of people in various parts of the country have been forced to return to temporary lockdowns, notably in the northeastern region of Catalonia, an area especially hard-hit before. But public tolerance for new lockdowns may prove lower than in March and April, when the nationwide quarantines were largely obeyed but only grudgingly accepted. Young people in particular are chafing at the restrictions, especially because they are less likely to become gravely ill as a result of infection. While the demographic shift toward young people has reduced the risk that Spain’s health care sector will once more get saturated with Covid-19 patients, as happened in late March, it has raised a new concern about asymptomatic transmissions, which make the need for testing all the more pressing. Yet health experts are warning that Spain continues to fall short in terms of testing for Covid-19. “Spain should now design a specific strategy to identify asymptomatic patients,” Helena Legido-Quigley, an associate professor of public health at the University of Singapore. Overall, she added, “testing capacity and contact tracing could be much improved” in Spain. Mr. Illa, Spain’s health minister, warned recently that his Socialist-led coalition government was ready to reactivate Spain’s state of emergency if it became clear that regions were not able to control the latest outbreaks. But Mr. Illa forms parts of a fragile minority government that has faced fierce criticism from opposition parties over the government’s response to the pandemic. This week, María Jesús Montero, the minister who is the government’s spokeswoman, sent a special message of caution to “people who are younger, because some of the outbreaks are linked to the behavior in nightlife venues or places where a large number of people gather.” In the case of Catalonia, which has had one of the worst resurgences of the virus, the situation has been complicated by disagreement between politicians and local judges over who has the authority to put people back under lockdown. Last week, the Catalan regional leader, Quim Torra, urged, rather than ordered, about three million people living around Barcelona to stay indoors and “demonstrate that we are a society of solidarity.” Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help: Many people ignored Mr. Torra’s recommendation, however, and the local police were even forced to close some of Barcelona’s packed beaches over the weekend because of the risk of infection. While the most serious outbreaks have recently occurred in northeastern Spain, only two of Spain’s 17 regions — Madrid and the Canary Islands — have not reimposed requirements to wear face masks at all times outdoors. Enforcement has proved to be complicated, not only at outdoor gatherings but also in places like nightclubs that have been allowed to reopen under occupancy limits. In Córdoba, there are conflicting accounts of what happened in the Babylon club, which was restricted to 40 percent of its 500-person capacity to allow social distancing. Regional officials say they have identified about 400 people who went to the club that night, though its management has insisted that no more than 140 were inside at any one moment. The club is now closed while an investigation continues. Some regions of Spain are reporting a particularly strong uptick in the number of cases among adolescents. In the northern region of Aragón, where authorities said this week that they could contain the outbreaks without a return to lockdown, the rate of infection rose sevenfold in one month among people tested between ages 10 and 19. Some recent outbreaks have been linked to vulnerable sectors of society, notably seasonal fruit pickers in northeastern Spain, who are often migrant workers. In recent days, Spanish hoteliers and travel operators have reported more booking cancellations since the new outbreaks and lockdowns were announced. The latest outbreaks could threaten cross-border travel in Europe, at a time when some tourism destinations are already suffering because airlines have only reopened some of their routes. Last week, Jean Castex, the new French prime minister, said his government was monitoring the situation in neighboring Catalonia to decide whether France’s border with Spain should be kept open. On Wednesday, Reyes Maroto, the Spanish tourism minister, urged France not to close the border. “We are cohabiting with the virus, but this does not mean that we cannot travel and recover some kind of normalcy,” Ms. Maroto told a conference in Madrid.']","Covid-19 outbreaks are putting Spain back under pressure, but this time the focus is on younger people and the risk that they are unwittingly spreading the virus."
Refugee and Author Long Detained by Australia Gets Asylum in New Zealand,2020-07-24,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"['CAIRNS, Australia — Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish-Iranian refugee and writer who documented abuses under Australia’s tough immigration policies during his yearslong detention on a remote Pacific island, has been granted asylum in New Zealand. Mr. Boochani has spent the past several months in Christchurch, where he applied for refugee status after being given a temporary visa to attend a writers’ festival last November. On Thursday — which was also Mr. Boochani’s 37th birthday, and exactly seven years since he was first detained on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea — he received official notification that his application for a one-year working visa in New Zealand had been successful. Mr. Boochani said he planned to apply for permanent residency, which is a pathway to citizenship. “It’s like the end of a chapter of my life,” he said, adding that his news was bittersweet because he feared for those still being detained by the Australian authorities. Under the Australian government’s strict policies for those who attempt to reach the country by boat, thousands of people, many from the Middle East and Africa, have been detained indefinitely on Manus and the island nation of Nauru. “The policy exists, and so that’s why it’s really difficult to fully enjoy this,” he said. Mr. Boochani said that the vast differences in the way he had been treated by the Australian and New Zealand authorities revealed a chasm in their leadership on human rights. “We ask people in the international community to look at this country, to look at Australia and what they have done and what they are doing,” he said, adding that he hoped others in detention would also eventually be given asylum. “They must release them.” Mr. Boochani, who formerly worked as a journalist with the Kurdish-language magazine Werya, fled Iran in 2013 after the police arrested several of his colleagues and raided his office. He spent a few months in Indonesia before trying to travel to Australia by boat, but he was intercepted by the Australian Navy and sent to Manus Island. There, he documented human rights abuses against himself and others, raising awareness of the squalid conditions and deteriorating mental health of the men he lived with — many of whom had fled persecution in their home countries. Mr. Boochani’s posts on social media, which detailed self-harm and suicides by detainees, as well as inadequate access to health care, helped expose policies that had largely been obscured by extremely limited access to the camps for journalists and activists. In early 2019, Mr. Boochani was awarded Australia’s highest-paying literary prize for his book “No Friend but the Mountains,” which was written entirely via WhatsApp. It further detailed abuses in the camps, cementing him as a voice for those who had largely been silenced by Australia’s strict policies. He could not attend the awards ceremony because of his detainment. In November, he received a visitor visa to New Zealand in order to attend the WORD literary festival in Christchurch. He has been living there since, working as a researcher with the University of Canterbury.']","Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish-Iranian exile, said the news showed the vast differences between the two neighboring countries on human rights."
Couple Charged With Rioting After Hong Kong Protest Are Found Not Guilty,2020-07-24,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — A newlywed couple who were among the first to be charged with the serious crime of rioting in connection with the protests in Hong Kong were found not guilty on Friday. A teenager was also acquitted. The judge in the case said there was no direct evidence against the defendants, who were arrested on July 28 near the site of clashes between protesters and the police. They could have been sent to prison for seven years if convicted. The couple, Elaine To and Henry Tong, who run a gym, made headlines in Hong Kong when they got married in August, days after the charges were brought against them. “Our emotions were verging on a breakdown before the verdict,” Mr. Tong told reporters outside the courthouse on Friday. “We did have a sigh of relief after they cleared us.” The couple bowed and held hands as supporters chanted, “There are no rioters, only tyranny!” Hundreds of people have been charged with rioting since the antigovernment protests began in June of last year. When the police began making arrests on that charge, it was seen as an escalation in the authorities’ response, because of the length of the potential sentences. Dropping the characterization of protesters as “rioters” has been one of the movement’s main demands. But since then, the potential consequences of protesting in Hong Kong have become much more grave, with China’s imposition last month of a harsh national security law on the semiautonomous city. The law, which targets political activity and even speech that is seen as challenging Beijing’s rule, gives mainland Chinese security forces sweeping powers to operate in the city and in some cases authorizes life sentences — even the possibility of being tried on the mainland, where the rights and legal protections guaranteed by Hong Kong’s independent judicial system are unknown. In the case that ended in acquittal on Friday, prosecutors had noted that all three defendants had worn black, like many in the protest movement, when they were arrested. Ms. To and Mr. Tong were also carrying medical supplies. But that did not indicate that the couple had participated in a riot, said Judge Anthony Kwok of Hong Kong’s District Court, who handed down the verdict — only that they were working as volunteer medics, as numerous people did during the protests. The third defendant, a student named Natalie Lee, who was reported by Hong Kong news outlets to be 17 years old, had also been wearing a hard hat and had wrapped plastic film around her arms, to protect her skin from tear gas. But Judge Kwok accepted the argument that while many protesters wore such gear, it did not pose a public threat. “Unlike the rioting cases handled by Hong Kong’s courts in the past, there is no direct evidence in this case,” the judge wrote. He added that defendants in criminal cases are always presumed innocent under Hong Kong’s common-law system. Rioting can carry a 10-year sentence in Hong Kong, but the penalty is limited to seven years if the case is heard in the District Court, as opposed to the High Court. The three defendants were also acquitted of unlawful assembly. Ms. To and Mr. Tong were found guilty of possessing radio communication devices without a license, and were each fined $1,290. “We won’t celebrate because there are many people yet to have a fair ruling,” Mr. Tong said. “We hope to celebrate with everyone after they have all had a fair ruling.” In May, a 22-year-old protester was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to rioting. Last month, a student was found not guilty of the charge, the first demonstrator to be acquitted of rioting in connection with the unrest last year. As of June 30, when the national security law took effect, 9,216 people had been arrested in Hong Kong in connection with the protests, which began in response to a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. Of those arrested, 1,972 have been formally charged, 653 of them on rioting charges, according to the Hong Kong police, who have been accused by critics of making indiscriminate arrests.']","A judge said there was no direct evidence against the two, who made headlines when they got married days after their arrest.

Crowd Catches 2 French Children Who Leapt From Burning Apartment,2020-07-23,By Elian Peltier,"['As a plume of thick black smoke billowed from their burning apartment, a 10-year-old boy dangled a younger child from an open third-floor window, grasping on to the back of his shirt. The apartment’s balcony was engulfed in flames, and the two children appeared trapped. Then, as onlookers screamed, the older boy dropped the younger one, age 3, into the arms of a group of adults 30 feet below. They caught him. Moments later, the older boy lowered himself out of the window and jumped into the outstretched arms of those standing below. Both children were unharmed. The dramatic rescue that unfolded on Tuesday in the French city of Grenoble was caught on video and drew widespread admiration for the quick thinking of the children and the actions of the good Samaritans who broke their fall. Two of the six adults who appeared to have participated in the rescue broke their arms, according to French news reports. All have been hailed as heroes. “It is together that they could save the children,” Éric Piolle, the mayor of Grenoble, said in a statement, as he praised the “heroic rescue.” At least 17 people were injured in the fire in Grenoble, a city of 160,000, according to news reports, and the cause is still being investigated. The two children were hospitalized for smoke inhalation according to French media. As for the rescuers, they were humble about their roles. “The children gave us the courage, because they decided to jump,” Athoumani Walid, one of the men whose arm was broken, told France 24. It is not the first time that a dramatic rescue of a child dangling from an apartment has been caught on camera in France. In May 2018, Mamoudou Gassama, a 22-year-old Malian man, scaled four floors of a Paris building to save a toddler hanging from a balcony. Hailed as the “Spider-Man of the 18th,” for the arrondissement where the rescue unfolded, Mr. Gassama joined the city’s fire brigade after he was granted legal residency in the country.']","The boys, aged 3 and 10, landed safely after people gathered below to break their fall."
North Korea Declares Emergency After Suspected Covid-19 Case,2020-07-25,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Sunday that it had locked down a city near its border with South Korea and declared a “maximum” national emergency after finding what its leader, Kim Jong-un, said could be the country’s first case of Covid-19 there. It issued the high alert after a North Korean who had defected to South Korea three years ago but secretly crossed back into the North’s Kaesong City last Sunday was “suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said on Sunday. After running several tests, the health authorities put the person and contacts under quarantine, as well as those who have been in Kaesong City in the last five days, the North Korean news agency said. While reporting the incident, the agency stopped short of calling it the country’s first case of the coronavirus, saying the test result was “uncertain.” But it was serious enough that Mr. Kim called an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Political Bureau on Saturday, where he admitted that his country may have its first outbreak of Covid-19. “There happened a critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying, while declaring “a state of emergency” around Kaesong City and ordering his country to shift to “the maximum emergency system and issue a top-class alert.” Mr. Kim “took the pre-emptive measure of \u200b\u200btotally blocking Kaesong City and isolating each district and region from the other” on Friday shortly after he received a report on the situation, the North Korean news agency said. Until now North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated countries, has repeatedly said that it has no case of Covid-19, although outside experts questioned the claim. A Covid-19 outbreak could seriously test North Korea’s underequipped public health system and its economy, already struggling under international sanctions. International relief agencies have been providing test kits and other assistance to help the country fight any potential spread of Covid-19. North Korea has taken some of the most drastic actions of any country against the virus, and did so sooner than most other nations. It sealed its borders in late January, shutting off business with neighboring China, which accounts for nine-tenths of its external trade. It clamped down on the smugglers who keep its thriving unofficial markets functioning. It quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. \u200bThe government’s ability to control the movement of people\u200b also bolsters its disease-control efforts. But decades of isolation and international sanctions have raised concerns that \u200bit lacks the medical supplies to fight an outbreak, which many fear has already occurred. \u200bNorth Korea’s senior disease-control officials attended the Political Bureau meeting Mr. Kim called on Saturday, while other senior government and party officials from across the country watched it through video conferencing, state media reported. Mr. Kim ordered them to fight the spread of the virus “\u200bwith a sense of boundless responsibility, loyalty and devotion.” \u200bNorth Korea did not reveal the identity of the North Korean runaway who it said returned home with the possible virus infection from South Korea. The South Korean government did not immediately react to the North Korean claim. The North said it was investigating a military unit for failing to catch the runaway when the person first slipped through the inter-Korean border to defect to the South three years ago, and said it planned to “administer a severe punishment and take necessary measures.” The defector returned home last Sunday after illegally crossing back, it said. More than 30,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the early 1990s. But some have failed to adapt to life in the capitalist South Korea and fled back to the North. Still, defections across the inter-Korean border, one of the world’s most heavily armed, are rare.']",The country locked down a city near its border with South Korea.

The Meeting That Brings the International Desk Closer to Home,2020-07-24,By Alissa J. Rubin,"['Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. Alissa J. Rubin is the Baghdad bureau chief. She had expected to leave Iraq at the end of March, but the country’s airports and land borders shut down abruptly that month and she was restricted to staying in Baghdad for more than 18 weeks.  BAGHDAD — At The New York Times, foreign correspondents are a disparate group. We work in different countries, in different time zones, in wildly different cultures. Only rarely do we know our colleagues in other regions, and when we do run into them, we often feel a bit shy talking to them — what would Bangkok and Warsaw have in common? But the coronavirus changed that. It gave us common ground. In ways we never could have anticipated, Covid-19 turned out to be a leveler — of differences between editors and reporters, Sinophiles and Europeanists, newer reporters and “old hands.” What brought us closer together was a weekly group video meeting that began as a result of a voluntary group session with a psychiatrist. The idea was to help those far from home feel less anxious as the pandemic spread to more and more of the countries where we lived and worked. About 90 of us showed up virtually for that first meeting, unsure of what to expect. The psychiatrist, Anthony Feinstein, a specialist in post-traumatic stress disorder among journalists, is a down-to-earth Canadian who never uses jargon. One piece of advice that stayed with many of us was to focus on what we could change — when we went to bed, for instance — and not on what we couldn’t, namely the coronavirus. The first call was awkward, as if we were on a first date. Many of us had never seen or heard one another before. But even as Dr. Feinstein was talking, something surprising happened. Some of us started using the chat function to ask each other direct questions. And multiple people started answering. It was as if someone had turned on a faucet. Despite the distances between us, we were not alone. Michael Slackman, the assistant managing editor who oversees the International desk, noticed that and asked everyone to come back the next week — if they wanted to. Amazingly, with no duress, almost the same number of people came. Several months later, there are roughly 40 people who still meet weekly. The call is convenient for some, less so for others — it happens at 7:45 a.m. in New York but often has correspondents in Tokyo, where it is 8:45 p.m., and in Bogotá, Colombia, where it is 6:45 a.m. We discuss the mundane, such as ordering food or which Netflix or Amazon Prime series we are watching, but we also discuss the professional: the pros and cons of working with sources through video; long-distance transportation options (for those of us who can travel); where to stay (hotel or Airbnb?). And, because all of us are living the story that we are reporting, sometimes we talk about the deeply personal, like writing frustrations and strategies for avoiding depression during a lockdown (one suggestion: have a call every day with a colleague). One correspondent described feeling much more vulnerable to editors’ comments or lack thereof because we were cut off from friends and from our normal lives. Another talked about her partner being out of work and the pressure of becoming the main breadwinner. Ernesto Londoño, the Rio de Janeiro bureau chief, offered advice on meditation. Chris Buckley, a China correspondent who had been through a draconian three-month lockdown in Wuhan, gave recommendations on structuring our days and pacing ourselves when time seemed to fall into a black hole. Greg Winter, the International desk’s managing editor, told a story about trying to coax his daughter to overcome her reluctance and go outside for just a little exercise in New York. We talked, too, about the United States’ struggle with race — which has touched The Times as well and is affecting our thinking about how we write and report, no matter whether we are in Minnesota or Malaysia. Why do we keep showing up for this meeting? Because it has become our town square, our group kitchen table, a place where we see people with whom we share a way of life and can talk about all that we’ve lost without being judged. That, too, is something we are carrying into our reporting and writing — that the world right now is more desperate than before; more unsure how to move forward; and struggling, with illness, with impoverishment, with loss. At one meeting, Ben Hubbard, the Beirut bureau chief, brought his 4-month-old daughter, cradling her in his arms, as he talked about doing virtual events to promote his new book on Saudi Arabia’s crown prince. His daughter was quiet and seemed to be watching us, and Ben looked happy. It was a moment of shared respite, and even hope, in a dark time.']","Stationed all over the world, my colleagues and I can feel isolated.

"With Officials’ Backing, Dubious Virus Remedies Surge in Latin America",2020-07-23,"By María Silvia Trigo, Anatoly Kurmanaev and José María León Cabrera","['TARIJA, Bolivia — In Cochabamba, high in the Bolivian Andes, people line up daily outside pharmacies on the central plaza, eager to buy the scarce elixir they hope will ward off Covid-19: chlorine dioxide, a kind of bleach used to disinfect swimming pools and floors. Experts say drinking it is pointless at best and hazardous at worst. But in Bolivia, where people have been hospitalized after ingesting chlorine dioxide, regional authorities are testing it on prison inmates, the national Senate last week approved its use and a top lawmaker has threatened to expel the World Health Organization for opposing its medical use. Julio César Baldivieso, a local soccer hero and former national team captain, told a local television station that because Cochabamba’s hospitals “don’t have tests, they don’t have materials, they don’t have protective equipment,” he and his family had turned to chlorine dioxide to treat their coronavirus symptoms. Bolivians have a lot of company in resorting to unproven and even dangerous treatments to prevent or treat infection. In every part of the world, hard science has had to compete for attention with pet theories, rumors and traditional beliefs during this pandemic, as in the past. But interest in dubious medicines has been especially high recently in Latin America, where the virus is raging uncontrolled and many political leaders on the right and left are promoting them, whether out of genuine faith or a desire to offer hope and deflect blame. In a region where few people can afford quality medical care, alternative treatments are widely touted on social media and exploited by profiteers. “The people feel desperate when confronted with Covid-19,” said Santiago Ron, an Ecuadorean biology professor, who has clashed with proponents of supposed treatments, including lawmakers. “They are very vulnerable to pseudoscientific promises.” Coronavirus has infected more than three million people and killed about 160,000 in Latin America, according to official figures, making the region one of the worst-hit by the pandemic. And experts and statistical analyses indicate that the real toll is far higher, concealed by limited testing and medical resources, and by some governments’ resistance to publicly acknowledging the scope of the crisis. Covid-19 has battered already-fragile health care systems, and lockdown measures have devastated economies without bringing the virus under control. Scientists are testing a wide range of unproven treatments, but the odds of any one of them being helpful are considered low, and some of them are known to be potentially harmful. In many cases, there is no solid evidence yet as to whether they work against the coronavirus. One such drug generating intense interest is ivermectin, which is used to treat intestinal worms. Two Brazilian cabinet ministers announced on Monday that they had tested positive for the coronavirus, and one of them said that he was treating it with ivermectin, among other drugs. The government of Peru bought ivermectin to fight the pandemic, and has continued to promote it, even after the W.H.O. said it should not be used for coronavirus. That has fueled the explosion of an illegal market for the veterinary version of ivermectin, forcing the Peruvian government — and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — to warn citizens against using drugs intended for farm animals. Even so, in the small town of Nauta, in the Peruvian Amazon, the local government and religious groups went so far as to give veterinary ivermectin to adults and children as young as 4, according to local media and a human rights group. The United States also has witnessed its top government official promoting unfounded treatments. President Trump has mused about treating the virus with powerful lights or disinfectant injections. He has repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, calling it a “game changer” in the pandemic, despite scientific research to the contrary, and has said he took it for two weeks. But in the United States, hydroxychloroquine does not have nearly the official imprimatur that it does in parts of Latin America. In Brazil, with the world’s second-highest coronavirus caseload and death toll after the United States, President Jair Bolsonaro has relentlessly promoted the drug — even after he, himself, developed Covid-19, despite taking the drug for months. He has ordered the military to mass-produce it, and after his diagnosis he waved a package of it before cheering supporters. Governments in El Salvador, Peru and Paraguay have bought hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus. Studies have found that the drug did not lessen the chance of infection, reduce the severity of Covid-19 or speed recovery. But it is potentially dangerous, particularly for people with abnormal heart rhythms. In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro’s government, which is struggling to provide even running water and soap to crumbling hospitals, has boasted of obtaining from its ally Cuba tens of thousands of doses of a drug, interferon alfa-2b, used against viruses and cancers, to fight the pandemic. Government clinics now require patients with coronavirus symptoms to take the drug. But there has been no definitive evidence yet that this particular drug, one of many in the interferon class, works against the coronavirus, and in the United States, the National Institutes of Health does not currently recommend its use in patients with Covid-19. Following Bolivia’s example, Ecuador’s Congress recently discussed whether to allow chlorine dioxide as a coronavirus treatment, and 10 local Roman Catholic bishops have called for its use. The chemical has long been marketed without official approval, including in the United States, as a cure for ailments from AIDS to autism. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly said it has no medical value and can have potentially lethal effects, including “severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration and acute liver failure.” At least 10 Bolivians have been hospitalized with chlorine dioxide poisoning in recent weeks, according to the Health Ministry. But on Wednesday, Efraín Chambi, the majority leader of the national Senate, said his party would ask the W.H.O. to leave the country if it continues to warn people not to take chlorine dioxide. “They are not doing any favors to the Bolivian people,” he said. “We believe they are on the side of large multinational” companies. After successfully containing the disease for months, Bolivia, one of Latin America’s poorest countries, succumbed to an aggressive outbreak this month that has overwhelmed hospitals. This week, the police collected hundreds of bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims from streets and homes in the cities of Santa Cruz and La Paz, and on Thursday, the government postponed national elections from September to October, citing health concerns. The virus swiftly swept through the highest echelons of power, infecting the interim president, Jeanine Añez, and half of her cabinet, fueling a sense of helplessness. Politicians and popular public figures began promoting chlorine dioxide as an alternative treatment. The opposition-controlled Senate last week passed a bill that would allow local governments to supply the solution free for medical use, despite protests from the Health Ministry. Ms. Añez has remained silent on the controversy, as her election bid loses support. In Cochabamba, in the center of the country, where a pint bottle of chlorine dioxide solution sells for $8 — when it can be found — residents blocked the road to the municipal waste treatment plant until local authorities promised to provide it free. Mr. Baldivieso, 48, the soccer coach, said he and his entire family began drinking the chemical after first experiencing coronavirus symptoms. He said he had to wait 15 days for a test result, which came back positive. “What if we just did nothing all that time?” he said. In the Bolivian capital, Sucre, local health officials last week began testing chlorine dioxide on 200 local prison inmates and guards, some with coronavirus symptoms. The prison chief, Ludwin Miranda, said that all the participants had signed consent forms. In San José de Chiquitos, an eastern Bolivian town of 30,000, the mayor distributed chlorine dioxide to local medical centers to treat the virus. “The application of chlorine dioxide has produced perfect results in the recuperation of critical patients,” the mayor, Germaín Caballero, told a local television station last week. “We have managed to control the pandemic.” Medical experts say chlorine dioxide is, at best, a placebo — and, as with any placebo, people might credit it for their recoveries. Those who advocate chlorine dioxide “create a false sense of security,” Virgilio Prieto, director of epidemiology at Bolivia’s Health Ministry, said in an interview. “By promoting its indiscriminate and irresponsible use, they are putting the population at risk.” María Silvia Trigo reported from Tarija, Bolivia; Anatoly Kurmanaev from Caracas, Venezuela, and José María León Cabrera from Quito, Ecuador.

Paris Deputy Mayor Quits After Protests Over Links to Pedophile Writer,2020-07-24,By Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — A longtime deputy mayor of Paris resigned on Thursday following protests over his links with Gabriel Matzneff, a French writer who openly promoted pedophilia for decades while benefiting from the protection of French elites. The deputy mayor, Christophe Girard, 64, who oversees culture for the Paris government, said in a statement that he had no desire to “ruin my life any longer” nor to “justify myself permanently for something that does not exist.” Mr. Girard’s resignation as deputy mayor — he remains a Paris city councilor — comes against a backdrop of renewed calls against impunity for sexual abuse and sexism in French society. He had received full support from the city’s newly re-elected mayor, Anne Hidalgo, who has defended her colleague and on Thursday morning told the newspaper Le Parisien that Mr. Girard was “not in any way involved” in the case against Mr. Matzneff, adding that the accusations against the deputy mayor were unsubstantiated. But in recent weeks, calls for Mr. Girard to step down have grown, from both activists and fellow politicians, including members of his own coalition. Mr. Matzneff himself has spoken of his ties to the politician. In 1986, Mr. Girard, then a top aide to the designer Yves Saint Laurent, helped arrange payment for a hotel where Mr. Matzneff stayed for two years to convalesce from eye surgery, Mr. Matzneff said when interviewed earlier this year. But Mr. Matzneff — who at the time had already published a book that offered a defense of pedophilia — used the new accommodation to continue meeting with Vanessa Springora, then a teenager, who in January released a scathing account of being abused by the writer. The new living arrangement allowed Mr. Matzneff to evade visits from the authorities, Ms. Springora wrote. Mr. Matzneff later dedicated a book written during that time to Mr. Girard. Mr. Matzneff is set to stand trial next year, charged with promoting the sexual abuse of children. Prosecutors also launched a rape investigation over abuse of a number of teenage girls, whom he wrote about in his books for years. Mr. Girard was questioned in March by the police as a witness in the investigation. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Girard condemned the abuses but denied almost any knowledge of the writer’s pedophilia and said that he had never read even a single book by the author, though one was dedicated to him. He did acknowledged knowing Mr. Matzneff “for a while” and said that “it is possible” that he helped him obtain a lifetime annual stipend from France’s National Book Center in 2002. Mr. Girard was the city’s deputy mayor for culture by that time. “Yes, it’s a friendly relationship, since it’s someone I have a coffee with, at a bookstore, at a restaurant with other people,” Mr. Girard said. “But it’s not a personal relationship.” Mr. Girard’s explanations have done little to quieten calls for his removal by several city councilors, many from the Green party, who have demanded his suspension and asked that an internal investigation over his ties to Mr. Matzneff be opened. “He cannot be deputy for culture to the mayor of Paris with what happened before,” said Alice Coffin, a Green city councilor who was protesting in front of Paris’ city hall on Thursday. “How do you expect him to be credible?” About forty protesters stood alongside Ms. Coffin, waving signs reading “No deputy for rape culture” and “Denial at Paris city hall,” as Ms. Hidalgo held her first council meeting since her re-election in June. On Friday, Ms. Coffin welcomed Mr. Girard’s resignation, but condemned impunity among political elites. “They do not understand that it is not possible to appoint personalities whose behavior contributes to the oppression of women in France,” she said. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron’s appointment of two ministers, one previously accused of rape and another known for insensitive remarks, drew outrage from French feminist groups.']",Christophe Girard’s resignation followed growing calls from activists and fellow city councilors that he step down over his links to Gabriel Matzneff.
Hungary’s Independent Press Takes Another Blow and Reporters Quit,2020-07-24,By Benjamin Novak and Marc Santora,"['BUDAPEST — Hungary’s most widely read news site was thrown into disarray this week after the organization’s editor in chief was fired and scores of journalists quit in protest as the government moved closer to near-complete control over the country’s media landscape. A decade into Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s quest to transform Hungary into an “illiberal” nation, where he controls nearly all levers of the state and uses them to maintain his grip on power, the takeover of Index.hu’s advertising unit by an Orban ally was part of a broader effort to limit dissenting voices and silence critics. The potential loss of the news site as a check on the government was a particularly painful blow to the small but determined coterie of independent journalists left working in the country. The site was one of many independent media outlets in Central Europe that have come under sustained financial and political pressure from governments bent on controlling public discourse. More than half the staff at Index, some 70 employees, announced their resignations on Friday after the firing of the editor, Szabolcs Dull. “We have emphasized for years that we have two requirements for Index to continue operating independently: that there be no outside interference in Index’s content or in the composition or structure of Index’s staff,” the group said in a statement. “The firing of Szabolcs Dull violated the latter of these requirements. His dismissal was a clear interference in the composition of the staff.” The steady decline of independent news outlets is part of the slide toward autocratic rule in Hungary and, to a lesser extent, in Poland. Those concerns were key sticking points in the debate over the European Union’s $857 billion pandemic recovery plan and whether Hungary and Poland should be penalized financially. In the end, recovery money was not tied in a significant way to the behavior of member states, appeasing Poland and Hungary, and setting up a possible clash as the deal moves to the European Parliament for final approval. Earlier this month, Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, narrowly won re-election after a bitter campaign in which the media was a frequent target. Mr. Duda accused Germany of trying to influence the result through media outlets owned by German companies. The government even summoned Germany’s charges-d’affaires to complain about the matter, and has yet to approve Germany’s incoming ambassador. After the election, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice Party, vowed to press ahead with plans to limit media ownership by foreign companies. “The media in Poland should be Polish,” the party leader declared after the victory. Since coming into power in 2015, Law and Justice has transformed state television into a propaganda arm of the government, applied financial pressure on Polish media by preventing all state-related entities from advertising with critical outlets, and waged aggressive campaigns against journalists critical of the government. Poland fell to 62nd place out of 180 countries ranked in the World Press Freedom Index in 2020, dropping from 18th in 2015. The election results are being challenged in the country’s Supreme Court, with one of the accusations being that the Law and Justice party’s control over state television created an unfair playing field. The Polish government has often followed the path set by Mr. Orban, who has transformed the media landscape in Hungary despite European Union pressure to change course. When Mr. Orban returned to power in 2010, he and his allies immediately went to work overhauling the country’s democratic framework. A landslide victory at the polls in 2010 allowed them to unilaterally rewrite Hungary’s constitution and change its electoral laws to favor their party. Since then, they have secured constitutional supermajorities in two subsequent elections, despite receiving less than 50 percent of the popular vote. The Constitutional Court has been stacked and lower courts overhauled, public media and most of the country’s private media have come under the control of the prime minister’s allies, and independent watchdog institutions have been stripped of influence. In late 2018, hundreds of nominally independent media outlets controlled by the prime minister’s allies were given to another foundation controlled by Mr. Orban’s confidants. Media and competition regulators were barred from scrutinizing the transactions, according to a decree issued by Mr. Orban in early December 2018, on grounds that the ownership changes were of “strategic national interest.” Index, which traces its roots to the advent of internet news in Hungary, had largely weathered many political storms over the past decade. It has reported critically of Mr. Orban’s government, prominently featuring stories of Russian meddling in Hungary, alleged graft involving politicians and individuals close to Mr. Orban’s inner circle, and by chronicling other government policies widely condemned as assaults on democratic institutions. In March, as Europe struggled to contain the coronavirus, Miklos Vaszily, a media executive with close ties to Mr. Orban’s allies, acquired 50 percent of Index’s advertising business. The move prompted concern from journalists and free press advocates, not least because of Mr. Vaszily’s role in overhauling media outlets, including Origo, a site once regarded as one of Hungary’s most reputable independent news organizations. On June 21, local media reports indicated the leadership at Index planned to overhaul the website’s staff, essentially turning reporters into outside contributors. The staff declared the plan a threat to its independence, warning of a concerted attempt to expose the publication to heightened political interference. Within days, the editor in chief was removed from the company’s board, its chief executive officer resigned, as did an incoming C.E.O. The matter remained at a standstill until Wednesday, when Mr. Dull, the chief editor, was fired by Laszlo Bodolai, head of the foundation that exercises ownership of the publication. Mr. Bodolai accused Mr. Dull of being unable to quell internal anxiety at Index, endangering the business. In a statement released after his departure, Mr. Dull said he always acted with the interests of his staff in mind. “It is no coincidence that Index’s staff felt at risk,” he wrote, adding that the recent events have convinced him that Hungary needs a newspaper where content is not decided by “outside powers.” A last-ditch attempt by the news outlet’s staff failed to convince the organization’s management to rehire the dismissed editor in chief. “We don’t know what is happening,” Veronika Munk, the deputy editor in chief, said Thursday afternoon. “I firmly feel that for many in the staff work has ended at Index.” Through a windfall of state advertising contracts, which often promote conspiracy theories and attacks on the European Union, media entities under the control of Mr. Orban’s allies have flourished. They have been instrumental in promulgating sweeping state-funded propaganda campaigns that tap into anti-Semitic tropes reminiscent of the interwar period. “Imagine all the media in a U.S. state were to come under the ownership of a single political group,” says Gabor Polyak of Mertek Media Monitor, a media think tank, “and all of these media outlets are funded by taxpayer money.” In 2018, the European Parliament voted resoundingly to initiate proceedings against Mr. Orban’s government for what critics say are systemic threats to Hungary’s rule of law and democracy. The process could strip Mr. Orban of his vote in the European Council. At the debate, Mr. Orban rejected criticism of his stewardship of Hungary. “We would never resort to silencing those who disagree with us,” the prime minister said.']","The concentration of control of the media in Hungary by the government is part of a troubling pattern in Central Europe, where Poland’s press also faces pressure following a presidential election."
Iranian Civilian Jet Swerves to Avoid American Warplane in Syria,2020-07-23,"By Vivian Yee, Farnaz Fassihi and Eric Schmitt","['BEIRUT, Lebanon — An Iranian passenger plane en route from Iran to Beirut swerved and dropped abruptly on Thursday to avoid a nearby American fighter jet, injuring several passengers before landing in Beirut. Videos broadcast by Iranian and pro-Iran Lebanese media, which said the footage was taken by passengers, showed a fighter jet flying alongside the passenger plane, operated by Mahan Air, a privately owned Iranian airline. Passengers then screamed as sudden turbulence seized the plane. In the aftermath, one video showed a passenger with his face and head bloodied, as well as a man lying down, apparently unconscious, while someone tended to him. Oxygen masks dangled overhead. Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said in a statement later Thursday that an Air Force F-15 on “a routine air mission” near a small American military base in southern Syria had conducted “a standard visual inspection of a Mahan Air passenger airliner.” American fighter jets fly daily patrols near the base, Al-Tanf, where 150 to 200 U.S. troops train Syrian fighters, known as Maghawir al Thawra, who are fighting the Islamic State. Captain Urban said the encounter on Thursday was conducted at “a safe distance of approximately 1,000 meters” and was done to “ensure the safety of coalition personnel.” “Once the F-15 pilot identified the aircraft as a Mahan Air passenger plane,” Captain Urban added, “the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft.” He said the encounter was done “in accordance with international standards.” A U.S. military official said a second U.S. Air Force F-15 was at least two miles away from the Mahan Air jetliner, but only one of the U.S. aircraft closed to about 1,000 meters. Iranian state television, citing an interview with the Mahan Air pilot, had reported earlier that the fighter jets were American. Lebanese media said an elderly passenger had been taken to a hospital affiliated with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia and political party. Lebanese civil aviation authorities said the plane had been carrying 150 passengers, some of whom suffered minor injuries. The American base at Al-Tanf, which sits near southern Syria’s border with Jordan and Iraq, is strategically located to block Iran from controlling a land route through Iraq to Syria and Lebanon. In recent months, the American-backed Syrian forces have skirmished with roving bands of suspected Islamic State fighters near Al-Tanf. In May 2017, American warplanes attacked a pro-Syrian government convoy that ignored warnings and violated a restricted zone around the base. The American-led international coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria flies combat air patrols over northeastern Syria to support about 500 American troops who carry out missions with Syrian Kurdish allies on the ground to counter pockets of ISIS fighters. The Mahan Air encounter came as Iran was already on edge after a series of mysterious explosions and violent attacks against its civilian and military infrastructure, including at a nuclear fuel enrichment complex in early July. Iranian officials have attributed some of the recent attacks to sabotage, though they have not said whether they suspect the United States. The encounter could amplify tensions between Iran and the United States, which is pursuing a hard-line campaign of sanctions and other actions against Iran that the Trump administration calls a “maximum pressure” strategy. Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, said Iran had contacted the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which protects American interests in Iran, to warn that the United States would be held accountable if anything happened to the Mahan Air flight, which later left Beirut empty to return to Iran. Mr. Mousavi said Iran’s mission to the United Nations had also conveyed this message to the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres. “We are investigating the details of this incident and after information is complete we will take necessary legal and political measures,” Mr. Mousavi said. A number of analysts said the Mahan Air episode appeared to fit a pattern of recent efforts to unnerve and destabilize Iran. “The timing of this incident is revealing,” said Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver. “It takes place against the backdrop of recent bombings in Iran that are widely attributed to Israel with the blessing of the U.S.A.” It remained far from clear, however, whether the warplane action was deliberate. Hesameddin Ashena, a senior adviser to President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on Twitter, “Those who love the lives of their leaders don’t play with the lives of our passengers.” While Iran and the United States have many longstanding grievances, for Iran one of the most potent remains the 1988 shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane by the Vincennes, an American warship that had been patrolling in the Persian Gulf. The plane, Iran Air Flight 655, carried 290 people. The United States later called it “a tragic and regrettable accident,” and subsequently paid millions to settle a lawsuit that Iran filed at the International Court of Justice.

"After Early Success, Israel’s Netanyahu Faces Fury for Flubbing Virus Fight",2020-07-24,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM —  For three nights this week thousands of young Israelis, provoked by what they see as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s flubbed response to the coronavirus scourge, shook off a long political slumber, blocked the streets outside his official residence and demanded that he quit. Many were not even of voting age when Mr.  Netanyahu  took office in Israel 11 years ago.  But their anger signaled that his storied political survival skills are confronting a new risk. “We have woken up,” read an enormous banner on a nearby building.  “We’ve learned that we have to look out for ourselves,” said Maayan Shrem, 25, a youth counselor and former combat soldier who came to Thursday night’s protest from his hometown, Karmiel, a two-hour bus ride from Jerusalem. Holding a placard that read “We will not cease to fight for our country,” his friend, Oren Gery, 26, added, “Change has to come from the bottom up.” While the fury reflects a multitude of grievances, they have converged around one man: a prime minister who is a defendant in a corruption trial is now blamed for a colossal failure in dealing with the health and economic crises caused by the virus pandemic, and is resorting to what critics call undemocratic measures to retain power. The public revolt signals yet another stunning turnaround for Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, who has managed to cling to his seat through three touch-and-go elections since April 2019. Above all, a prevailing sense of chaos pervades the government’s handling of the recent resurgence of the virus, prompting growing criticism even from the heart of Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party. “There’s a disconnect between the government and the public and the local authorities,” Haim Bibas, the Likud mayor of the central city of Modiin and the powerful chairman of the Federation of Local Authorities in Israel, said in an interview on Friday. The local authorities have been instrumental in battling the virus on the ground. “It feels as if there is no leadership and no governance,” said Mr. Bibas, who has run election campaigns for Mr. Netanyahu. Just two months ago, Mr. Netanyahu appeared to have outsmarted political adversaries for what seemed like the umpteenth time. He formed a national unity government with his main rival, the centrist Benny Gantz, neutralizing him as an opposition force. Praised for his initial success in handling the pandemic and with coronavirus wards closing for lack of patients, he abruptly opened up the economy in late May to try to resuscitate jobs and commerce, telling Israelis in a televised victory address to get some air, grab a coffee or a beer and, while taking the necessary precautions, to “Go out and have a good time.” An international survey published May 19 by the Israeli Keevoon research group and the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation found 67 percent of Israelis happy with his handling of the crisis, one of the top scores. Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party was soaring in the opinion polls. Within weeks, everything went awry. Daily infections rapidly spiked, from double-digit figures in May to about 2,000 per day now.  All children were sent back to school to finish the semester before summer break, which caused new outbreaks. The government zigzagged, sometimes within the space of a hot summer day, on policies regarding the opening and closing of restaurants, swimming pools and beaches, leaving Israelis bewildered. Nearly a million people were by now unemployed out of a population of nine million. Many self-employed Israelis whose businesses were wiped out had received pittances in state assistance or nothing at all. No clear plans had been made for a second wave of the virus. Now, some polls show only about a third of Israelis are satisfied with Mr. Netanyahu’s handling of the crisis. Instead of focusing on the economic distress, Mr. Netanyahu took time to obtain government approval for nine years of retroactive tax refunds on his personal expenses, worth more than $250,000. (He later apologized for the insensitive timing.) And he invested huge efforts in plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, an issue that few Israelis cared about. “Prime Minister Netanyahu turned all of his energies and clout toward the possible annexation at a time when millions of Israelis were concerned with the possible annexation of their own homes by their landlords and the banks because they can’t pay their rents and mortgages,” said Mitchell Barak, an Israeli pollster and director of Keevoon, the research group, who worked as an aide to Mr. Netanyahu in the 1990s. Adding to the tumult, a Jerusalem court decided this month that the next phase of Mr. Netanyahu’s trial will begin in January, with three hearings a week.  He has been charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Political analysts say that fear of a possible future Supreme Court ruling calling on him to suspend himself from office is driving Mr. Netanyahu to consider engineering a fourth election as early as November, in the hope of winning enough of a majority to grant him some immunity from prosecution. A budget dispute between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz could offer a pretext. Mr. Gantz is insisting on a two-year budget, in line with their coalition agreement, while Mr. Netanyahu is insisting on a single-year budget. Without an agreement by an Aug. 25 deadline Parliament will automatically disperse, sending an election-weary populace back to the ballot box three months later. “The question is who will blink first,” said Ayelet Frish, an Israeli political consultant.   The government, in the meantime, pushed through contentious legislation this week granting itself powers to decree emergency regulations to fight the coronavirus,  a measure that many critics have described as a perversion of the democratic process. In a sign of growing infighting and dysfunction, Israel Katz, the Likud finance minister, and Miki Zohar, the Likud whip and coalition chairman, publicly accused each other of advocating for the opening up of businesses owned by their relatives. Even a plan hastily announced by Mr. Netanyahu in mid-July to give every Israeli an immediate, one-time cash gift worth more than $200 backfired. Finance officials panned it as populist and unhelpful. Mr. Gantz insisted that the richest receive less than the poorest. Thousands of Israelis pledged to give their money to charity, accusing Mr. Netanyahu of trying to bribe protesters into submission. No payments have been made yet. Protests have swelled. Mr. Netanyahu has blamed Finance Ministry bureaucrats for the shambles in distributing assistance and has denounced the street protests as the work of leftists, a code word in right-wing circles for unpatriotic Israelis. “The cat is out of the bag,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote on Twitter after a Palestinian flag was briefly raised at one protest outside his official residence. The neighbors, including Mr. Netanyahu’s younger son, Avner, have complained about the noise. Police have dispersed the protests after midnight with water cannons. “I am here because I’ve had enough,” said Tzlil Levi, 28, a student of law and social work, at Thursday’s protest. She said she was no leftist. But, she added, “There’s no leadership. This is not about left or right. This is a political collapse.”']","With infections spiking again, young Israelis are protesting what they see as chaotic handling of the health and economic crisis."
"As the World Gets Tougher on China, Japan Tries to Thread a Needle",2020-07-25,By Motoko Rich and Makiko Inoue,"['TOKYO — Earlier this year, as it became clear that the coronavirus pandemic was not going to pass quickly, the Japanese government delayed plans for what would be the first state visit by a Chinese leader to Tokyo since 2008. Now, with Chinese military aggression rising in the region and Beijing cracking down on Hong Kong, Japan is considering canceling Xi Jinping’s visit altogether — but very gingerly. “We are not in the phase of arranging a concrete schedule now” was how Toshimitsu Motegi, the foreign minister, put it this month. While its top allies have taken a harder line on China — especially the United States, which dramatically escalated tensions this past week by closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston — Japan has pursued a delicate balancing act, mindful of the economic might of its largest trading partner and its own limited military options. So as Chinese ships have engaged in the longest series of incursions in or near Japanese waters in several years, Japan has offered a restrained response, vowing to be firm but “calm.” It did not join several Western nations in an initial statement criticizing the draconian security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong. It has abandoned plans to purchase an American missile defense system, which in part had been considered a shield against China. And the government has continued to tiptoe around the issue of the state visit by Mr. Xi, even as polls show that most Japanese believe it should be scrapped. “Certainly Japan is in a dilemma,” said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “We understand the fact that Japan is basically competing with China while cooperating with it. We are playing those two games at the same time.” For other world powers, this kind of middle ground on China, in the face of its growing authoritarianism and heightened bellicosity, has become less and less tenable. The United States has approved sanctions against Chinese companies and officials and pushed back on China’s broad territorial claims in the region’s seas. Australia led the call for a global inquiry into the origins of the pandemic, which began in China, and announced an investment of nearly $1 billion in cyberweapons and defenses to counter Beijing. Britain and Canada, along with Australia, have suspended extradition agreements with Hong Kong because of the national security law. China has responded by curbing Australian imports and threatening an array of retaliatory actions against any countries that move to punish it. On Friday, China responded to the closure of its Houston consulate by ordering the United States to shut its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu. To some extent, Japan’s mild-mannered response to China echoes its broader approach to foreign policy, in which it tends to avoid direct conflict or public rebukes of other nations. It has also sometimes sought a mediating role, as when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met last December with Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, to try to ease tensions in the Middle East. Not so long ago, China and Japan — the world’s second- and third-largest economies — were engaged in a diplomatic thaw as a hedge against an unpredictable Trump administration. In 2018, Mr. Abe became the first Japanese leader to visit China in seven years, and the two leaders pledged deeper economic and political cooperation. The invitation to Mr. Xi to visit Japan followed soon afterward. Now, given China’s muscle-flexing as the world is preoccupied with the pandemic, some have expressed disappointment that Japan has not rebuffed its neighbor more vigorously, such as by definitively canceling Mr. Xi’s visit. In recent weeks, China has engaged in deadly clashes on its border with India in the Himalayas, and it has sent ships for 100 straight days — the longest period in years of such incursions — to patrol waters around the Senkakus, islands administered by Japan but contested by China. Japan “should just say ‘we cannot have him if China continues with this sort of behavior,’” said Jeffrey Hornung, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, referring to Mr. Xi. But Mr. Hornung acknowledged that Tokyo would not want to draw China’s full ire, either. “If you look at what China is doing with India or Hong Kong, Japan doesn’t want to be at the tip of China’s spear right now,” Mr. Hornung said. “They know what they could do around the Senkakus in terms of swarming it with ships.” On Hong Kong, Japan did not join the United States, Australia, Canada and Britain in an initial statement criticizing the national security law. It subsequently led an effort to draft a statement by the foreign ministers of the Group of 7 countries expressing “grave concern” about the law, and Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party passed a resolution this month saying it could not “just remain on the sidelines seeing the situation” in Hong Kong. In response to the Chinese incursions in the East China Sea, Japan has mobilized Self-Defense Forces fighter jets to patrol the area. It continues, though, to use mild language in its protests to the Chinese government. Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Mr. Abe, told reporters that the Japanese government had “strongly requested” that Chinese ships “stop approaching Japanese fishing boats and quickly leave Japanese territory.” He added, “We would like to continue responding firmly in a calm manner.” Parts of the Japanese government have highlighted China’s growing hostility. Earlier this month, the defense ministry warned that China was trying to “alter the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea,” and it ranked China as a more serious long-term threat than North Korea. Yet Japan’s recent decision to abandon its plan to buy an American missile defense system, known as Aegis Ashore, led some to wonder if it would now be more exposed to potential attacks from both North Korea and China. The decision may have looked to some like a genuflection to Beijing. But soon afterward, the defense committee of the governing party discussed whether Japan could acquire weapons that would enable it to strike a missile launch site, if it detected signs of an imminent attack by a neighbor. Those discussions are in the early stages, and they would require extensive examination by constitutional experts to determine if such a capability would violate the pacifist clause in Japan’s Constitution. “While the cancellation of Aegis Ashore might put Japan in a more vulnerable position, if Japan uses this opportunity to pivot to acquisition of other capabilities, then the result could be even more worrying for China,” said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor in the department of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. One area where Japan has taken steps against China is the economy. Earlier this year, it passed a law restricting foreign investment in industries that the government designates as important to national security, a move that many viewed as targeting China. It has also offered financial incentives to companies — especially those in crucial sectors — to move operations out of China and into Japan or Southeast Asia. “The Chinese economy is recovering while other countries are still deteriorating,” said Takahide Kiuchi, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, a think tank. “Now China is in a good position to purchase companies in other countries, so the government is cautious about critical industries related to the military and national security.” Still, Japan does not want to push too hard. In addition to being Japan’s largest trading partner, China sent more tourists to Japan than any other nation before the pandemic shut borders. Last year, close to 115,000 Chinese students were studying at Japanese universities. The government, which has imposed entry bans on nearly 150 countries during the pandemic, is now discussing admitting travelers from several Asian countries, including China. “A couple of years ago, it seemed like there was space for Japan to be seen as a mediator because relations between the U.S. and China had become so bad,” Ms. Govella said. But with China’s increasing aggression, it “really is an actor that has different values and dubious intentions in the region,” she said. As China pursues this more belligerent policy, Japanese analysts say they hope that Beijing might learn from Japan’s own history and not try to expand its power too far, particularly by repressive means. China’s efforts to dominate the South China Sea, for example, are “one step toward kicking out the Western elements from their sphere of influence, which they have been dreaming of for the past century and a half,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat who is now teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. “Their nationalistic ambition will not end,” he said. “I am very concerned, and nobody can stop it, as they couldn’t stop us in Manchuria in the 1930s,” Mr. Miyake said, referring to Japan’s invasion of that region of eastern China. “At that time, the more pressure we had, the more adamant and arrogant and self-assertive we became, because we were too nationalistic and too undemocratic, and that was our destiny,” Mr. Miyake said. “China is following the same path.”']","Tokyo has not confronted Beijing as the United States and other allies have, mindful of its neighbor’s economic might and its own limited military options."

Prosecutors have said that rampant embezzlement by the Yoo family helped create unsafe conditions and practices on the Sewol ferry. Mr. Yoo, also\u200b known by his English name, Keith Yoo, is a son of Yoo Byung-eun, whose family controlled the Chonghaejin Marine Company, the operator of the Sewol. The overloaded ferry capsized off the southwestern tip of South Korea in April 2014\u200b in the country’s worst disaster in decades. Prosecutors later said that members of the Yoo family embezzled $169 million from a church that its patriarch \u200bhelped \u200bfound and from companies, including Chonghaejin, that were run with church funds and with loyal church members installed as business executives. By diverting money, which could have been used for safety measures, the family contributed to its sinking, prosecutors said. They \u200balso said that the ferry operator had routinely overloaded its ships, including the Sewol, in part to help make up for the losses incurred by the family’s embezzlement. On its last journey, the Sewol was carrying twice as much cargo as it was allowed. In a separate civil trial, a Seoul court in January ordered Mr. Yoo to pay $46 million in damages to the government but ruled that embezzlement was not a direct cause of the ship’s sinking. The investigation led South Korea to conduct its largest-ever manhunt for the family members. The senior Mr. Yoo was found dead. His eldest son, Yoo Dae-kyoon, spent two years in prison for illegally taking nearly $6.8 million since 2002 from seven companies controlled by his family, including the Chonghaejin company. Other relatives and company executives were also convicted on embezzlement and other criminal charges. The captain of the Sewol, who abandoned ship early in the crisis, is serving a life sentence for murder for his irresponsible handling of the disaster. But Yoo Hyuk-kee, the patriarch’s second son and once considered the likely heir to his father’s religious and business empire, had been elusive. He had previously been spotted in the United States, and was known to have \u200bowned property in Westchester County. The South Korean authorities asked the U.S. Justice Department for help in apprehending him for eventual extradition. Mr. Yoo was accused of conspiring with chief executives of the companies controlled by his family to defraud the businesses of $23 million through such sham contracts as “fraudulent” trademark licensing and business consulting agreements\u200b, Derek Wikstrom, an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, said in \u200bthe \u200bunsealed \u200bcomplaint \u200bagainst Mr. Yoo\u200b. Mr. Yoo was “the de facto leader of the church” and held a fifth of the holding company through which his family controlled businesses linked to the church, the complaint said. Mr. Yoo’s arrest on Wednesday was executed by the U.S. Marshals Service, Nicole Navas Oxman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said by email. On the same day, he appeared via videoconference in U.S. District Court in White Plains, N.Y., and remains in federal custody, she said. The Justice Department Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York are handling the extradition proceedings, she added. The Evangelical Baptist Church of Korea, which Mr. Yoo’s father helped found in the 1960s, was unaware of his arrest, Yi Tae-jong, a church spokesman, said on Thursday. Although Mr. Yoo had been an important preacher for its congregation, the church lost contact with him after he became a fugitive\u200b, Mr. Yi said\u200b. The South Korean Ministry of Justice confirmed Mr. Yoo’s arrest and said officials were cooperating with their American counterparts to hasten his extradition and ensure he was subject to “judicial justice.” Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul and Seamus Hughes from Washington.']","Yoo Hyuk-kee, whose family controlled a shipping company that ran a South Korean ferry that sank, faces charges of embezzlement.

Former Nazi Guard Is Convicted in One of Germany’s Last Holocaust Trials,2020-07-23,By Melissa Eddy,"['BERLIN — A German court convicted a 93-year-old man on Thursday for helping the Nazis murder thousands of people while he served as a concentration camp guard more than 75 years ago, in what might be one of the last verdicts to be handed down to a living participant in the Holocaust. The Hamburg state court found Bruno Dey guilty of 5,230 counts of accessory to murder — one for each person believed to have been killed in the Stutthof concentration camp, east of Gdansk in Poland, during the time he served as a guard there, from August 1944 to April 1945. Mr. Dey, who was tried in juvenile court because he was only 17 years old at the time, was given a two-year suspended sentence, reflecting the prosecutors’ acknowledgment of his contrition and willingness to cooperate with authorities. But survivors and those representing them criticized the sentence as too lenient. “It is unsatisfactory and much too late,” said Christoph Heubner of the International Auschwitz Committee, who followed the trial. “What is so upsetting for survivors is that this defendant failed to use the many postwar years of his life to reflect on what he saw and heard.” The trial against Mr. Dey was the latest in a push by prosecutors in the special office for handling Nazi-era crimes to bring aging suspects to justice before it is too late. And it came at a moment when the country is struggling to deal with a resurgence in right-wing extremism. Mr. Dey appeared at the Hamburg state court, seated in a wheelchair and wearing a blue surgical mask because of the coronavirus outbreak. He cast his eyes downward as the judge read his sentence, according to German public media. “You still see yourself as a mere observer, when in fact you were an accomplice to this man-made hell,” presiding judge Anne Meier-Goering told the defendant while reading the verdict. “You did not follow an order to carry out a crime and should not have inferred this.” In a closing statement, Mr. Dey said he felt it was important to express his thoughts and feelings about what he had learned during the trial, but also argued that he had been forced to serve as a concentration camp SS guard and was ordered into the position. “The witness testimony and the expert assessments made me realize the full scope of the horrors and suffering,” he told the court. “Today I would like to apologize for those who went through the hell of this insanity. Something like this must never happen again.” The German authorities have intensified their efforts in recent years to hold to account men and women, most of them now over 90, who played smaller roles in helping the Nazis round up and murder Europe’s Jews in their network of concentration and death camps. Throughout the Cold War, these people were overlooked by a justice system that demanded evidence of direct involvement of a Nazi-era crime in order to bring charges against a perpetrator. As the survivors grew older a reunited Germany began emphasizing the importance of remembrance and atonement, giving a prominent place to a Holocaust memorial in the heart of its new capital and establishing funds worth millions to compensate long overlooked victims of Nazi crimes. Over the past decades, the courts, too, have shifted their perspective, following landmark rulings in 2011 and 2015 that established that individuals who played supporting roles in Nazi crimes could be convicted on the argument of association. Last week, another former guard from Stutthof, age 95, was charged with similar crimes. Because Mr. Dey was only 17 when he began his guard duties, he was tried as a juvenile. Prosecutors had sought a three-year prison sentence for his role at the camp, where he was tasked with making sure that none of the inmates, mostly Polish Jews and political prisoners, escaped. More than 60,000 people — roughly half of whom were Jews — are believed to have died or been killed at the camp, which was the first to be established by the Nazi regime outside of Germany’s borders. Located in the small Polish town of Sztutowo, it served as a prison camp after the invasion of Poland in 1939. Gas chambers were put into use in 1944, and the camp was one of the last to be liberated. More than three dozen survivors testified in the trial, which began in October. They told the court of seeing relatives die in the electric fences that surrounded the Stutthof camp, collecting the bones of other victims and being chased from their barracks, naked in subzero temperatures. Mr. Dey acknowledged hearing screams from the camp’s gas chambers and watching as corpses were taken to be burned. But he said he never fired his weapon and that the “images of misery and horror have haunted me my entire life.” For Mr. Heubner, of the International Auschwitz Committee, who volunteered at Stutthof during the 1970s and attended several sessions of Mr. Dey’s trial as an observer, the statement rang hollow. “The image of him sitting above the camp in his tower is reflective of the view he had of himself as above those who were suffering,” he said. “And although he had decades to confront the horrors of what he witnessed, he remained silent.” Stefan Waterkamp, Mr. Dey’s attorney, argued for his client to be acquitted. He said Mr. Dey did not become a guard by choice and that trying to flee or resist duty would have put him in danger. “How could an 18-year-old step out of line in a situation like this?” Mr. Waterkamp said as part of his closing argument. Judge Meier-Goering said the lesson of the trial must be to “honor human dignity at all costs — even when the price is your own safety.” Germany continues to struggle with this maxim, as far-right activity has surged in the country in the past year. Earlier this week, a different German court opened a trial against a 28-year-old German suspected of plotting to blast his way into a synagogue filled with Jews observing Yom Kippur an attack that failed but left two people dead and injured several others. The attack was the most severe of thousands of crimes committed against Jews in Germany in 2019 — the worst year since the country started tracking them in 2001. Prosecutors said the defendant in that trial, Stephan Balliet, had been motivated by a belief that “the root of all these problems is the Jew.”']","The 93-year-old defendant was convicted of 5,230 counts of accessory to murder — one for each person’s death while he was at the Stutthof camp — but was tried in juvenile court, because he was 17 at the time."
Thailand Drops All Charges Against Red Bull Heir in Deadly Crash,2020-07-24,By Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono,"['BANGKOK — The police in Thailand said they had dropped the last remaining charges against a wealthy playboy on Friday, eight years after he struck and killed an officer with his Ferrari and fled the country. The announcement ended a yearslong drama that included the issuance of an international arrest warrant for the heir to one of the country’s most storied companies and largest fortunes and a public outcry over the seemingly separate system of justice for the country’s richest people. Just before dawn on a dark Bangkok street on a September night in 2012, a speeding Ferrari struck and killed a motorcycle police officer. The driver fled the scene, but a trail of leaking engine fluid led the police to his door — and the damaged Ferrari — a short distance away. The police arrested the driver, Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, the grandson of the inventor of the Red Bull energy drink and heir to one of Thailand’s greatest fortunes. The police said at the time that he had been intoxicated and admitted that his car hit the officer, Wichean Glanprasert. But in a case often cited as an example of the special treatment received by Thailand’s elite, Mr. Vorayuth was never brought to justice. He fled the country and has been living in luxury for years. On Friday, the police said they were dropping the last charge in the case, reckless driving resulting in someone’s death, and were withdrawing Thai and Interpol warrants for his arrest. A police spokesman, Col. Krisana Pattanajaroen, said the police had followed all proper procedures in the case. “It’s quite normal,” he said. “We strictly followed the protocol here.” The process of withdrawing the arrest warrants will be completed soon and Mr. Vorayuth, 37, who goes by nickname “Boss,” will be able to return to Thailand if he wishes. “After that, he’ll be free,” Colonel Krisana said. During the investigation, Mr. Vorayuth repeatedly ignored police summonses. He fled the country in 2017, shortly before the first arrest warrant was issued. Three charges — speeding, hit-and-run driving and reckless driving causing damage to another person — were dropped earlier because the statute of limitations had expired. Soon after the crash, Mr. Vorayuth’s family paid the police officer’s family nearly $100,000 in compensation and Mr. Vorayuth resumed his jet-set lifestyle, traveling around the world on private Red Bull jets, keeping a Porsche in London and staying in luxury hotels. Prosecutors decided to close the case last month, but news of the decision did not surface until this week. In a June 18 letter to Mr. Vorayuth, a police deputy director of investigations, Lt. Col. Thanawut Sanguansuk, informed him of the decision. “This case is therefore terminated in accordance with the legal process,” the letter said. The outcome was what the family of Mr. Wichean, the motorcycle officer, expected long ago. Mr. Vorayuth “is powerful, has many connections and a lot of money,” the officer’s older brother, Pornanand Glanprasert, said in a 2013 interview. “If you are common people like us, I think the case is already finished,” he said. “He is going to try very hard not to be charged — or at the very least to get a suspended sentence or no punishment at all.”']","Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, grandson of the energy drinks inventor, had fled the country after striking a police officer with his car in Bangkok in 2012."
These Monkeys Were Once Revered. Now They Are Taking Over.,2020-07-25,By Hannah Beech,"['LOPBURI, Thailand — The customers waiting outside a bank in Lopburi, Thailand, left their jewelry at home and kept other treasures out of sight. But danger lurked anyway. In broad daylight, they watched a thief steal an iced tea and a vandal brazenly attack a motorcycle seat. One woman quit her place in the line, when a stalker crept up and threatened to bite her. With a sigh, a police officer brandished a slingshot, and the monkeys scattered. Less than a minute later, they were back. Lopburi, a onetime capital of a Siamese kingdom and a repository of ancient architecture, is a city under siege. Crab-eating macaques, a Southeast Asian species with piercing eyes and curious natures, have spilled out of the temples where they were once revered and taken over the heart of the old town. Their growing population, at least 8,400 in the area with most concentrated in a few city blocks, has decimated parts of the local economy. With territorial troupes of macaques roaming the neighborhood, dozens of businesses — including a music school, gold shop, barber, cellphone store and movie theater — have been forced to close in recent years. The coronavirus pandemic has added to the chaos. The frolicking monkeys drew droves of tourists as well as Buddhist faithful, who believe feeding the animals is a meritorious deed. Their favorite offerings included coconut yogurt, strawberry soda and brightly colored snack packs. Now the macaques don’t understand where that source of sustenance has gone. And they are hungry. Over the years, the monkeys moved into abandoned buildings, trashing display cases and rattling the bars installed to keep them out. Unless security guards are vigilant, they rip antennas and windshield wipers off parked cars. Dangling earrings, sunglasses and plastic bags that look like they may have food in them are irresistible to the monkeys. And in the areas of the city most densely packed with the animals, many residents live in fear of the next sneak attack. But in a Buddhist-majority culture in which culling monkeys would disturb spiritual sensibilities, local officials and residents have few options to fend off the gangs of macaques. Besides, in the past, the monkeys drew tourists to Lopburi. Without them, the economy might suffer even more. At a hardware store across the street from the ruins of a 13th-century Hindu temple, oversized stuffed animals in the shape of crocodiles and tigers peer out at the street where the monkey traffic outpaces that of pedestrians. The plush toys were meant to scare away the monkeys and it worked for a couple months. But the macaques soon figured out that they weren’t real, said Yupa Srisanguan, the shop owner. “It has never been this bad,” Ms. Yupa said, as a young male macaque wandered into her store, intent on chewing the loops of rubber hose hanging from the ceiling. “We’re not against the monkeys, but it’s difficult when people are afraid of being bitten when they come to our store.” When she was a little girl, Ms. Yupa, 70, said, the monkeys were fewer, bigger and healthier, their fur shiny and thick. They kept to the temples, as well as the ruins of the ancient Khmer civilization that once held sway over this part of central Thailand. But with an influx of monkey-enchanted visitors, some foreign, came an easy and often unhealthy font of food. Along with bananas and citrus, the macaques feasted on junk. Their fur thinned. Some went bald. Without having to worry about their next meal, the monkeys, which can give birth twice a year, had more time for other pursuits. The population exploded. Compared with the monkeys of the forest, their urban counterparts have less muscle and are more susceptible to hypertension and blood disease, said Narongporn Doodduem, the director of a regional office of the Wildlife Conservation Department. “The monkeys are never hungry,” he said, “just like children who eat too much KFC.” As traffic recently piled up at a light in old town Lopburi, Nirad Pholngeun, a police officer, kept his slingshot at the ready. He has been stationed at this street corner for five years and has watched the growing monkey population with alarm. A truck, presumably from out of town, idled at the light, its flatbed filled with crates of fruit for the market. A monkey spotted the produce, wove through the traffic, leapt onto the truck and held aloft a juicy dragon fruit. The one expeditionary macaque drew dozens more. By the time the light turned green, the crates were cleared and the gorging began. Throughout the mayhem, Mr. Nirad raised his slingshot but there was little a police officer could do against so many macaques. His battle tactic was a charade anyway. The slingshot held no projectiles. “It’s hopeless,” he said. “Within a blink of an eye there are more monkeys. So many babies.” Local wildlife officials have begun sterilizing the monkeys en masse to control their numbers. More than 300 animals underwent surgery last month, and 200 more will be sterilized in August. Capturing the monkeys for the operations is a major undertaking, said Mr. Narongporn, the wildlife official. On the first day of the June campaign, the monkey catchers wore camouflage-printed uniforms and lured the animals into cages with food. But by the second day, the monkeys knew to avoid them. The monkey catchers had to switch to wearing shorts and floral shirts, pretending they were holidaymakers. “The monkeys are smart,” Mr. Narongporn said. “They remember.” With the coronavirus dissuading many tourists and Buddhist pilgrims from visiting Lopburi, local residents have taken to feeding the monkeys themselves. “We can’t let them starve,” said Itiphat Tansitikulphati, the owner of the Muang Thong Hotel. Every day, an old female monkey calls on his hotel, waiting politely for her meal to be served. Banana cake is her favorite, but plain fruit will do, too. “A long time ago, a lot of Lopburi was forest so we are taking the land from the monkeys,” Mr. Itiphat said. A third generation hotelier, he has relinquished the top floor to the monkeys, who have wrecked it with the zeal of drunken partygoers, ripping up wooden planks and shredding corrugated metal. An electric fence protects the ground floor of the hotel. But even before the coronavirus hit, visitors, many of whom were traveling businesspeople, were scared off by the marauding monkeys, Mr. Itiphat said. His hotel barely survives. “The balance between humans and monkeys is off,” he said. “It hurts business.” Nearby, Patiphan Tantiwong runs a general store on the main street of Lopburi. He has given in to the macaques. A plump male sat on bags of dog food, sipping a yogurt drink. A clutch of youngsters swarmed a counter waiting for handouts of cookies. There were monkeys among the piles of batteries and monkeys among the light bulbs. The babies squeaked and played a form of macaque peekaboo. “The monkeys were here before us,” Mr. Patiphan said, as a juvenile tugged on the hem of his trousers demanding a treat. “We have to adapt to them, not the other way around.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.']","The monkeys of Lopburi, Thailand, were once a draw for tourists and pilgrims who would feed them. But with few recent visitors, the monkeys are getting hungry — and aggressive."
"A Saudi Spy Chief Hid Abroad. With Appeals and Threats, M.B.S. Tried to Bring Him Back",2020-07-24,By Ben Hubbard,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — As Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia sidelined rivals to consolidate power a few years ago, a former Saudi intelligence official feared that he would end up in the prince’s sights and slipped out of the kingdom. The prince has been trying to get him back since, first asking the former official, Saad Aljabri, to come home for a new job, then trying unsuccessfully to have him extradited on corruption charges through Interpol, according to text messages and legal documents reviewed by The New York Times. “You are involved in many large cases of corruption that have been proven,” Prince Mohammed wrote to the former official in September 2017. “There is no state in the world that would refuse to turn you over.” But Interpol questioned the Saudi commitment to due process and human rights in the kingdom’s handling of corruption cases and deemed the Saudi request for Mr. Aljabri politically motivated, a violation of the organization’s rules, according to Interpol documents. So it removed Mr. Aljabri’s name from its system. The text messages and documents reviewed by The Times, which have not been previously reported, shed new light on how far Prince Mohammed has reached to exert control over Saudis he fears could subvert him. The struggle has accelerated this year. In March, Saudi Arabia detained two of Mr. Aljabri’s adult children and his brother, prompting accusations by relatives and United States officials that they were being held hostage to secure Mr. Aljabri’s return.  And last week, the kingdom’s state-controlled news media seized upon an article in the The Wall Street Journal that cited unidentified Saudi officials accusing Mr. Aljabri of misspending billions of dollars in state funds to enrich himself and relatives. One Saudi newspaper published a wanted poster with Mr. Aljabri’s face on it, part of an apparent effort to tarnish his reputation in the kingdom. The revelations come amid concerns about the health of Prince Mohammed’s father, King Salman, whose death could put the prince in charge of Saudi Arabia for decades. The king, 84, was hospitalized over the weekend and underwent successful gall bladder surgery, Saudi state media reported Thursday. Since his father became king in 2015, Prince Mohammed, 34, has taken charge of military, economic and social policies while targeting critics and foes with travel bans, detentions and lawsuits. These increasingly authoritarian tactics caught global attention when Saudi agents killed Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident Saudi writer, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, bringing widespread condemnation. The Saudi moves against Mr. Aljabri have drawn attention in Washington, where many officials considered him a valuable intelligence partner. In a letter to President Trump this month, four senators referred to Mr. Aljabri as “a close U.S. ally and friend” and said the United States had “a moral obligation to do what it can to assist in securing his children’s freedom.” Officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment about the text messages between Prince Mohammed and Mr. Aljabri, the Saudi Interpol request or the kingdom’s corruption allegations. The Times reviewed scores of text messages between the two men provided by a law firm working for Mr. Aljabri, Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, and Interpol documents informing Mr. Aljabri of its decision about the Saudi request against him. Mr. Aljabri’s rise and fall were tied to his association with Prince Mohammed’s primary rival for the Saudi throne, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who headed the Interior Ministry and became crown prince in 2015. A linguist with a doctorate in artificial intelligence, Mr. Aljabri became a top official at the ministry, which handles security and counterterrorism, putting him in regular contact with U.S. diplomats and officials from the Central Intelligence Agency. Many have praised his professionalism. “Aljabri is really smart, and he has encyclopedic knowledge,” said Douglas London, a former officer in the C.I.A.’s Clandestine Service and nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “He lived up to his word, he did not over-promise and he delivered.” But Mr. Aljabri’s star fell as Prince Mohammed’s rose. Mr. Aljabri was dismissed by royal decree in 2015. In 2017, Mr. Aljabri began to fear that Prince Mohammed intended to replace Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince and target his domestic allies, so Mr. Aljabri left the kingdom, settling in Turkey. On June 18 of that year, Prince Mohammed texted him, asking Mr. Aljabri to return to help solve an unspecified issue with Mohammed bin Nayef, according to translated versions of texts provided by Mr. Aljabri’s law firm. “I want to explain to you what has happened recently and come to an agreement with you about a strategy to solve all these difficulties,” Prince Mohammed wrote. Mr. Aljabri replied that he was “prepared to accept whatever you command.” Prince Mohammed said he wanted the three men to meet so they could “reconcile and everything can return to the way it was.” On June 20, Mr. Aljabri said he could not return to Saudi Arabia immediately because of medical treatment. Prince Mohammed said he had only summoned him because he was “in dire need of your assistance.” The next day, however, Prince Mohammed ousted Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince and took his place. Mohammed bin Nayef was placed under house arrest, and two of Mr. Aljabri’s children, Sarah, who was 17 at the time, and Omar, who was 18, were barred from leaving Saudi Arabia. Mr. Aljabri wrote to pledge allegiance to Prince Mohammed as crown prince, and Prince Mohammed encouraged him to return for an important new job. “When you return safely, I will explain to you the background to the problem,” Prince Mohammed wrote. “I will still need you to deal with anyone who attempts to create disorder and conflict.” Mr. Aljabri asked Prince Mohammed to lift the travel ban on his children. Prince Mohammed did not respond. Three months later, Mr. Aljabri asked Prince Mohammed again to lift the travel ban “to allow them to leave so that they may finish their studies.” “When I see you, I will explain to you the background,” Prince Mohammed responded. Mr. Aljabri repeated his request. “When I see you, I will explain everything to you,” Prince Mohammed wrote. A few days later, Prince Mohammed asked Mr. Aljabri to return to Saudi Arabia the next day, linking his return to the travel ban on Mr. Aljabri’s children. “I want to resolve this problem of your son and daughter, but this is a very sensitive file here” related to Mohammed bin Nayef, Prince Mohammed wrote. “I want your opinion about it as well as information from you concerning it. I also want to come to an understanding with you regarding your future situation and what the details should be.” Soon after, Prince Mohammed texted again, this time threatening to have Mr. Aljabri arrested abroad. With the danger now clear, Mr. Aljabri moved from Turkey to Canada, according to his son, Khalid Aljabri, a cardiologist also based in Canada. To try to force him home, the Saudi authorities filed a notice with Interpol, the international police organization, asking other nations to help with Mr. Aljabri’s extradition, according to Interpol documents. But instead of filing for a Red Notice, which acts like an international arrest warrant, the Saudis filed a diffusion, which Interpol describes as a less formal way for Interpol members to request help from other nations. Mr. Aljabri confirmed that his name was in the Interpol system in December 2017, when his wife and other relatives were barred from flying from Turkey to Canada because their party contained another Saad Aljabri: Mr. Aljabri’s infant grandson and namesake, Dr. Aljabri said. The family nonetheless managed to get to Canada via the United States and appealed the inclusion of Mr. Aljabri’s name in the Interpol system. They won in July 2018, according to an Interpol document about the decision. It did not detail the charges Saudi Arabia had made against Mr. Aljabri or any evidence the kingdom had provided.  But in rejecting the Saudi request, the commission criticized the kingdom’s previous handling of corruption cases for “the lack of due process and human rights guarantees.” The commission cited Prince Mohammed’s crackdown in 2017, when hundreds of the kingdom’s richest and most prominent businessmen were locked in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton and accused of corruption. Many were abused and at least one died from mistreatment, medics and associates of the detainees said. The Interpol commission wrote that the anti-corruption committee that oversaw that crackdown was “part of a political strategy by MBS to target any potential political rival or opposition.” The kingdom soon found other ways to pressure Mr. Aljabri. In March, his two adult children who had been barred from leaving the kingdom were arrested in their Riyadh home. In May, Mr. Aljabri’s brother was arrested. None have contacted their relatives since, Dr. Aljabri said. “The Saudi royal family is holding Sarah and Omar Aljabri as hostages,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont wrote on Twitter this month with the letter from him and three other senators to Mr. Trump. “For a government to use such tactics is abhorrent. They should be released immediately.”']","To try to force a former Saudi intelligence officer to return to the kingdom, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked for his help, targeted his family and sought to have him arrested abroad."
A Chinese Tycoon Denounced Xi Jinping. Now He Faces Prosecution,2020-07-24,By Javier C. Hernández,"['China’s ruling Communist Party has expelled an outspoken and prominent property tycoon who denounced the country’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, paving the way for his criminal prosecution and escalating its efforts to quash dissent among the elite. The party announced the expulsion of the tycoon, Ren Zhiqiang, late Thursday, and said that it had seized his assets for “serious violations of discipline and law” that included the possession of golf club memberships. Officials also took aim at Mr. Ren’s family, accusing him of “colluding with his children to accumulate wealth without restraint.” The moves against Mr. Ren, 69, appeared designed to send a chill over the country’s entrepreneurs and other business leaders and demonstrate the party’s resolve to use him as an example to show that no one was above its demands of unflinching political loyalty. He was accused of “smearing the party and country’s image, distorting the party and the military’s history, being disloyal and dishonest with the party” and of resisting the party’s investigation into him — phrasing that suggests he has refused to admit any wrongdoing. Mr. Ren, a veteran party member and former chairman of Huayuan Properties, a real estate development company, was detained in March after criticizing Mr. Xi’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. He is likely to face criminal charges in China’s opaque and often- unforgiving legal system. Mr. Ren’s friends said that the party’s harsh treatment of Mr. Ren was excessive. “This is blatant political persecution,” Wang Ying, a retired entrepreneur and friend of Mr. Ren’s, said in a post on WeChat, a popular messaging app. “This is a rare good man, a good citizen who is responsible and ready to take responsibility, an entrepreneur who played his role and followed the law.” “I’m proud to have a friend like you,” Ms. Wang wrote. Under Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, the Chinese authorities have investigated or detained scores of lawyers, journalists and scholars who have challenged the party line, often on spurious charges. The crackdown has intensified in recent months, as the party has come under intense criticism for its handling of the coronavirus, its imposition of new national security laws in Hong Kong and the ongoing crackdown on Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang. “Xi has zero tolerance for political dissent, let alone any leeway for being openly mocked,” said Jude Blanchette, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research institute based in Washington, D.C. “From Hong Kong to Xinjiang, it’s clear that Xi and the party will close the fist when they sense a security or political challenge to their core rule, international outcry be damned.” As Chinese business executives have attracted devoted followings in recent years, the party has worked more aggressively to bring them under its control. China depends on entrepreneurs for innovations that drive its economy, but officials also worry their celebrity could pose a threat to the party’s dominance. Mr. Xi told a meeting of entrepreneurs in Beijing on Tuesday that one of their most important aims should be to “enhance their patriotism.” “Patriotism is the glorious tradition of our country’s outstanding entrepreneurs in modern times,” he said, according to a transcript published by Xinhua, the official news agency. Mr. Ren, a bold commentator who earned the nickname “The Cannon,” went missing in March after writing an essay criticizing the party’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December. In the essay, Mr. Ren said the party’s strict limits on free speech, including the silencing of whistle blowers, had exacerbated the crisis. At one point, he referred obliquely to Mr. Xi, who has tried to craft an image as a commanding, transformative leader, as a power-hungry “clown.” “I see not an emperor standing there exhibiting his ‘new clothes,’ but a clown who stripped naked and insisted on continuing to be an emperor,” Mr. Ren wrote. He said he hoped the party would “wake up from ignorance” and oust the leaders getting in its way. The party discipline committee in Beijing on Thursday pointed to Mr. Ren’s writings in outlining his alleged misdeeds. Party officials also accused Mr. Ren of using public funds to pay for private expenses, setting the stage for corruption and embezzlement charges. Those expenses included golf club membership cards, the announcement said. The party has long used golf to conjure up images of luxury and excess; Mao once called it a “sport for millionaires.” The announcement said the party was seizing Mr. Ren’s “illegal gains” and transferring his case to prosecutors. It accused him of “using public power as a tool for personal gain.” It is not the first time that Mr. Ren has faced punishment for criticizing Mr. Xi. In 2016, the party placed him on a year’s probation for denouncing Mr. Xi’s propaganda policies in comments online and shut down his social media accounts, where he had attracted tens of millions of followers. Mr. Ren, the former leader of a state-run company and a friend to influential Chinese politicians, is a well-known member of the establishment who joined the Communist Party when he was 23. His expulsion highlights fears within the party that any criticism from its own members could undermine its grip on power, activists say. “Ren Zhiqiang is not a radical dissident, but a decades-long loyal Communist Party member who advocated for political reform,” said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Communist Party has no tolerance of any kind of criticism towards the party, even if it is made with the intention to improve the party’s governance.” The party has in recent months detained several other prominent figures who have criticized Mr. Xi’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Xu Zhangrun, a law professor who had repeatedly denounced Mr. Xi’s authoritarian policies, was briefly detained this month after writing essays blaming officials for delays and obfuscation in the early days of the epidemic. The police accused Mr. Xu of consorting with prostitutes, a charge his friends said was untrue and used as a slur to discredit him. He has since been dismissed from his teaching position at Tsinghua University in Beijing, friends say. Xu Zhiyong, a legal activist, was detained in February, activists say, after accusing Mr. Xi of trying to conceal the coronavirus and calling on him to step down. He was formally arrested last month. As Mr. Xi, one of China’s most powerful leaders in decades, looks to further strengthen his rule amid the coronavirus crisis, he is most likely worried about threats to his leadership within elite political and business circles, analysts say. Erin Baggott Carter, assistant professor at the School of International Relations at the University of Southern California, said Mr. Ren’s expulsion is “a warning to other C.C.P. elites to toe the line,” referring to the Chinese Communist Party. She said Mr. Xi’s popularity among elites and the broader public could be suffering amid a series of challenges, including unemployment and tensions with the United States. “He cannot tolerate dissent, particularly from powerful elites with public support,” she said, referring to Mr. Xi. “These elites could most challenge his leadership.”']","The party accused Ren Zhiqiang, an influential property tycoon who criticized Xi Jinping, of being disloyal, took aim at his children and paved the way for criminal prosecution."
"Beijing’s Tightrope: Stand Tough, but Avoid a Full Rupture With the U.S.",2020-07-23,By Keith Bradsher and Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — Two weeks ago, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, pleaded with the United States to step back from the brink and find ways to work together. Just days later, he complained to his Russian counterpart that the United States had “lost its mind, morals and credibility.” The question now is what China can do about it. The Trump administration’s broad assault on China has left its leadership with few options that would not threaten a complete breach in relations. If that happened, it could leave Beijing even more isolated at a time when China is also clashing with India, Britain, Canada, Australia and many other countries. It could also hurt the Chinese economy when it is already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and the global fallout. The order on Tuesday to close the Chinese Consulate in Houston with only 72 hours’ notice was only the latest action by the administration that has infuriated officials in China. In a matter of weeks, Beijing has endured a stepped-up campaign against its 5G wireless technology, sanctions against officials overseeing Hong Kong and the largely Muslim region of Xinjiang, and now accusations that China has dispatched scores of soldiers under cover to steal commercial, military and even medical secrets. A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry vowed again on Thursday that the government would retaliate in kind to the closure. He dismissed the administration’s accusations as “a malicious smearing.” On Friday, Beijing hit back, telling the United States it must shut down its consulate in Chengdu, the westernmost of the five American consulates in mainland China. The furor is inflaming anti-American sentiment in China and emboldening more hawkish voices. Nationalists are calling for China to go further than a measured tit-for-tat response and even consider shutting down the American Consulate in Hong Kong. “Let them sweat,” Hu Xijin, the editor of The Global Times, a nationalist Communist Party newspaper, wrote of American diplomats in the embassy and six consulates. He said the mission in Hong Kong was “obviously” an intelligence center, while vastly exaggerating the size of the staff. He then referred to the frantic reaction to the closure at the Houston consulate, where people could be seen in a courtyard burning documents in metal bins. “Have each of their consulates make an emergency plan, pack up all the files and prepare to burn.” Behind the scenes, senior Chinese officials seem to have little desire to escalate the tensions even further, concerned that any moves could play into President Trump’s hands as he mounts his re-election campaign. A highly visible showdown with China could distract Americans from Mr. Trump’s botched response to the pandemic and allow him to campaign as a leader who is defending his country against a foreign power. “This is a classic game, to find an external distraction and rouse the people behind the president,” said Lau Siu-kai, a senior Beijing adviser on Hong Kong issues. At the same time, Beijing cannot afford to appear weak in the face of the barrage of attacks from the United States. A rising sense of national pride, instilled by the country’s schools and amplified by state media, demands that Chinese leaders stand strong when challenged from abroad. “China needs to protect its own honor and sovereignty,” said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai. Wang Wenbin, the foreign ministry’s spokesman, made clear at the ministry’s daily briefing on Thursday that Chinese officials were acutely aware of their dilemma. “We are not interested in interfering in the U.S. election; we also hope that the U.S. side will not play the China card in the election,” he said, while immediately cautioning the Trump administration as well. “We advise the U.S. side not to make mistakes again and again, otherwise China will certainly make a legitimate and necessary response.” Rising tensions with Washington have laid bare divisions in Beijing over how to respond to a confrontation that has become even broader and more aggressive than Chinese officials expected only weeks ago. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, delivering a speech Thursday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in California, said the Trump administration would persist in challenging China around the globe. He did not mention any issues of common interest or grounds for constructive engagement. “General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology,” Mr. Pompeo said, referring to the Chinese leader. He added, “I call on every leader of every nation to start by doing what America has done — to simply insist on reciprocity, to insist on transparency, and on accountability from the Chinese Communist Party.” On one side are officials in the country’s security services and the military who oppose any conciliatory stance that might be interpreted by the United States as weakness, according to several people involved in Chinese policymaking who spoke on the condition of anonymity, given the diplomatic sensitivities. Other officials, generally those focused on the economy, have sought a more measured response to the American actions — keeping the trade truce intact, for example. Even after the closing of the Houston consulate, China remains committed to the so-called Phase 1 trade agreement with the United States signed on Jan. 15, the people familiar with Chinese policymaking said. If China wanted to hurt Mr. Trump in the election campaign, Beijing could halt the large purchases of American food that it agreed to make as part of the trade truce negotiated before the pandemic broke out. That would penalize American farmers, who could prove an important voting bloc in some states. So far, China has kept buying large quantities of American corn, wheat, sorghum and pork this summer, said Darin Friedrichs, an agricultural commodities specialist in the Shanghai office of INTL FCStone, a large Chicago trading firm. Less than two weeks ago, China made its largest single purchase ever of American corn, just four days after another major transaction. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, remains the ultimate arbiter of the policy debate in Beijing, but has not spoken out on the deterioration in relations. On Wednesday, when the closing of the consulate became public, he toured distant Jilin Province, seemingly undisturbed by the diplomatic confrontation. On Thursday, he visited the Air Force Aviation University, talking instead about China’s national celebration of its military in August. “Beijing’s policy has always been adjusted by Xi himself,” said Wu Qiang, an independent analyst in Beijing. “He steps on the gas himself and then hits the brake himself.” The Chinese appear to have been taken aback by the sharp deterioration in relations. In a speech on July 9, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, appeared to outline a path for stabilizing relations. “President Xi Jinping has underlined on many occasions that we have a thousand reasons to make the China-U.S. relationship a success, and none whatsoever to wreck it,” he said. “As long as both sides have the positive will to improve and grow this relationship, we will find ways to steer this relationship out of the difficulties and bring it back to the right track.” Instead, the Chinese faced confrontation on a multitude of new fronts. In the latest salvo over the consulate, the Trump administration accused Chinese diplomats of aiding economic espionage and the attempted theft of scientific research in numerous cases across the United States. Chinese officials angrily denounced the closure of the consulate, calling it a provocation that would further undermine already soured relations. Cai Wei, China’s top diplomat in Houston, said the move against the consulate, the first Beijing opened in the United States after re-establishing ties in 1979, was “very damaging.” In previous tense moments, the two leaders, Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, sometimes smoothed over differences with a long phone call or a meeting. It has happened in the past when trade fights boiled over, as well as early in the coronavirus outbreak, when the rhetoric between both sides intensified. The tone now in Washington, though, has worsened. And Mr. Trump no longer seems interested in defusing the crisis. “Xi Jinping could take the initiative instead,” said Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. “Xi could also demonstrate China’s benign intentions by inviting the U.S. to join with it in leading an international effort to plan now for the testing, manufacture and fair distribution of Covid vaccine.” The tough policies and tougher rhetoric from Washington indicate that the United States, not China, is setting the ever more confrontational tone in the bilateral relationship. “I think originally you could have faulted the Chinese for much of the imbalance,” said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society, “but now the U.S. doesn’t seem as ardent about leaving the door open for remedy, as it is arching its back against China.” Given the breadth of American actions and increasingly bipartisan support, it is not clear that China can hope for an improvement even if Mr. Trump’s challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., wins the election. Mr. Schell noted that as vice president, Mr. Biden met with Mr. Xi frequently, even traveling together. “There’s a kind of symmetry there that he could use to recast the relationship,” he said. “The real question is whether Xi can respond the same way — whether giving a little to get a little is seen as weakness.” “I do think that Biden and his people are perfectly capable of working out a new balance point,” he added. “I have much less confidence that China will find that easy to do.” Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul, South Korea.

"Divisions, Decency and ‘The Plague’",2020-07-24,By Damien Cave,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. There’s a point early on in “The Plague” when a journalist stuck in the sickened city of Oran tries desperately to get out — beyond the walls, to the rest of healthy, happy French Algeria. It’s meant to be for love. Raymond Rambert, the would-be escapee in Albert Camus’s 1947 novel, is eager to reach the woman he intends to marry. But I found myself recalling the scene last week because it reminded me of the divide that pandemics create between places and people, and the enormous difference between life inside with the contagion and life beyond, in someplace that feels almost normal. At the time, I was catching up on news of the surging coronavirus outbreak in Victoria while enjoying a gourmet lunch in northern New South Wales after stopping at a busy local bookstore. It felt odd and, if I’m honest, exhilarating, to be enjoying such luxuries. The tables in the restaurant, Shelter in Lennox Head, were far enough apart to feel safe but not so distant to feel abnormal. The food was great. The bookstore, too, felt almost pre-pandemic. Our family of four felt as though we had escaped to the other side, and in many ways we had, especially compared to our loved ones in the United States. I recently talked to a friend in South Carolina who told me he had been in isolation for 110 days and spoken to only five people in that time who were not members of his family. And yet, even for the lucky ones, it all feels so fragile. The difference between the imaginary world of Camus and our very real world today is that the virus is not — and may never be — truly contained. Our societies are porous. Our lives are networked and global. So in the bookstore, the clerk, when she heard our American accents, told us that she had Australian friends who were forced to leave the U.S. because the Trump administration — its anti-immigration urges empowered by the pandemic — had canceled their visas. At the restaurant, one of the owners told me that while they were doing well there, he had to close another restaurant he had opened only recently. “The places that are not well established, they’re not going to make it,” he said. Another divide, another wall: between the businesses that survive and those that do not; between those with work and those without. What should we do and how should we feel about the uneven distribution of pandemic consequences? This, it seems to me, is a question that we’ll be grappling with for a while. The Australian government’s adjustments to the JobKeeper program this week, extending wage subsidies into next year but curtailing the amounts, signals that officials have begun to recognize what it took the residents of Oran a long time to accept — that pestilence requires endurance. Here’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison: “The virus will plot its own course.” Here’s Camus: “The preceding months, though they had increased the desire for liberation, had also taught them to count less and less on a rapid end to the epidemic.” In this middle moment between initial infection and final eradication — the very lengthy moment “The Plague” focused on — Camus’s characters prioritized perseverance and small acts of kindness. Flipping back through the book as I wrote this, the power of consistency re-emerged. Dr. Bernard Rieux, “struggling against the world as it was,” provided both treatment for the sick and an ear for the struggles of the anxious. He was a hero of small things, a hero of careful carrying on. Perhaps that’s what we all need to aim for as well. “The decent man,” Camus wrote, “the one who doesn’t infect anybody, is the one who concentrates most.” What are you reading for insight on the pandemic?

Mothers’ Power in U.S. Protests Echoes a Global Tradition,2020-07-25,By Amanda Taub,"['Wearing matching shades of white or yellow, the women of the “Wall of Moms” in Portland, Ore., have become instant icons of the city’s protests, though the mothers nightly gatherings only began last Saturday and the city’s protests have been going on for more than a month. They join a long line of mothers’ protests against state violence and what they view as authoritarianism around the world, including in South Africa, Sri Lanka, Argentina and Armenia, which have shown that mothers can be particularly effective advocates for a cause — but also that there is a catch. History suggests that mothers’ power is most potent when they are able to wield their own respectability, and the protections it brings, as a political cudgel. But that is easiest for women who are already privileged: married, affluent, and members of the dominant racial or ethnic group. Mothers who are less privileged often struggle to claim that power, even though they are often the ones who most urgently need it. Teressa Raiford, a Black mother who is the executive director of Don’t Shoot Portland, a local group that works to end police violence, helped to organize and direct the Wall of Moms’ early actions, but noted that the positive response to the mostly white mothers has been proof of the very racism they are protesting. Mothers had been participating in the protests for five weeks, but “nobody recognized them until they literally put on white so they could be highlighted as white,” she said. “What it does show us is that Black lives don’t matter here, white moms do,” she said. “And those moms know that, too. That’s why they’re standing in solidarity with us.” Bev Barnum — who posted the original Facebook message asking moms to come and protest, and serves as the group’s informal leader and organizer — said she had asked women to color-coordinate their outfits in order to stand out in the crowd, but otherwise told them to dress “like they were going to Target.” “I wanted us to look like moms,” Ms. Barnum said in an interview. “Because who wants to shoot a mom? No one.” Ms. Barnum said she identified as Mexican-American, not white, but other members say the group is mostly white. Mothers’ protests are often powerful precisely because the gender roles that ordinarily silence and sideline women, allowing them to be seen as nonthreatening, turn into armor for political activism, experts say. During Armenia’s 2018 “velvet revolution,” a largely nonviolent uprising that eventually toppled the country’s leader, Serzh Sargsyan, mothers took to the streets pushing their children in strollers, indelibly tying their maternal identities to their political demands. In Armenia, “mothers are symbolic to the nation and, to some extent, have immunity in protests,” Ulrike Ziemer, a sociologist at the University of Winchester in Britain, wrote in a 2019 book chapter about the uprising. “If police would have touched mothers with their children in prams during the protests, that would have brought shame on them individually, but also on the state apparatus they represent.” In the Armenian protests, mothers from all walks of life were able to claim those protections, Dr. Ziemer said in an interview. But in societies that are divided along racial or ethnic lines, mothers from marginalized groups cannot access that full political power so easily. In South Africa, the Black Sash, a group of white women who opposed the apartheid regime, were able to use their gender and race as a shield for their political activity that others could not. “The Government has let Black Sash survive while closing down other anti-apartheid groups in part because white South African society has perched its women on pedestals,” The Times reported in 1988. “The police find it awkward to pack the paddy wagons with well-bred troublemakers who look like their mothers or sisters.” The government had no such compunction about locking up Black women. Albertina Sisulu, a pioneering Black anti-apartheid activist who was also a married mother of five, was arrested and held in solitary confinement multiple times. Countless other Black women suffered even worse fates. In Sri Lanka, women from the Tamil minority group have been protesting for years to demand information about sons and daughters who were kidnapped by state forces during the country’s civil war and never heard from again. Their activism has drawn international attention and some limited engagement from the country’s government. But when the women’s demands went beyond their own individual grief and engaged with politics more broadly, national politicians and civil society groups dismissed them as pawns of male activists, said Dharsha Jegatheeswaran, co-director of the Adayaalam Centre for Policy Research, a Sri Lanka-based think tank. As members of a marginalized minority group, she said, motherhood could take them only so far. In the United States, there is a long tradition of Black women claiming their identities as mothers when protesting against police shootings, lynchings, and mass incarceration. But, like the Tamil activists in Sri Lanka, they have tended to be viewed through the narrow lens of their own grief and fear for their children. White women have typically been taken far more seriously by white audiences as representing mothers generally — another case of bias on display. Ann Gregory, a lawyer and mother of two who joined the wall of moms in Portland on Sunday, said they had hoped to serve as a buffer between other demonstrators and law enforcement. “We realize that we’re a bunch of white women, and we do have privilege,” she said. “We were hoping to use that to protect the protesters.” Instead, the women got a crash course in the grievances that had set off the protests in the first place. Ms. Barnum, new to such activism, said she was surprised when other demonstrators warned her group that they could be in danger. “The news said that if you give the police officer a reason to fear for their life, a reasonable fear, they could hurt you,” she said. “But if you didn’t give them a reason then they wouldn’t hurt you.” The moms, she reasoned, would be peaceful and give the officers no cause for alarm, so had no reason to worry. That may seem an unusual belief for someone attending a protest against police violence, but it illustrates the privilege taken for granted by many people who have not had run-ins with law enforcement. So on her first night at the protests, when federal officers fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades at the group of moms, “I couldn’t believe what was happening,” she said. “We weren’t being violent. We weren’t screaming expletives at them.” The power wielded by police has long been justified with the claim that officers must be able to use force when necessary to protect themselves or the public, and that people who have done nothing wrong have nothing to fear. Black activists and their allies have been contesting that claim for years, but the tide of public opinion has been slow to turn against law enforcement. However, when officers fire tear gas and projectiles at soccer moms holding sunflowers, as happened in Portland on Sunday night, even more observers — who may not previously have thought they could be at risk — see that as a fate that might befall anyone. And history suggests that could have profound political consequences. In Argentina in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, women whose children had been “disappeared” by the military government — seized, tortured and murdered in secret — were the most visible opposition to the regime, with their distinctive white kerchiefs. They “continually pointed out that the majority of the disappeared were not terrorists, as the junta claimed, but loyal members of the opposition, including people who had never engaged in politics and even some members of the establishment,” the political scientist Marguerite Guzman Bouvard wrote in “Revolutionizing Motherhood,” her 2002 book on the group. “In shattering the lies that served as a rationale for the junta’s terror,” Dr. Bouvard wrote, “the Mothers exposed the glaring weakness of the entire system.” There are obvious differences between the Argentine dictatorship of and the United States today. But Ms. Gregory, the Portland mother who joined Sunday’s demonstration, was deeply disturbed by the federal officers’ violent response to the protest. “We weren’t any danger to them,” she said. “We were just standing there with flowers. We’re a bunch of middle-aged moms.” “This isn’t what America is supposed to be like,” she said. “We’re not supposed to be ruled by militarized, jackbooted forces.” Ms. Raiford, the longtime activist, is cautiously hopeful about the power of that message — and its messengers. “Sometimes when people hear activists say ‘Black lives matter,’ they say ‘well that has nothing to do with me.’” she said. “But when we talk about the intrinsic value of humanity, and how all of our lives intersect because we have children, we have families, we live in communities, we have loved ones, I think that that creates less of a barrier.” She hopes the attention on the moms will help to spread that message. “We don’t need silent victims,” she said. “We need loud witnesses.”']",When mothers take to the streets — particularly those from privileged groups — governments take note. The “wall of moms” in Portland has taken up the cause against police violence.
Officials Push U.S.-China Relations Toward Point of No Return,2020-07-25,By Edward Wong and Steven Lee Myers,"['WASHINGTON — Step by step, blow by blow, the United States and China are dismantling decades of political, economic and social engagement, setting the stage for a new era of confrontation shaped by the views of the most hawkish voices on both sides. With President Trump trailing badly in the polls as the election nears, his national security officials have intensified their attack on China in recent weeks, targeting its officials, diplomats and executives. While the strategy has reinforced a key campaign message, some American officials, worried Mr. Trump will lose, are also trying to engineer irreversible changes, according to people familiar with the thinking. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has inflamed the fight, brushing aside international concern about the country’s rising authoritarianism to consolidate his own political power and to crack down on basic freedoms, from Xinjiang to Hong Kong. By doing so, he has hardened attitudes in Washington, fueling a clash that at least some in China believe could be dangerous to the country’s interests. The combined effect could prove to be Mr. Trump’s most consequential foreign policy legacy, even if it’s not one he has consistently pursued: the entrenchment of a fundamental strategic and ideological confrontation between the world’s two largest economies. A state of broad and intense competition is the end goal of the president’s hawkish advisers. In their view, confrontation and coercion, aggression and antagonism should be the status quo with the Chinese Communist Party, no matter who is leading the United States next year. They call it “reciprocity.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared in a speech on Thursday that the relationship should be based on the principle of “distrust and verify,” saying that the diplomatic opening orchestrated by President Richard M. Nixon nearly half a century ago had ultimately undermined American interests. “We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come: that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won’t get it done,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We must not continue it and we must not return to it.” The events of the last week brought relations to yet another low, accelerating the downward spiral. On Tuesday, the State Department ordered China to shut down its Houston consulate, prompting diplomats there to burn documents in a courtyard. On Friday, in retaliation, China ordered the United States to close its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu. The Chinese Foreign Ministry the next day denounced what it called “forced entry” into the Houston consulate by U.S. law enforcement officers on Friday afternoon. In between, the Department of Justice announced criminal charges against four members of the People’s Liberation Army for lying about their status in order to operate as undercover intelligence operatives in the United States. All four have been arrested. One, Tang Juan, who was studying at the University of California, Davis, ignited a diplomatic standoff when she sought refuge in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, but was taken into custody on Thursday night. This comes on top of a month in which the administration announced sanctions on senior Chinese officials, including a member of the ruling Politburo, over the mass internment of Muslims; revoked the special status of Hong Kong in diplomatic and trade relations; and declared that China’s vast maritime claims in the South China Sea were illegal. The administration has also imposed a travel ban on Chinese students at graduate level or higher with ties to military institutions in China. Officials are discussing whether to do the same to members of the Communist Party and their families, a sweeping move that could put 270 million people on a blacklist. “Below the president, Secretary Pompeo and other members of the administration appear to have broader goals,” said Ryan Hass, a China director on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council who is now at the Brookings Institution. “They want to reorient the U.S.-China relationship toward an all-encompassing systemic rivalry that cannot be reversed by the outcome of the upcoming U.S. election,” he said. “They believe this reorientation is needed to put the United States on a competitive footing against its 21st-century geostrategic rival.” From the start, Mr. Trump has vowed to change the relationship with China, but mainly when it comes to trade. Early this year, the negotiated truce in the countries’ trade war was hailed by some aides as a signature accomplishment. That deal is still in effect, though hanging by a thread, overshadowed by the broader fight. Beyond China, few of the administration’s foreign policy goals have been fully achieved. Mr. Trump’s personal diplomacy with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, has done nothing to end the country’s nuclear weapons program. His withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has further alienated allies and made that country’s leaders even more belligerent. His effort to change the government in Venezuela failed. His promised withdrawal of all American troops from Afghanistan has yet to occur. In Beijing, some officials and analysts have publicly dismissed many of the Trump administration’s moves as campaign politics, accusing Mr. Pompeo and others of promoting a Cold War mentality to score points for an uphill re-election fight. There is a growing recognition, though, that the conflict’s roots run deeper. The breadth of the administration’s campaign has vindicated those in China — and possibly Mr. Xi himself — who have long suspected that the United States will never accept the country’s growing economic and military might, or its authoritarian political system. “It’s not just electoral considerations,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. “It is also a natural escalation and a result of the inherent contradictions between China and the United States.” Already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, some Chinese officials have sought to avoid open conflict with the United States. They have urged the Trump administration to reconsider each of its actions and called for cooperation, not confrontation, albeit without offering significant concessions of their own. “With global anti-China sentiment at its highest level in decades, Chinese officials have indicated an interest in exploring potential offramps to the current death spiral in U.S.-China relations,” said Jessica Chen Weiss, a political scientist at Cornell University who studies Chinese foreign policy and public opinion. “Beijing isn’t spoiling for an all-out fight with the United States,” she said, “but at a minimum the Chinese government will retaliate to show the world — and a prospective Biden administration — that China won’t be intimidated or pushed around.” Given the size of each nation’s economy and their entwinement, there are limits to the unwinding of relations, or what some Trump officials call “decoupling.” In the United States, tycoons and business executives, who exercise enormous sway among politicians of both parties, will continue to push for a more moderate approach, as members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet who represent Wall Street interests have done. China is making leaps in science, technology and education that Americans and citizens of other Western nations will want to share in. In his Thursday speech, even Mr. Pompeo acknowledged, “China is deeply integrated into the global economy.” Only two weeks ago, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on the United States to step back from confrontation and work with China. In reality, officials in Beijing appear resigned to the likelihood that nothing will change for the better before next year. “There is very little China can do to take the initiative,” said Wu Qiang, an independent analyst in Beijing. “It has very few proactive options.” Mr. Trump whipsaws in his language on China. He has called Mr. Xi “a very, very good friend” and even privately encouraged him to keep building mass internment camps for Muslims and handle the Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters his way, according to a new book by John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser. When he last spoke with Mr. Xi, he expressed “much respect!” on Twitter.  With the election looming, Mr. Trump’s tone has changed. He has returned to bashing China, as he did in 2016, blaming Beijing for the pandemic and even referring to the coronavirus with a racist phrase, “Kung Flu.” His campaign aides have made aggressive rhetoric on China a pillar of their strategy, believing it could help energize voters. The heated language, combined with the administration’s policy actions, could actually be having a galvanizing effect on Chinese citizens, some analysts and political figures in Beijing say. “I strongly urge American people to re-elect Trump because his team has many crazy members like Pompeo,” Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalist newspaper Global Times, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “They help China strengthen solidarity and cohesion in a special way.” The relationship might not change course even if former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. defeats Mr. Trump in November. The idea of orienting American policy toward competition with China has had robust bipartisan support over the last three-and-a-half years. The Chinese government’s initial mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak and its actions in Hong Kong, which is widely seen as a beacon of liberal values within China, have been signal moments this year, contributing to the tectonic shift in views across the political spectrum. The China hawks in the administration have seized on them to publicly push their perspective: that the Chinese Communist Party seeks to expand its ideology and authoritarian vision worldwide, and that citizens of liberal nations must wake up to the dangers and gird themselves for a conflict that could last for decades. Since late June, the administration has rolled out four top officials to make that case. Attorney General William P. Barr accused American companies of “corporate appeasement,” while Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, said his agency was opening a new China-related counterintelligence investigation every 10 hours. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, warned that the Chinese Communist Party aimed to remake the world in its image. “The effort to control thought beyond the borders of China is well underway,” he said. Mr. Pompeo’s speech on Thursday was meant as the punctuation mark. He chose the presidential library of the man credited with opening up U.S.-China relations to declare the policy a failure. “President Nixon once said he feared he had created a ‘Frankenstein’ by opening the world to the C.C.P.,” Mr. Pompeo said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party, “and here we are.” Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul, South Korea.

Video Surfaces of Execution of Aid Workers and Others Abducted in Nigeria,2020-07-23,By Ruth Maclean,"['DAKAR, Senegal — A Nigerian terrorist group has executed five men — three of them aid workers — who disappeared while providing assistance in the northeastern state of Borno last month. A video surfaced on Wednesday showing the men kneeling and blindfolded. They were then shot. The West African country of Nigeria has endured more than 10 years of abductions, killings and other abuses by armed Islamist groups, but regional governments have recently cracked down on insurgents, claiming to have killed thousands.  A group allied with the Islamic State, Islamic State West Africa Province, or I.S.W.A.P., is thought to be behind the executions of the five men, all Nigerians. The men had been traveling between Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, the Nigerian region hardest hit by terrorist attacks, and the town of Monguno when they were kidnapped. Local news outlets reported that they were aid workers with Action Against Hunger and the International Rescue Committee. One worked for Nigeria’s State Emergency Management Agency. Terrorist groups in northeastern Nigeria are often known by the catchall name Boko Haram, the nickname of the original group that took up arms in 2009, of which I.S.W.A.P. is a splinter group. Unlike the original Boko Haram, I.S.W.A.P. at first targeted mostly Christians, people affiliated with the state, and employees of international aid organizations. More recently, it has begun killing other Muslims too, some analysts have said. The group frequently abducts and executes aid workers after attempting to elicit ransoms. Over the past decade, northeastern Nigeria has been destabilized by armed men preaching radicalism who gained traction by airing grievances against the state. They pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, before splintering into several groups. Tens of thousands of civilians have since been killed, raped, abducted and tortured. President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to crush the terrorists and return peace to the northeast, but attacks have continued, and national forces have been accused of abuses that perpetuate the crisis. The insurgency was subdued somewhat in Mr. Buhari’s first term, analysts say, but has recently been bouncing back. The day before the execution video surfaced, Nigerian lawmakers, concerned about soldiers leaving the army in large numbers, asked the country’s security chiefs to step down, according to local media. The aid workers killed were Ishaku Yakubu, an employee of Action Against Hunger, Abdulrahman Dungus, who worked for an affiliate of France’s Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, and Luka Filibus, a child protection officer with the aid group International Rescue Committee. Joseph Prince, a security worker, and Abdulrahman Bulama, a displaced persons’ camp coordinator working for the Nigerian state, were also shot. In a video released in June, Mr. Filibus appealed to his employer to save him. He was a former displaced person himself. “Luka and his family were forced to flee their home, and he was still compelled to alleviate the suffering of children,” the aid group said in a statement after the execution video came out. “He dedicated his life to protecting children and to help lessen their trauma in the face of crisis. His colleagues in Nigeria remember him always with a smile on his face.” Ismail Alfa contributed reporting from Maiduguri, Nigeria.']","Five men — three aid workers, a government employee and a security worker — were abducted in June.

"Vietnam, Lauded in Coronavirus Fight, Has First Local Case in 100 Days",2020-07-25,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — Vietnam, which had gone 100 days without reporting a case of local transmission of the coronavirus, said on Saturday that a 57-year-old grandfather in the central city of Danang had tested positive. How he got the illness remains a mystery. To prevent a wider outbreak, the Health Ministry said it was conducting “extensive screening and testing in all at-risk areas in Danang.” Officials said they had tested and quarantined people who had been in close contact with the patient and were tracing others. So far, no other positive cases have surfaced. The case of the Danang grandfather is yet another sign of how difficult it is to contain the virus even when a country has followed the best practices. The patient has no record of recent travel and appears to be a homebody who spends most of his time looking after his grandchildren. Health officials, noting that mask use in Vietnam had become lax, urged members of the public to resume wearing them, especially in crowded places and on public transportation. Vietnam, one of the world’s few remaining communist states, has been among the most successful in the world in containing the virus. Soon after the illness emerged in China, Vietnam’s northern neighbor, the government quickly closed international borders, called for widespread use of masks and established strict quarantine and aggressive contact-tracing procedures. Most foreigners are still barred from traveling to Vietnam, and returning citizens are required to go into quarantine, which is where all of Vietnam’s other recent cases have been found. The public has embraced the campaign and rallied around one famous case, that of Scottish pilot, Stephen Cameron, 43, who came so close to death that doctors in Ho Chi Minh City contemplated giving him a double-lung transplant. He spent more than two months on life support in a medically induced coma but recovered and flew home two weeks ago. As of Saturday, Vietnam had reported 416 cases and no deaths. Its last known case of local transmission was in mid-April. The government has been considering resuming international flights to countries where the virus has been contained. The discovery of the new case in Danang was a shock. Many people reportedly canceled travel plans in central Vietnam, a popular destination for domestic and foreign travelers. The 57-year-old man, known as Patient 416, first showed signs of a cough and fever on July 17 and was admitted to a hospital three days later. He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia. An X-ray showed lung lesions and, after he suffered respiratory failure, he was put on a ventilator. His tests for Covid-19 were positive from the outset, but it was not until Saturday, when the fourth test result came back, that the government officially declared that he had Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The country’s acting health minister, Nguyen Thanh Long, confirmed the finding at a meeting on Saturday of the National Steering Committee for Covid-19. Health investigators concluded that the patient had not traveled outside Danang, one of Vietnam’s largest cities, and had rarely left home in the month before becoming ill. On July 7, he took his 92-year-old mother to a medical center for treatment for her heart ailment and, on July 16, visited her at the hospital where she had been transferred. On July 17, he began to feel tired and feverish but attended an engagement party. The next day, he went to a family wedding. Health officials said that more than 100 people with whom he had been in contact had tested negative for the virus. About 50 of them have been placed in isolation as a further precaution. Specialist teams were sent from other parts of the country, including from Cho Ray Hospital, where Mr. Cameron was treated, to help with the treatment of Patient 416, whose condition appeared to be deteriorating. “This patient is suffering from acute pneumonia with severe symptoms and rapid progression,” according to a statement posted on Friday by the Health Ministry, and doctors were pursuing “a maximum treatment regimen.” Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi.']","A 57-year-old grandfather in the city of Danang, with no history of travel, tested positive and has been hospitalized.

‘Pure Instinct’: The Extraordinary Rescue of 2 French Boys From a Fire,2020-07-24,By Adam Nossiter,"['PARIS — Both the rescuers and the rescued refused accolades for bravery. But both were saluted across France on Friday for coming together in an extraordinary act that saved the lives of two small children threatened by a raging fire this week in a third-floor apartment in Grenoble. The biggest hero was a 10-year-old boy, Sofiane Laout, who plucked up his 3-year-old brother, Soleiman, by his T-shirt, and dropped him out the window into the arms of rescuers nearly 40 feet below. Then he leapt out right after him. “I just closed my eyes, and jumped,” Sofiane told French radio in a nonchalant interview Friday morning, three days after the incident. The rescuers caught him as well, and suffered broken arms and wrists as a result. Friday night, Sofiane’s mother, Rachida Laout, said the little boy was too tired to come to the phone. The brothers could be heard shouting in the background. “My son is very brave,” she said. “Both of them are very brave. They are alive thanks to the people in the neighborhood, all those who were below. These are good people.” The family could scarcely believe the extraordinary sequence that saved the children. “It was almost a catastrophe. We came right up against the death of those boys,” their uncle, Farid Laout, said in a telephone interview Friday night. He had arrived on the scene shortly after the rescue, when flames and smoke were still pouring from the apartment. His two little nephews were still stunned. “They were in shock,” Mr. Laout said. “The little one didn’t even realize what had happened.” The rescue itself hung on the merest chance. “There were maybe five or six of us. We did not plan anything,” one of the rescuers, Athoumani Walid, said in an interview Friday night. “It was pure instinct. We wanted to save them but we did not know how. We told each other we needed to come together to catch them during the fall. It was the only solution,” said Mr. Walid, a 25-year-old student from the Comoro Islands. Sofiane told his uncle afterward: “Either I jump, or I die.” After pitching Soleiman down to the men below, “he saw that his brother was alive, and that gave him confidence,” Mr. Laout said. The boys’ parents were out, the mother shopping and the father at work. “It all happened in the space of 20 minutes,” Mr. Laout said. “Quickly, quickly I will be back,” Ms. Laout said she told the boys, who were not seriously harmed. The drama unfolded in a 1960s-era apartment block in the immigrant and poor Villeneuve district, which has a troubled recent history. There were riots there in 2010 after a man accused of robbery was killed in a shootout with the police. The president of France at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, delivered a harshly anti-immigrant speech in the wake of the rioting, which provoked sharp reactions in the country, and for which he later apologized. The neighborhood is scorned by residents of prosperous central Grenoble as a haven of crime and ethnic separatism, said a local writer, Hervé Bienfait, who wrote a book about Villeneuve. “It suffers from its reputation,” he said. But it is unfair, Mr. Bienfait said, and in this case the residents, immigrants and children of immigrants, pulled together in an “extraordinary act,” he said. “It doesn’t surprise me. It’s a neighborhood where there is a lot of initiative.” Stéphane Gemmani, a regional councilor from Grenoble, agreed that the neighborhood’s true spirit was expressed in the rescue. “There’s a real solidarity in this multicultural place, rooted in Mediterranean values, where everyone cares for each other,” he said. On Friday, Grenoble’s mayor, Éric Piolle, said the rescuers would be awarded the city’s medal. Prosecutors said the two parents would be questioned for “abandonment.” The police are unsure about why the fire broke out, but by the time the rescuers gathered, a thick column of black smoke was pouring out the window, as captured in a video shot by a resident. “I was in my room watching TV. And then the smoke started coming,” Sofiane told French radio Friday. “I tried to escape into the kitchen, and then the smoke started coming in there too.” Mr. Walid said he “saw a child at the window crying for help.” “He told me he was from the third floor but did not have the keys,” Mr. Walid said. “We were three coming up the stairs, and we heard shouts behind the door. We tried to smash the door but it was too hard. It was impossible,” he said. At that point, the decision was made to gather under the window and catch the boys. “We came downstairs where everybody shouted: ‘Jump! Jump!’” Mr. Walid said. Sofiane held his brother in the air for a few seconds by his T-shirt “I put my little brother out the window, so that he could breathe,” Sofiane told French radio. The rescuers, gathered below, yelled up to Sofiane to throw his brother down. The older brother let go of the T-shirt, and the 3-year-old whirled in the air before landing in the arms of the men below. “We repeated to him to jump, which he finally did,” said Mr. Walid. “They were telling me to jump,” Sofiane said. “Right, OK, so I jumped.” Constant Méheut and Théophile Larcher contributed reporting.']","The story of how two brothers, 10 and 3, were saved from a burning apartment: “There were maybe five or six of us,” said one of the rescuers. “We did not plan anything.”"
"Erdogan Fulfills Cherished Goal, Opening Hagia Sophia to Prayers",2020-07-24,By Carlotta Gall,"['ISTANBUL — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sealed his long-stated desire to restore the historic Hagia Sophia as a working mosque on Friday, opening the magnificent Byzantine structure built in the sixth century as the world’s largest cathedral to thousands of Muslim worshipers for the first time in nearly nine decades. Huge crowds began gathering even in the pre-dawn hours around Hagia Sophia, to attend Friday Prayer, a crowning moment for Mr. Erdogan after 18 years at the helm of Turkish politics. Under heavy police security, worshipers settled on the streets and sidewalks on their rugs, covering their faces with masks against the coronavirus and their heads with makeshift shades as the sun grew searingly hot. Every cobbled street around the mosque was packed, as well as the open spaces along the length of the ancient hippodrome where Roman chariots once raced. Mr. Erdogan arrived at noon, wearing a mask, and sat on the mosque floor, head bowed and eyes closed, listening to the melodic recitation of the Quran, which was carried live on national television. At 1 p.m., the crowd fell silent and knelt in unison, as the head mufti, his hands clasped on the hilt of the sword of conquest, gave his sermon. “This is a festival for us today, we are so happy,” said Selahattin Yigiter, a retired businessman who was sitting with his wife on a prayer mat on the sidewalk below the nearly 1,500-year-old building. “With the pressure of Muslim people it is reconverted.” But the atmosphere of celebration among the Muslim faithful in Turkey contrasted with the angst and dismay Mr. Erdogan’s decision has generated among Christians around the world and among many in academic and conservation communities. Built in the sixth century by a Byzantine emperor, Justinian I, Hagia Sophia was for nearly a thousand years the largest church in the world and the center of Christendom. In 1453, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II conquered Constantinople and converted the majestic building into a mosque: It became one of Islam’s holiest sites. Under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic, Hagia Sophia was turned into a museum and all religious services ended. For the past 86 years, it has stood as monument to the competing of empires and religions whose histories had melded, sometimes awkwardly, at the World Heritage site. Just hours before the event, the government announced that the entire World Heritage site, which encompasses several nearby historic buildings, would be closed for ordinary business for 24 hours, bemusing some international tourists caught unawares. But Hagia Sophia would stay open all night through to Saturday morning to allow the faithful the chance to pray inside the mosque, Ali Yerlikaya, the governor of Istanbul, said in a televised news briefing on the eve of the event. Many in Turkey see the move as pure political theater, part of Mr. Erdogan’s effort to buoy his political standing, which has wobbled after nearly two decades atop Turkish politics and as the pandemic further set back an already shaky economy. The leader of the main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said he would not be attending the opening not because he was opposed to the conversion, but because did not believe in making a display of praying before television cameras. When leading a march for justice across the country three years ago, he had prayed privately in a mosque without cameras, party leaders pointed out. “It is all symbolism and optics,” said Soner Cagaptay, a fellow and the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “Restoring Hagia Sophia as a mosque is a long-stated goal of the Islamists. It is something he has always believed in,” Mr. Cagaptay added, referring to Mr. Erdogan, “and he wants to do it before he is gone.” Mr. Erdogan’s long tenure in power has been marked by an assertive foreign policy abroad and megaprojects at home, including large mosques at prominent sites, designed to evoke the glory days of the old Ottoman Empire. Restoring Hagia Sophia as a mosque is a capstone of his reign, Mr. Cagaptay said. According to one media report, Mr. Erdogan let it be known that he did not sleep all night after signing the decree to restore its status as a mosque such was his emotion. There was no doubt that Mr. Erdogan and many conservative Muslims and Turkish nationalists were thrilled by the decision. Muzaffer Demir, a hotel manager who had traveled from the capital, Ankara, with his wife and 13-year-old daughter to be present, described his emotions at the occasion as “excitement, happiness and tears.” Mr. Erdogan visited Hagia Sophia twice to oversee preparations, posing for photos, the second time on Thursday evening with his wife, Emine, in front of white drapery that has been suspended in the apse to conceal one of the famous mosaics, depicting the Virgin and Child. But as the decision has become reality, and work has gone apace to prepare for a grand reopening ceremony, including the covering of the marble floor and the figurative medieval mosaics, dismay has rippled across cultural and academic circles around the globe. In one of the strongest protests, the Italian Association for Byzantine Studies, headed by Antonio Rigo at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, warned that turning Hagia Sophia into a working mosque in today’s Turkey would mean confining the monument to abuse and suffocation. “Hagia Sophia is not merely a monument, but a rich and inexhaustible source of historical knowledge, a document open to investigation,” the association said in an open letter. “Through its reversion back into a place of worship, with all the inevitable alterations this entails — it was destined to become closed and silent,” it said. Turkey was already conducting a slow but systematic effort to cover up its Byzantine past by making alterations in half a dozen Byzantine churches restored into mosques around the country, the association said. It deplored what it said was an “egregious display of intolerance and ideological narrowness” from Mr. Erdogan and condemned what it described as exaltation of the violence of conquest. The association appealed to scholars and “members of humanity” to take a stand and prevent an “act of abuse against all peoples of the world and against their hopes for reconciliation and peace.” Art historians lamented the covering of the basilica’s floor, famous for its variety of colored and patterned marbles, which are laid in geometric or symmetrical designs and act as important ritualistic or imperial markers, including of the place where emperors were crowned. A 2,000 square meter turquoise wool carpet, specially woven for Hagia Sophia, has been laid over half of the floor inside the mosque, with extra layers of felt to fill in the unevenness of the centuries-old marble flagstones. Television footage of the interior seemed to show one of the most important spots — that where emperors were crowned — remained exposed. Mehmed II, when he conquered Constantinople, was impressed by the grandeur of the building and took care to preserve it, both Islamists and academics concur. “In Hagia Sophia, whose dome stands as though suspended from the heavens, emperors were crowned; in Hagia Sophia, the splendor of the Orthodox liturgy led to the conversion of the Russian people; in Hagia Sophia, on the morning of May 29, 1453, the terrified people gathered for one last, desperate prayer,” the association wrote. “The conqueror was amazed by the magnificence of the building — so much so that, according to our sources, he struck a soldier who, blinded with fanaticism, was shattering the marble floor.” But Turks who gathered to celebrate the reopening of the Great Mosque of Ayasofya, as it is known in Turkey, on Friday were adamant that the building rightly belonged to Muslims. “Ayasofya is reconquered,” Mr. Demir, the hotel manager, said. Turkey’s Muslims had taken back what was theirs, his wife added. Mr. Yigiter, the retired businessman, commended Mr. Erdogan’s bravery in taking a stand and ignoring international opprobrium. Supporters of Mr. Erdogan also acknowledged they had needed the decision to boost their morale after losing Istanbul in mayoral elections last year. “It is something we were waiting for, for years,” said Dilek Aydin, a schoolteacher with her 16-year-old daughter. “We are the leader of the world, we proved that. We slammed our first on the table.” Members of the tiny Greek community, which numbers only 1,800 today in Turkey, were anxious about where the Hagia Sophia decision would lead, said Mihail Vasiliadis, editor in chief of the Greek-language daily Apoyevmatini. The older ones, including himself, are survivors of pogroms against the Greek community in 1955 and most are fearful, he said. “They hesitate to speak their thoughts and if they are sad religiously they are not in a state to identify that.’’ Turkey’s minorities have felt a shift in the mood in the country in recent years since Mr. Erdogan allied himself with the main nationalist party, said Yetvart Danzikyan, editor in chief of Agos, an Armenian newspaper based in Istanbul. “Many people believe that this is the result of the Islamization and nationalization of politics in the last five years,” he said, “and they find this concerning.”']","The Muslim faithful celebrated the decision by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, even as it generated dismay among Christians and architectural conservators."
"In Afghan Attacks, Facts Are Murky. But It’s Clear Deaths Are Piling Up.",2020-07-23,By Asadullah Timory and Mujib Mashal,"['HERAT, Afghanistan — For a full day after airstrikes on a remote village in western Afghanistan on Wednesday, the only certainty was that people had perished. The most basic facts — who had carried out the strikes, and how many Taliban and civilians were killed — were impossible to pin down amid the denials, conflicting statements and exaggerations. With the start of peace talks between the Taliban and the government delayed by months, the Afghan war has spiraled into a deadlier phase, even as the United States continues to withdraw its forces. Car bombs, roadside bombs and airstrikes wreak carnage across the country, killing dozens of Afghans everyday. But as the war has spread, the exact nature of the attacks and their toll, particularly on civilians, has increasingly grown opaque. The Taliban often flatly deny incidents that kill civilians, even when the bodies are there to be buried. Protest and pressure turns the government’s denials of civilian casualties in its operations into investigations that rarely result in follow-through or answers. The U.S. military, after a deal with the Taliban in February that was supposed to produce something resembling a cease-fire between them, has quietly returned to striking Taliban units that it sees as preparing attacks on its Afghan allies, but it no longer officially acknowledges those strikes. Making the battlefield still more murky has been the presence of other militant groups in addition to the Taliban, including factions with long ties to Al Qaeda as well as a branch of the Islamic State. The airstrikes on Wednesday in the Guzara district of Herat Province struck a group of 100 to 150 people who had gathered to welcome a Taliban member who had been held by the government, according to survivors, local officials and community leaders. He was released as part of a prisoner swap that is supposed to open the way for direct negotiations between the insurgents and the government. As part of the U.S. deal with the insurgents, the Afghan government was expected to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for 1,000 Afghan troops. But the government opposed the trade at first, and then only agreed to a phased release of captives after pressure from the Trump administration. Afghan officials say about 4,000 Taliban prisoners have been released so far — and some of them, they claim, have returned to the battlefield. The Taliban have released about 800 of the Afghan troops. As the prisoner swap dragged on for months, the Taliban cranked up its attacks across the country. Feeling pressure, the Afghan government announced it was going on the offensive, although its troops have been forced to largely defend against Taliban assaults. American aircraft, mostly drones and A-10 jets, have carried out at least 40 strikes on Taliban targets since the Feb. 29 agreement, a U.S. military official familiar with the operations said. But the Pentagon has not openly acknowledged most of its attacks, in an attempt to keep the already shaky peace process on track. In recent days, a bloody wave of violence has intensified. A Taliban roadside bomb killed seven members of the security forces, including senior local officials, in southern Uruzgan Province. In northern Baghlan Province, the Afghan air force struck two houses, an attack based on intelligence that Taliban fighters were staying there. Officials later found out that the insurgents had left and the strikes had killed five civilians, according to the district governor. In Kandahar Province, a Taliban infiltrator killed about a dozen police officers.  In Khogyani district in the east, the Afghan government said 31 Taliban were killed in one battle, which involved heavy air power. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan peace, condemned the Guzara airstrikes, saying that civilians were among the casualties. He also condemned the spate of recent Taliban attacks. “The last 24 hours have been very violent in Afghanistan with many losing their lives,” Mr. Khalilzad wrote on Twitter. “The Afghan people want an immediate start of peace negotiations and a settlement that is in their best interest. More graves will not bring negotiations forward.” But exactly what happened in Guzara, and how many people were killed, remained uncertain. Increasingly, it appeared the casualties were a mix of Taliban and civilians, as is often the case. Arbab Sarbeland, a local leader from the neighboring Adraskan district who was there for the ceremony, said helicopter gunships started hitting the area around 9 a.m. After the helicopters left, survivors loaded three dead and four wounded people into cars, but that turned out to be just the first of several attacks that day. It is not clear how many times the helicopters circled back to strike again, or if other aircraft were also involved. Noor Ahmad Khan, who was at the district center during the attack, said a relative he had dispatched to the village for information had told him the civilian toll stood at 12 dead and 22 wounded, but he would not comment on the number of Taliban casualties. Late on Wednesday, Abdul Salam Azimi, the police chief of Guzara district, said “about 50 Taliban are killed or wounded.” The Taliban, in a statement that said nothing about casualties to its fighters, said 8 civilians were killed in the strikes and 12 wounded. By the end of the day on Wednesday, it still wasn’t clear who had carried out the attack. American officials said it wasn’t the U.S. military. A spokesman for Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said it had “not carried out any airstrike in Herat,” and denied claims that one of the strikes had hit a vehicle carrying women and children. What damaged the vehicle, he said, was “actually a roadside bomb.” But around midnight, the Afghan defense ministry changed its position, admitting it had been behind the airstrikes and promising to investigate claims of civilian casualties. On Thursday, Asadullah Khalid, Afghanistan’s acting defense minister, said that he would show evidence that Afghan forces had struck Taliban fighters and that he was “hopeful there are no civilian casualties.” The Defense Ministry on Thursday afternoon released a 30-second video clip as evidence it had struck the Taliban. The clip, which lacked any time or date stamp, showed about a dozen armed men around vehicles and motorcycles. There was nothing in the video to show that they were, in fact, the same men who were killed and wounded on Wednesday. Assadullah Timory reported from Herat, and Mujib Mashal from Kabul. Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting from Washington and Fahim Abed from Kabul.']","With peace talks stalled, the details of intensifying strikes across the country, and their toll on civilians, are increasingly hard to pin down.

Iraqi Security Forces Free Abducted German Arts Advocate,2020-07-24,By Alissa J. Rubin and Russell Goldman,"['Iraqi security forces have rescued a German arts advocate, just days after her early-evening abduction near one of Baghdad’s busiest streets, Iraqi and German officials said on Friday.  The rescue of the advocate, Hella Mewis, was confirmed by Gen. Yahya Rasool, the military spokesman for the Iraqi prime minister, but much about her abduction remained a mystery.  General Rasool provided no additional details, Ms. Mewis’s health and location were unknown, and it was unclear whether anyone had been detained in the course of her rescue. Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, welcomed the announcement. “I am very relieved that the kidnapped German citizen is again free and in the care of our embassy,” he said, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry on Twitter, and he thanked the Iraqi authorities for their assistance in securing her release. It was unclear where Ms. Mewis had been held, but the court on the east side of the Tigris River, the Rusafa section of the city, was put in charge of the investigation, said Abdul Sattar Al-Birqadar, the spokesman for the Iraqi Judicial Council. Ms. Mewis was snatched on Monday by assailants in two vehicles as she was leaving her office at the Beit Tarkib Arts Center, which she established with Iraqi artists to encourage and showcase their work. Ms. Mewis, 45, is originally from Berlin but had worked in the Iraqi capital since 2010. She was active in supporting antigovernment protesters, whose ranks included many intellectuals and artists. The United Nations human rights division recently documented that scores of antigovernment protesters were kidnapped during the demonstrations last fall and winter, suggesting that armed groups operating outside government control were responsible. At the time of Ms. Mewis’s abduction, the Iraqi security forces and the German Foreign Ministry each said they had created specialized teams to conduct a search and rescue.

Australian Student Sues Government Over Financial Risks of Climate Change,2020-07-23,By Isabella Kwai,"['SYDNEY, Australia — Katta O’Donnell grew up with a fear of fire. As a child, she remembers burning bark falling from the air because of wildfires. This year, she worried that the blazes sweeping across regional Australia, fueled by climate change, could destroy her home outside Melbourne, the same way they had turned thousands of acres into ash. Now, Ms. O’Donnell, 23, is leading a class-action lawsuit filed on Wednesday that accuses the Australian government of failing to disclose the material risks of climate change to those investing in government bonds. The suit accuses the government and the treasury of breaching its duty by not disclosing the risks of global warming and their material impact on investors. It is the first time, experts say, that such a climate change case has been brought against a sovereign nation. Ms. O’Donnell is joining a wave of young climate activists who have stepped on to the world stage in recent years. The Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, for example, has spurred a global protest movement, testified before the United States Congress and the European Parliament, scolded world leaders in a fiery speech at the United Nations for not doing enough and sounded that alarm at the World Economic Forum in Davos, declaring, “Our house is still on fire.” But Ms. O’Donnell’s case takes a unique tack by focusing on government bonds and the investment environment, said Jacqueline Peel, a law professor at University of Melbourne. “My personal experience with climate change makes everything I read about climate change more tangible,” Ms. O’Donnell, a fifth-year law student at La Trobe University in Melbourne, said in a recent interview. “I want my government acting with honesty and telling the truth about climate risks.” Simply put: Any risks to the country’s economic growth, value of its currency or international relations, to name a few factors, might change the value of her investment, her suit states. Ms. O’Donnell, backed by a team including two prominent lawyers, is not asking for damages, but wants the government to step up on its climate change policies. The suit seeks an injunction stopping the government from further marketing bonds until they add those disclosures. “The claim asks for disclosure of risks — it doesn’t tell the government what to do or how to act,” said David Barnden, one of three lawyers representing Ms. O’Donnell. All took her case free, they said. But experts say that the case’s strategy is interesting given that the government has the power to legislate on climate change and control, in part, that risk. The Australian government has not publicly responded to the lawsuit. Reached for comment, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said in a statement that it did not comment on current court proceedings. Australia is physically vulnerable to climate change, which has helped drive drought, broken temperature records and led to the bleaching of the Great Barrier reef, so the financial risks of investing in the country have raised concerns. In 2019, Sweden’s central bank said it was letting go of Western Australian and Queensland government bonds in part because the greenhouse emissions from both were too high. In recent years, the country’s financial and corporate regulator have pressured financial institutions that issue bonds to disclose their plans to measure and mitigate the risks related to climate change.  “One of the major issuers of securities on the global financial markets is not leading from the front,” Rob Henderson, the former chief economist for National Australia Bank, said of the government’s lack of disclosure. Ms. O’Donnell’s case builds on an emerging trend of climate litigation, with calls for private companies to take responsibility for their part in the growing threat to the planet. A Peruvian man chose to sue Germany’s largest energy company because, he said, melting glaciers exacerbated by climate change are threatening his home. Other nations, including the Pacific island of Vanuatu, which are facing a threat to their very existences because of climate change, have said they are considering taking legal action against the world’s biggest fossil-fuel companies. In all, 1,587 climate litigation cases have been brought worldwide since 1986 and May this year, with Australia second only to the United States, according to the Grantham Institute of Research on Climate Change and the Environment. The cases have been filed “as a way of either advancing or delaying effective action on climate change,” the institute says. It is unclear if Ms. O’Donnell will be successful. But with many private corporations measuring — and promising to mitigate — their contributions to climate change, there is “strong acceptance of the simple argument that climate change poses material and financial risks,” said Anita Foerster, a senior lecturer in business law at Monash University. Ms. O’ Donnell, who bought her first government-issued bonds this year, says her interest in climate law and its effect on investors began when she heard Mr. Barnden, now her lawyer, speak at a lecture last year. She said she chose her legal strategy because she wanted to educate herself and others who bought such bonds of the potential financial risks of climate change. “All routes are crucial, and we will need to unite.” she said. “But investment and the economies and the climate are all so closely linked, and that really needs to be highlighted.” “The government knows about the problem,” she added. “They know the solutions, and they know what they need to do but they’re not doing it.” Mr. Henderson said he expected the case to prompt those in other nations to follow suit: “Other people will be saying, hang on what about our government?”']",A 23-year-old law student filed a class-action suit accusing Australia of failing to disclose financial risks from climate change. Experts say it is the first of its kind.
Saudi King Is Said to Have Successful Gallbladder Surgery,2020-07-23,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — King Salman of Saudi Arabia had surgery on Thursday to remove his gallbladder, days after being hospitalized, according to a statement from the royal court carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. The announcement of the 84-year-old king’s hospitalization had revived speculation about the state of his health. But the kingdom partly quieted the murmurs by releasing on Wednesday a photograph of him conducting a virtual cabinet session from the hospital. The cabinet meeting notwithstanding, the king does not oversee the government of Saudi Arabia on a day-to-day basis; the real power lies with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his son. Since being promoted to first in line for the throne in 2017, Prince Mohammed has upended the kingdom with a dizzyingly ambitious plan to remake its economy and wean it off oil revenues, as well as instituting a brash foreign policy, cracking down on critics and introducing a rapid series of social changes. Having forced out the previous crown prince in a dramatic power grab in 2017 and sidelined other royal rivals or perceived opponents, Prince Mohammed now stands as his father’s unquestioned successor. Yet the coronavirus pandemic has dealt a serious humbling to Saudi leadership. Oil prices plummeted as the pandemic paralyzed most of the world, severing the kingdom’s main source of revenue and forcing it to announce budget cuts and painful tax increases. Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed’s plan for overhauling the economy, will most likely face a pruning, analysts say. The government also had to restrict the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, to a small fraction of the millions of Muslims who usually travel to Saudi Arabia each year — a public health measure that deprived the kingdom of the prestige of hosting Islam’s most important pilgrimage and of the tourism revenue that it brings. As the outbreak ballooned, King Salman, whose official title names him custodian of the holy mosques at Mecca and Medina, secluded himself in an island palace on the Red Sea, near Jeddah. King Salman suffered from health issues since before he ascended to the throne in 2015, taking over after the death of his brother, Abdullah. Before becoming king, Salman had served as crown prince and defense minister, and before that, as governor of Riyadh for nearly 50 years, where he was known for managing the development of the capital. With a reputation as a disciplined administrator who took charge of misbehaving royal family members, King Salman was expected to keep the kingdom on the steady, predictable course it had taken under his predecessor, with no more than perhaps a few moderate changes. But that changed with the elevation of his favored son, Prince Mohammed.']","Days after King Salman was hospitalized, renewing rumors about his health, the royal court announced that the 84-year-old monarch had undergone an operation."
"He’s 83, She’s 84, and They Model Other People’s Forgotten Laundry",2020-07-24,By Chris Horton,"['TAICHUNG, Taiwan — At Wansho Laundry in central Taiwan, most dirty clothes dropped off to be steamed or washed or dry-cleaned end up right back in the hands of their rightful owners, cleaner than when they arrived. Abandoned garments, however, can end up on Instagram. The blouses and skirts and trousers adorn the bodies of the laundry’s octogenarian owners, Chang Wan-ji and Hsu Sho-er, who have become globally famous for modeling outfits curated from the hundreds of forgotten items left behind by absent-minded customers. No one is more shocked than their 31-year-old grandson and unofficial stylist, Reef Chang, by the couple’s newfound fame. “I was really surprised,” the younger Mr. Chang said recently. “I had no idea so many foreigners would take interest in my grandparents.” He originally came up with the idea for the Instagram account, he said. Their business had slowed during the coronavirus pandemic, and his grandparents were wary about going outside even as Taiwan took highly effective measures to fight the virus. With nearly 24 million people, Taiwan has reported only 458 cases, 55 local transmissions and seven deaths. “They had nothing to do,” he said. “I saw how bored they were and wanted to brighten up their lives.” They are naturals in front of the camera. Ms. Hsu, 84, exudes the haughtiness of a supermodel but retains an air of playfulness. Mr. Chang, 83, is the perfect foil, complementing his wife’s swagger with a chill disposition while rocking bountiful eyebrows. “His eyebrows really are something else,” Ms. Hsu said smiling in an interview in the rear of the laundry shop, next to a small shrine to the earth god Tudigong, a common feature of traditional Taiwanese homes. The clothes they model are eclectic, funky and fun. Both can be seen in matching laced sneakers, and jauntily perched caps and hats. He sometimes sports brightly colored shades. One photo shows her leaning coolly against a giant washing machine, arms crossed, as he casually holds the open door, grinning. They pose at a place they know well — their shop, which provides an industrious backdrop of customers’ laundry, stacked and rolled into plastic bundles or hanging from racks. The couple’s youthful attitude appeals to a growing number of followers — 136,000 and counting — despite having only 19 posts on their account, @wantshowasyoung, since its inception on June 27. “My grandson is very creative,” Ms. Hsu said. “His creativity has made us happy, and other people, too.” The account has drawn fans from around Taiwan and the wider world, with many seeing the photos as a salve during a year made dark by worries over a global pandemic, economic ruination, climate change and geopolitical tension. “Looking at Wan-ji and Sho-er’s photos improves my mood,” one Instagram user named tibbar1 wrote on Thursday in response to a photo celebrating the account’s surpassing 100,000 followers. “Their photos really have a charming vibe to them that not just anyone can pull off.” The couple may be internet famous today, but their 61 years together had a more traditional beginning. Their story traces that of modern Taiwan, beginning during the repressive era when it was under martial law and unfolding as Taiwan gradually grew more outward-looking and confident. Mr. Chang, then 21, met Ms. Hsu in the late 1950s, when her elder sister and aunt approached him in the couple’s native Houli, a semirural district in the north of Taichung City, with the aim of making a marriage match. When they took him home to meet Ms. Hsu, he didn’t stay long, to her dismay. “I wanted him to sit down with me, but he wouldn’t,” she said. Things were more conservative back then. “He was pretty shy,” she added. But he was not put off at all. “My first time seeing her, I was delighted,” Mr. Chang said. “Not long afterward, we started discussing marriage.” The couple wed in 1959 and became parents to two sons and two daughters, and, eventually, grandparents to six. They worked together at the business that he had been managing since the age of 14, doing dry cleaning and laundry for neighbors in Houli. They built up a large clientele, some of whom still bring their laundry there despite having moved long ago to Downtown Taichung. Now, Wansho Laundry, which takes its name from the second characters of the proprietors’ names, is open daily from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m., although it sometimes closes early if it’s raining, Mr. Chang said. He and his wife are the only employees. In the 1980s, the two began traveling abroad after the end of 38 years of martial law in Taiwan, visiting the United States, Japan, Europe and Australia. Now, those travels help connect them with many of the messages coming in from all corners of the globe over their Instagram photos, the younger Mr. Chang said. “I’ll read them some of the messages we get and tell them where the senders are from, and they’ll say, ‘Ah, I’ve been there!’” he said. Mr. Chang said he hoped that his and his wife’s experience would inspire other older residents in Taiwan and elsewhere to be active. “It’s better than sitting around watching TV or napping,” he said. “I might be getting on in my years, but I don’t feel old.” Reef Chang said the past few weeks have been a special time for his grandparents — customers stick around and chat a little longer, which have made the couple happier. They are also tickled by the friendly messages sent from around the world. “Lately, whenever we eat together,” he said, “I can tell they’re elated.” Internet fame is famously fleeting, and the owners of Wansho Laundry have no desire to cash in on their side gig. Although, Mr. Chang said, he’d be happy if the hundreds of people who have forgotten to pick up their laundry would return to pay their bills. “It would be nice to chat with them,” he said, arching an eyebrow. “And to get paid.” On Thursday morning, for the first time in nearly seven decades, something unusual happened at Wansho Laundry. A customer who had dropped off clothing more than a year ago and saw the couple in the local news finally came back to collect the garments — and to pay the bill.']",
"As Japan Nears 1,000 Daily Coronavirus Infections, It Shies From Restrictions",2020-07-24,By Motoko Rich and Hikari Hida,"['TOKYO — The blame game can go only so far. For weeks, as Japan faced a troubling rise in coronavirus cases, officials pointed fingers at Tokyo’s nightlife districts, especially the so-called host and hostess bars on the periphery of the country’s sex industry. The message was clear: The rest of Japan was still doing fine, so its economic reopening should continue uninterrupted. But that facade is quickly melting away. On Friday, Japan reported close to 1,000 new infections — the most in a single day since the pandemic began — with cases surfacing across the country. This month, clusters have been found in nursing homes, schools and a Tokyo theater. And, in a worrisome sign, an increasing number have no traceable links. Despite the growing outbreaks, the Japanese government has so far resisted a return to the kinds of restrictions being imposed in places like Hong Kong and Australia as their caseloads, which had previously subsided, spiral up again. Tokyo officials — who announced a record total of 366 cases on Thursday — have not asked karaoke bars or nightclubs to close as they did under a state of emergency in April. The central government has pressed ahead with a domestic tourism campaign, although it bowed to pressure to exclude travelers to and from Tokyo. Officials have maintained this no-going-back approach even as the nation reached a total of 27,956 active cases on Friday, a figure nearly 50 percent higher than at the beginning of the month. “We are seeing the early phase of exponential growth,” said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College London and a member of a coronavirus task force assembled by the Japan Medical Association. “If they don’t act promptly and try to contain it as fast as possible,” he said, the virus could spin out of control. When Tokyo announced its record case count on Thursday, Gov. Yuriko Koike acknowledged that infections had been detected across the city and were not limited to the nightlife hot spots that have been the subject of hectoring media coverage. Yet in what business owners describe as scapegoating, the central government and Ms. Koike have talked of dispatching police officers to bars and nightclubs to help monitor social distancing and other hygiene measures. On a balmy night this week in Kabukicho, a nerve center of Tokyo nightlife, Yuto Hara, 21, and his girlfriend, Ami Kaneko, 21, expressed little concern about the possibility of contracting the virus. “I am not worried,” Mr. Hara said as the couple paused on Godzilla Road, the main artery into a neon-lit neighborhood of bars, nightclubs and host and hostess clubs, where young workers are paid to spend time in conversation — and more — with drinking customers. “With young people, there is very little possibility of actually dying.” Part of the reason the government remains sanguine about the uptick in cases is that deaths have remained relatively low: just over 1,000 in a country of close to 127 million people. Japan has been held up as a model of infection control, with most residents wearing masks everywhere. Offices and stores put bottles of hand sanitizer at entrances and make efforts to shield workers and customers behind plastic sheeting. The majority of recent cases — as in other countries that have experienced a rebound in infections — have been among people in their 20s and 30s, who tend to suffer only mild symptoms. On Thursday, Ms. Koike said that about one in seven of the Tokyo cases were asymptomatic. But other indicators are more unsettling. The number of serious cases — patients requiring ventilators — has doubled in less than a week in Tokyo. And experts say that the young may eventually spread the virus to older people and others at risk of getting seriously ill. Now, the virus “is mainly among young populations, but it will shift toward people in their 40s and 50s, and may even end up in the more vulnerable populations such as those in their 70s and 80s,” said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University Hospital. “You can’t really isolate the younger population from elderly people,” he said. This pattern of the young passing the virus on to older populations, Dr. Iwata said, “was evidently seen in many parts of the United States,” where communities opened up and younger people hit the bars, restaurants and beaches, sparking outbreaks. Until recently, Japan has been viewed as something of an outlier in the pandemic. Despite having the world’s highest proportion of elderly people and contending with a severe early outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Japan has puzzled experts as it managed to contain the virus and avoid huge death tolls without imposing strict lockdowns. Some physicians say they see no reason that the latest outbreaks will change that, in part because of the underlying health of the population. “Compared to other countries, we don’t have as many ‘fatties,’” said Dr. Hiroyuki Kunishima, professor of infectious diseases at St. Marianna University School of Medicine in Tokyo. “The people who will have the heaviest conditions after contracting the virus are the fat people, smokers and people with pre-existing conditions.” He said that the seasonal flu was a much bigger concern in Japan. Japan’s obesity rate is about 4 percent, compared to more than 40 percent in the United States. But 18 percent of the adult population in Japan smokes regularly, compared with about 14 percent in the United States. And Japan actually has a slightly higher rate of diabetes, one of the underlying conditions that have been associated with coronavirus morbidity. The Japanese public has grown increasingly concerned about the recent record-setting caseloads. According to a poll by Kyodo News, two-thirds of the public wants the government to impose another state of emergency, under which businesses were asked to restrict operations and people were asked to work from home and make only essential trips. On Friday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said there was no reason for the government to do so again. In some ways, it has gone in the opposite direction. In a speech about the contentious travel campaign this week, Mr. Abe cited the importance of reviving the economy, as the slowdown in international travel has severely hobbled Japan’s tourism industry. The government also announced this month that sports and music venues could allow up to 5,000 people to attend events, as long as capacity was limited to 50 percent. Officials say that the public health authorities can control the spread of the virus by quickly isolating clusters. When a positive case is identified, the patient is asked to list recent contacts, who are then tested. If any of them test positive, they are either hospitalized or asked to quarantine at home for 14 days, if they have a mild case. Dr. Shibuya said that such retrospective testing may have worked in the early days of the pandemic, but that a broader approach was now necessary. Japan has consistently performed tests at well under its stated capacity: It says it can conduct as many as 30,000 a day, but it has more recently conducted fewer than 15,000 on a daily basis, and some days much fewer. Without more testing, “you can’t separate those who are infected from those who are not,” Dr. Shibuya said. “If you delay testing until the onset of major symptoms, it’s too late.” The authorities have stepped up targeted testing in some of the nightlife districts. Kaori Kohga, head of the Nightlife Business Association, which represents hostess clubs, said it was unfair of the government to single out the industry. “I would like to urge politicians, instead of stirring up such divisive ideas, to instead look for fundamental solutions,” Ms. Kohga said. She said national guidelines for how to protect workers and customers were unrealistic, such as asking customers to stay six feet from hostesses or other customers. Many of the clubs, Ms. Kohga said, operate in small spaces and could have no more than two customers at a time under the recommendations. As a result of the negative attention, she said, business has dropped significantly, and some clubs have had to close, throwing employees — many of whom are young women with few other options — out of work. On one evening this week, the normally heaving Kabukicho district was decidedly subdued. At the Orange Terrace Girls Club, which displayed an official sign to certify that the business was implementing infection control measures, a worker standing outside pulled out a fever-checking thermometer from his back pocket. At Kirin City, a bar and restaurant, fewer than half of the tables and bar stools were occupied. “Please refrain from speaking very loudly,” read a sign hanging by the door, reflecting evidence that the virus can be spread that way. Dr. Shibuya said he was worried that the government was downplaying the risks that the country could be facing a more severe contagion. “Japan shouldn’t be so complacent,” he said, “because we have been lucky.”']","Case numbers are climbing fast, with virus clusters in nursing homes, schools and elsewhere.

"Flooding in India Kills Scores of Animals, Including Endangered Rhinos",2020-07-25,By The Associated Press,"['GAUHATI, India — More than 100 animals, including 10 one-horned rhinoceroses, have died in massive flooding at the famed Kaziranga game reserve in northeastern India, officials said. The flooding prompted Britain’s Prince William and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, to express their concern in a letter to park authorities, officials said on Saturday. “Since the first week of June, we are having no respite with wave after wave of flood that has wreaked havoc inside the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve,” said Kaziranga’s park director, P. Sivakumar. He said an animal that had drowned in a swollen river near the park on Saturday brought the death toll of the endangered rhinoceroses up to 10. The British royal couple, known formally as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, wrote to Mr. Sivakumar expressing their distress about the devastation to the park and its precious wildlife. The couple had visited the park in 2016 to learn about conservation and anti-poaching efforts. “The deaths of so many animals, including one-horned rhino, are deeply upsetting,” they wrote. The flooding is the result of a monsoon that has dumped rain across parts of India, Bangladesh and Nepal, displacing 9.6 million people, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. More than 550 people have been killed in the floods, the group said. The organization warned of a humanitarian crisis, saying that close to one third of Bangladesh has already been flooded, with more flooding expected in the coming weeks. It said that 2.8 million people have been affected, and that more than 1 million were isolated. In India, more than 6.8 million people have been affected by the flooding, mainly in the northern states of Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Meghalaya bordering Bangladesh, the group said, citing official figures. In Bihar, at least 10 people have been killed, the state’s disaster management authority said on Saturday. In Assam, home to Kaziranga, 96 people have been killed in floods and another 26 have been killed in mudslides. Some 50,000 people have sought shelter in government-run relief camps.']","The flooding at the famous Kaziranga game reserve has drawn the attention of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who had visited the park to learn about its conservation efforts."
"China Orders U.S. to Shut Chengdu Consulate, Retaliating for Houston",2020-07-24,By Keith Bradsher and Steven Lee Myers,"['BEIJING — As the United States lashed out against the “new tyranny” of China, Beijing on Friday ordered the closure of the American consulate in Chengdu, a retaliatory move that threatens to drive the two powers into an even deeper divide. Beijing blamed the Trump administration for the deterioration in relations, calling its own action justified after Washington told China this week to shutter its consulate in Houston and accused its diplomats of acting illegally. A Chinese official, in turn, denounced American diplomats in Chengdu, a southwestern city, for interfering in China’s affairs.   In the Chinese telling, Beijing is under assault, as the Trump administration goes after it with increasing intensity on trade, technology and human rights. All in a matter of weeks, the United States has sanctioned Chinese officials over the ruling Communist Party’s policies in Hong Kong and the western region of Xinjiang, cut off Chinese companies’ access to American technology and challenged Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea.  The party’s propaganda outlets struck a nationalistic note on Friday, vowing that Beijing would hold firm in the face of mounting pressure from the United States.  “The United States has recently stirred up troubles in relations with China to the point of hysteria,” said the official Xinhua News Agency, in an editorial.  “The unprovoked closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston by the United States not only aroused the indignation of the Chinese people,” the editorial read, “but also allowed the international community to see the true face of American bullying.”  To the Trump administration, China has been the aggressor. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday accused Beijing of exploiting the West’s willingness to engage with the Communist Party. He called on “freedom-loving nations of the world” to band together and “induce China to change.”  It was a speech set against a symbolic backdrop. Mr. Pompeo spoke in California at the library of President Richard M. Nixon, whose visit to China in 1972 set in motion a new era of relations that, he said, disadvantaged the United States.  “If we bend the knee now, our children’s children may be at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party, whose actions are the primary challenge today in the free world,” said Mr. Pompeo, whose reference to the closing of the consulate in Houston was met with applause.  “General Secretary Xi is not destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever unless we allow it,” he added, referring to Xi Jinping, China’s leader. Chinese officials have reacted angrily to the administration, accusing Mr. Pompeo and others of embracing a Cold War mentality. In a tweet on Friday, Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, criticized Mr. Pompeo for “launching a new crusade against China in a globalized world.”  “What he is doing is as futile as an ant trying to shake a tree,” Ms. Hua wrote. Increasingly, both sides are staking out intractable positions from which it would be hard to find common ground.  “Pompeo’s speech is the new Cold War declaration of the United States,” said Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing. “And the world is divided into two: Start anew and carry out all aspects of competition and confrontation with China.”  The concern is that the damage wrought by these recent moves will become increasingly difficult to reverse. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeared aware of this risk even as it announced the closure of the American consulate, suggesting that the United States could help to bring the relationship back on track if it immediately retracted its decision on the Houston consulate.  But the Trump administration has said the closure of the Houston consulate was necessary because it had become a hub of illegal spying and influence operations, allegations that Chinese officials have denied.  Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, accused American diplomats in Chengdu on Friday of engaging in inappropriate activities, without providing examples.  “They interfered in China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s national security interests,” he told reporters at a regular briefing. Within hours of the announcement, the Chengdu consulate became an object of national fascination in China. A live video feed showing the closed front gate of the consulate had been viewed 24 million times by Friday evening on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging service.  Chinese diplomats had been seen burning what appeared to be documents in the courtyard of the Houston consulate after they were ordered to leave, raising speculation in China about whether American diplomats might do the same. The immediate effect of the two consulates’ closures is expected to be minimal, especially since the visas they normally process have become moot at a time when travel has been severely limited by the coronavirus pandemic.  But the closure of the consulate in Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, the westernmost of the five American consulates in mainland China, deprives the United States in a city that is a hub for China’s commercial expansion across Central Asia. Chengdu is also its most valuable diplomatic outpost for gathering information on Xinjiang and Tibet, the two sometimes-restive regions in China’s far west. Both regions have been the locations for wide-ranging security crackdowns that have drawn international criticism as abuses of human rights. Chinese officials have dismissed such concerns as unfair.  The consulate in Chengdu was also briefly at the center of Chinese political intrigue in 2012 when Wang Lijun, the police chief from the nearby metropolis of Chongqing, fled there after a falling-out with his boss, the city’s party leader, Bo Xilai. Mr. Bo was later accused of being at the center of a conspiracy to seize control of the Communist Party.  China had warned earlier this week that it would retaliate for the Houston consulate closure in kind. At the same time, the government appears to have little appetite for an escalation. Global Times, a nationalistic Communist Party newspaper, acknowledged that Chinese leaders faced a dilemma in how to respond.  “Not to fight back will be regarded as weakness, which will lead to a series of consequences and seriously endanger China’s long-term national interests,” the paper said in a commentary. But, it noted, “taking countermeasures every time will force China and the United States to drift farther apart the more they fight, and accelerate their ‘decoupling.’” The editorial said that Beijing ultimately could not afford to be passive: “China’s attitude is very simple, as long as it is a malicious provocation, we will fight back with no exception.” Trump administration officials had accused Chinese diplomats in Houston of aiding economic espionage and the attempted theft of scientific research in numerous cases across the United States. Intelligence operatives from all countries operate out of their embassies and consulates, but with its actions, the administration is accusing the Chinese of going too far, violating American law by lying about their identities in order to operate undercover. A summary of law-enforcement activities against the Chinese in the United States, provided by officials in Washington to The New York Times, depicted a web of covert efforts by the consulate to recruit researchers and others to collect technology and research, including at several of the top medical centers in the greater Houston region. It also detailed a series of F.B.I. investigations across the country, disclosing that the bureau had conducted interrogations in 25 states of people thought to be members of China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army, who were sent to study or conduct research at U.S. universities without disclosing their affiliation. The Justice Department announced on Thursday that four of them had been charged and three arrested. One, identified as Tang Juan, studied at the University of California, Davis, and fled to the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco to escape arrest, according to the document. The standoff between the two governments over her was one of the issues leading to the State Department’s order to the Chinese ambassador on Tuesday to shut down its Houston consulate. Ms. Tang left the San Francisco consulate on Thursday night and was placed under arrest, a Justice Department official said Friday, and she was expected to appear in court. The official said the closing of the Houston consulate was as much about sending a message to all the Chinese missions and the Chinese government about their activities as it was about the Houston consulate itself. Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul, South Korea. Edward Wong contributed reporting from Washington and Cao Li from Hong Kong.

Scandal and Infighting Erupt Within India’s Ailing Congress Party,2020-07-23,By Kai Schultz and Suhasini Raj,"['JAIPUR, India — As the once-formidable Indian National Congress party began to crumble in recent years, Sachin Pilot, a young, well-connected politician, stepped up to help his bloc weather one crisis after another. Mr. Pilot’s parents were Congress stalwarts and served in elite government positions. He is close with members of the Gandhi family, who have controlled the party for decades, dominating India’s electorate until Prime Minister Narendra Modi first swept into office six years ago on a wave of Hindu nationalism. Many thought Mr. Pilot, 42, who represented Congress as deputy chief minister in the northern state of Rajasthan, had the perfect résumé to lead the party to a rebirth. Instead, India’s political establishment has been jolted by accusations this month that Mr. Pilot was secretly working on behalf of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, possibly in an effort to depose a chief minister he had fallen out with. Mr. Pilot has denied those accusations. Congress loyalists fear the scandal is another severe blow to the survival of the party, which led the country to independence more than 70 years ago but has been cracking internally under the weight of huge Bharatiya Janata Party victories led by Mr. Modi. Party officials in Rajasthan immediately called for dozens of Congress politicians to move into a hotel in a desperate effort to keep them from defecting. As the country’s political discourse has been dominated by nationalism and Hindu-centric policies, many also worry that the weakness of Congress, which traditionally has championed minorities, harms India’s democracy more broadly. The scandal broke out in recent days when party officials accused Mr. Pilot of offering multimillion-dollar bribes to fellow Congress leaders and urging them to defect to the Bharatiya Janata Party over a period of several months. The fallout was swift and unforgiving. Party leadership removed Mr. Pilot from his post and accused 18 other politicians of colluding with him. Ashok Gehlot, the chief minister in Rajasthan, called his deputy a “worthless person” and released audiotapes that he said implicated Mr. Pilot in a conspiracy to buy off officials “like goats in a market.” “Speaking good English, giving good quotes and being handsome isn’t everything,” Mr. Gehlot told reporters. Mr. Pilot, who did not respond to requests from The New York Times for comment, maintained his innocence in an interview with India Today, insisting that he had no intention of joining the Bharatiya Janata Party. He accused Mr. Gehlot of trying to “humiliate me” and block him from a bigger role in the Congress party. It was one of the most public expressions yet of resentment within Congress that the party is failing to make room for a younger group of leaders to emerge. The upshot is that Mr. Modi’s party is stronger than ever.Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University, said Congress has failed to give incentives to officials to stick with the party, leading some to “seek greener pastures.” In recent years, dozens of senior Congress leaders have left the party, fed up with a lack of visionary leadership. Mr. Modi’s B.J.P. has seized on the turmoil, steadily undermining Congress in the few states that it still controls. In Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, another Congress star who was close to the Gandhis and came from a long line of princes, defected to the B.J.P. in March, causing Congress to lose its fragile hold on the state government. In an interview, Satish Poonia, the president of the B.J.P. in Rajasthan, said “all of the allegations against us are false.” Instead, he described the conflict as a bitter generational rift between Mr. Pilot and older Congress leaders like Mr. Gehlot, 69 — a view also shared by many within Congress.  India has a long history of power grabs and high-level defections, and local news outlets have published accounts from unnamed B.J.P. officials in Rajasthan describing a political coup attempt gone awry, with a disgruntled Mr. Pilot at its center. Rajasthan is a large, politically competitive state, and home to some of India’s vital heritage and cultural sites. Congress controls 107 seats in the state legislature, barely enough to form a majority government. Just a few crossovers would shift the balance of power to the B.J.P. Congress leaders in Rajasthan are deeply rattled. Last week, Mr. Gehlot’s government moved more than 100 elected officials into the Fairmont Hotel, a five-star resort in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, hoping to prevent them from leaving for the B.J.P. The fear was that if the lawmakers remained at home, it would be easier to bribe or entice them to defect. On a recent day this week, riot buses and police officers dressed in camouflage blocked the resort’s entrance. Inside, politicians attended yoga classes and watched Bollywood movies in a marble-floored lobby. Rafeek Khan, a member of Rajasthan’s Legislative Assembly who is among those staying at the hotel, said he had no idea when they would be allowed to leave. “The B.J.P. is playing with democracy,” he said. “They think one can be bought if enough money is offered. That is the message the B.J.P. is sending to the electorate.” In the coming days, Rajasthan’s legislature is expected to decide whether Mr. Pilot and the 18 other rebel officials will lose their seats, which would make forming a new government under the B.J.P. much tougher. The decline of Congress accelerated last year, when Rahul Gandhi, the great-grandson of India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, resigned from his post as president after a humiliating general election defeat against Mr. Modi. Many Indians see the Congress party as a protector of the nation’s founding secular values, but far too beholden to the Gandhis, who are often perceived as a symbol of India’s Anglicized upper class. Mr. Gandhi, his mother, Sonia, who assumed the role of interim president, and his sister, Priyanka, all still call the party’s shots. Mr. Modi continually hammers Congress for being a family dynasty, and his party’s embrace of a brawny Hindu nationalism that emphasizes India’s Hindu heritage has tracked well with voters. Rasheed Kidwai, a former journalist who wrote a book about Sonia Gandhi, said Congress simply could not compete. “They are going through the motions,” he said. “They are very demoralized. They don’t have any hope.” Analysts say trouble has been brewing for Congress in Rajasthan since 2018, when the party scored a victory over the B.J.P. in state elections and retook control of the state government after five years in the opposition. In his interview with India Today, Mr. Pilot said he proposed himself as chief minister, citing his role in helping secure that win. But he ultimately relented to an agreement to take the second spot behind Mr. Gehlot under the impression that he would soon be elevated. Mr. Pilot, whose name comes from the fact that his father was a decorated combat pilot, apparently felt sidelined by Mr. Gehlot, and bitterness between the men grew. “This was a badly handled show and one more state could slip out of Congress’ hands,” said Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst in New Delhi. “It is a failure of national leadership.” Hari Kumar and Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from New Delhi.']","Sachin Pilot, a prominent Congress politician, has been sidelined after being accused of bribing members to defect to Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party."
Cracking Open a Bottle of Calgary’s Past,2020-07-24,By Ian Austen,"['For part of each week, I help put together The Times’s live briefing on the pandemic, which continues to ravage the United States and cause worrying outbreaks in Canada, where things are otherwise significantly better. But the pandemic isn’t all grim destruction. It’s inspiring new interests and resurrecting some too. That’s currently the case in Calgary, where one man’s fascination with a remnant of the city’s past has captured its imagination. It began late last month when Paul Fairie’s plans for a walk were thwarted by rain. Stuck inside, Mr. Fairie, a researcher and political science instructor at the University of Calgary, revisited one of his hobbies: reading old newspapers online. The front page of the Calgary Weekly Herald from September 28, 1883 started off its local news section with a cryptic entry of one simple word: “Cronk.” The mystery didn’t stop there. Sprinkled throughout the front page — like the repetitive ads that clutter 21st-century web pages — there were several more entries, including “Dr. Cronk,” “Cronk is Good,” “Buy Cronk,” “Cronk is the drink” and “Cronk is made at the Star Bakery.” Dr. Fairie had come across very brief ads inserted into articles many times before. But these one-word ads intrigued him. “What really drew my eye was the one that was just ‘Cronk’,” he told me. “I was like, This really isn’t enough detail at all.” Dr. Fairie doesn’t just read old newspapers, he also frequently posts oddities from them on Twitter. They have included a salad recipe that uses four doughnuts as its principal ingredient. So onto Twitter went Cronk. “I thought people would like it and that would be the end of it in an hour,” Dr. Fairie said. He had badly underestimated the power of Cronk. First, Dr. Fairie started receiving bits of Cronk lore from antique bottle collectors, an avid group that was well-versed in Cronk packaging if not the beverage itself. Someone sent Dr. Fairie a recipe for “Dr. Cronk’s Sarsaparilla Beer” through Twitter. He didn’t make it. Requiring 100 gallons of water, the recipe was for Cronk on an industrial scale rather than for anyone’s kitchen. But as the Cronk discussion grew this month, Dr. Fairie made it his pandemic project as he began piecing together all he could find out about the long-forgotten drink. He put all of that into a 16 minute video that some have praised as the finest YouTube offering by a Canadian about a forgotten 19th-century beverage. Here’s the brief version: Cronk appears to have been created in 1839 by Warren Cronk, a soda water maker from Albany, N.Y. Within nine years, he had franchised his creation across much of North America. By the time the enigmatic ads appeared in the Calgary Weekly Herald, Dr. Fairie said that the company was most likely headed by another Warren Cronk, probably the founder’s son. The second Warren Cronk was also in the soda water trade and lived mainly in my hometown, Windsor, Ontario, although he sometimes bounced across the river to Detroit. It’s unclear if either of them had even the slightest claim to the title of doctor. You’ll have to watch Dr. Fairie’s video to learn about Cronk’s role in the Hippodrome War of 1853. There’s not enough space here. Calgary did indeed have a Star Bakery for about a decade and it marked its loaves with stars. From what Dr. Fairie can gather, Frank Claxton, the owner, was also an unsuccessful municipal political candidate who eventually left town. The original age of Cronk appears to have ended around 1910, more than a century before the new one dawned. Dr. Fairie’s digital news clippings have led to the creation of a Cronk T-shirt, which is being sold to raise money for a charity. Perhaps more important, the drink is being resurrected. A microbrewery in Calgary’s Inglewood neighborhood is brewing 800 liters of it, using the somewhat vague recipe Dr. Fairie received. Blake Belding, the head brewer at Cold Garden Brewery, told me that in his quest to revive the drink he will have to use a substitute for sassafras and sarsaparilla. After buying several pounds of the items, he found that food safety laws now ban them as possible carcinogens. A neighborhood spice shop helped him concoct alternatives. It will take another two to three weeks for the Cronk to fully ferment to eliminate any danger that its bottles will explode, Mr. Belding said. His preliminary taste test results are not wholly encouraging. “It’s not bad,"" he said. “I don’t know if it’s something I would crush a 12-pack of on the weekend.” And what does Dr. Fairie hope to find when he cracks open his first bottle of Cronk next month? “I’m hoping it’s either a 10 out of 10 or a zero out of 10,” he said. “The worst case scenario would be that it would be kind of boring.” Cronk. To the surprise of many in the art world, the longtime director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts was dismissed by its board. The debate over why Nathalie Bondil was let go has led to such confusion and rancor that the government has stepped in to investigate. The Federal Court has ruled that a treaty with the United States that allows Canada to turn away asylum seekers coming from the United States if they entered there from a third country violates the constitution, my colleague Dan Bilefsky wrote.

"Brazil’s Bolsonaro, Leading Virus Skeptic, Says He’s No Longer Infected",2020-07-25,By Ernesto Londoño,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said Saturday that he had been cured of the coronavirus, appearing to have suffered only mild symptoms from a scourge he has repeatedly downplayed even as it rippled through the country, killing more than 86,000 people. “GOOD MORNING EVERYONE,” Mr. Bolsonaro, 65, posted in a message on Twitter Saturday morning, with the news that his latest coronavirus test had come back negative. The message included a photo of the president in which he appears to be smiling and giving a thumbs up while brandishing a box of hydroxychloroquine pills, the anti-malaria medicine. Mr. Bolsonaro has hailed the drug as a miracle cure, despite a growing scientific consensus that it is not effective to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Mr. Bolsonaro said he experienced body aches and a fever in the days before he first tested positive for the virus on July 7. Since then, he has projected an image of vitality as he roamed the grounds of the presidential residence in Brasília, at times playing with large birds that live on the estate. Shortly after announcing the test result, Mr. Bolsonaro left the palace riding a motorcycle, accompanied by security aides. He posed for photos with supporters before heading to a motorcycle shop. Mr. Bolsonaro’s cavalier handling of the pandemic has contributed to a national response that public health experts regard as one of the worst in the world. He sabotaged quarantine measures imposed by governors by attending rallies, shaking hands in public and urging Brazilians to continue working. The president called the virus a “measly cold” and said he had little to fear in the event that he became infected because his “athletic background” would enable him to bounce back quickly. Soon after his diagnosis, some Brazilians who are critical of the president expressed hope that he would suffer serious complications, and a few openly said they hoped it would kill him. Yet, the president’s seemingly mild case is vindicating his approach, in the eyes of supporters. “The president’s test results are back,” an allied lawmaker, Carlos Jordy, wrote on Twitter. “Positive for re-elected president in 2022.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s effusive promotion of hydroxychloroquine in social media posts during his recovery made it seem at times as if he was starring in an infomercial for the drug, which has been among the biggest flash points in Brazil’s chaotic response to the pandemic. On Friday a photo of the president appearing to offer hydroxychloroquine to one of the emu-like birds in his garden became the subject of memes. But many in Brazil find little humor in the president’s social media antics as the pandemic continues to kill hundreds of people daily and the economy sputters. As of Saturday, according to the Brazilian government, the country had 2.39 million confirmed cases and more than 86,449 deaths attributable to the virus, second only to the United States, which has 4.1 million cases and more than 145,000 deaths.']","President Jair M.

Protests Swell in Russia’s Far East in a Stark New Challenge to Putin,2020-07-25,By Anton Troianovski,"['KHABAROVSK, Russia — Watching the passing masses of protesters chanting “Freedom!” and “Putin resign!” while passing drivers honked, applauded and offered high-fives, a sidewalk vendor selling little cucumbers and plastic cups of forest raspberries said she would join in, too, if she did not have to work. “There will be a revolution,” the vendor, Irina Lukasheva, 56, predicted. “What did our grandfathers fight for? Not for poverty or for the oligarchs sitting over there in the Kremlin.” The protests in Khabarovsk, a city 4,000 miles east of Moscow, drew tens of thousands of people for a three-mile march through central streets for the third straight week on Saturday. Residents were rallying in support of a popular governor arrested and spirited to Moscow this month — but their remarkable outpouring of anger, which has little precedent in post-Soviet Russia, has emerged as stark testimony to the discontent that President Vladimir V. Putin faces across the country. Mr. Putin won a tightly scripted referendum less than four weeks ago that rewrote the Constitution to allow him to stay in office until 2036. But the vote, seen as fraudulent by critics and many analysts, provided little but a fig leaf for public disenchantment with corruption, stifled freedoms and stagnant incomes made worse by the pandemic. “When a person lives not knowing how things are supposed to be, he thinks things are good,” said Artyom Aksyonov, 31, who is in the transportation business and who was handing out water from the trunk of his car to protesters under the baking sun in Lenin Square, on the protest route. “But when you open your eyes to the truth, you realize things were not good. This was all an illusion.” Across Russia, fear of being detained by the police and the seeming hopelessness of effecting change has largely kept people off the streets. Many Russians also say that whatever Mr. Putin’s faults, the alternative could be worse or lead to greater chaos. For the most part, anti-Kremlin protests have been limited to a few thousand people in Moscow and other big cities, where the authorities usually crack down harshly. Partly as a result, Mr. Putin remains firmly in control. And independent polling shows he still enjoys a 60 percent approval rating, though the figure has been falling. But the events in Khabarovsk have shown that the well of discontent is such that minor events can ignite a firestorm. The weekend crowds have been so large that the police have not tried to control them — even though the protesters did not have a permit, let alone a clear leader or organizer. And with Russians switching en masse from television, which is controlled by the government, to the largely uncensored internet to get their news, the state can easily lose its grip on the narrative. Khabarovsk, a city of 600,000 close to the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Chinese border, had not seen any protests of much significance since the early 1990s. That changed after July 9, when a SWAT team dragged the governor, Sergei I. Furgal, out of his car and whisked him to Moscow on 15-year-old murder accusations. Khabarovsk social media forums erupted in indignation over an arrest that looked like a Kremlin move to eliminate a young and well-liked politician who had upset an ally of Mr. Putin in the regional election in 2018. Tens of thousands spontaneously poured into the streets on July 11 as residents called for protests online, and they re-emerged in greater numbers on July 18. Smaller-scale marches through the city continued daily. Russian journalists who have been following the protests since the beginning said Saturday’s crowds were the biggest yet. Opposition activists estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 had turned out. City officials said that about 6,500 people had attended, clearly an undercount. As they have on previous weekends, the protesters gathered in the central Lenin Square by the headquarters of the regional government. They marched down a main street, blocking traffic, and made a three-mile loop through the city center before returning to the square. Police officers walked along casually on the sidewalk, without interfering. The crowd, some of whom wore face masks stenciled with Mr. Furgal’s name, looked like a cross section of the city, including working-class and middle-class residents, pensioners and young people. The most concrete demand in their chants was that Mr. Furgal face trial in Khabarovsk rather than in Moscow, but they did not shy away from challenging Mr. Putin directly. They shouted “Shame on the Kremlin!”, “Russia, wake up!” and “We are the ones in power!” Mr. Putin last Monday appointed a 39-year-old politician from outside the region, Mikhail V. Degtyarev, as the acting governor of the Khabarovsk region, angering residents further. Asked whether he would meet with the protesters, Mr. Degtyarev told reporters that he had better things to do than talk to people “screaming outside the windows.” The Kremlin appears determined to wait the protests out. The regional authorities have warned that they could worsen the spread of the pandemic, announcing on Saturday a sharp rise in coronavirus infections and noting that medical equipment and personnel had arrived from Moscow to aid local hospitals. One of the protesters, Vadim Serzhantov, a 35-year-old railway company employee, said he had held little interest in politics until recently. The arrest of Mr. Furgal, whom residents praise for populist moves such as cutting back on officials’ perks, was a turning point, Mr. Serzhantov said. “To be honest, I used to not care at all,” Mr. Serzhantov said. “But this is lawlessness.”']","Demonstrations in the city of Khabarovsk drew tens of thousands for the third straight weekend. The anger, fueled by the arrest of a popular governor, has little precedent in modern Russia."
"For French-Algerian Families, Virus Disrupts Cherished Summer Ritual",2020-07-26,By Constant Méheut,"['TOULOUSE, France — Sitting around a table strewn with steaming cups of mint tea, a dozen women were sharing memories of their summer holidays in their homeland, Algeria. Malika Haï recalled sweltering days spent with her cousins near the beaches. Samia Tran described the cheerful family dinners around traditional dishes. And Zohra Benkebane, almost an hour into the conversation, was the first to burst into tears. “We all have a lump in our throats,” Ms. Tran said as she hugged her sobbing friend. “It’s too hard. We need to go home.” For many French citizens of Algerian descent whose families migrated across the Mediterranean in the second half of the 20th century, summer holidays in Algeria are a deep-rooted tradition. Every year thousands of people venture off toward what they commonly call the “bled” — a word derived from Arabic that refers to the countryside. “Leaving for the bled is a form of holiday routine,” said Jennifer Bidet, a sociologist at the Paris Descartes University who estimated, based on official statistics, that 82 percent of French people of Algerian origin had spent at least one holiday in Algeria during childhood, while 34 percent returned every year. But with the Covid-19 pandemic still raging, Algeria is keeping its borders tightly closed until further notice. That effectively forbids vacations that had become a cornerstone of the cross-cultural identity of many French-Algerian families, much to their dismay. “Holidays in the bled are a cultural bridge,” said Mustapha Benzitouni, a 45-year-old French-Algerian. “It allows people to rediscover an identity through their parents, through their belonging to a people, through their belonging to a culture.” Perhaps nowhere has the Algerian travel ban been felt more acutely than in Toulouse, a city of about 500,000 people in southwestern France that was shaped by waves of immigration. Hundreds of Toulouse families of Algerian descent are now stranded at home, unable to afford, or simply unwilling, to spend summer vacations anywhere but Algeria. “It’s sacred for us to leave,” said Ms. Haï, 58, who, like many Algerians of her generation, mixed Arabic and French when speaking. “During a normal summer, in July and August, the neighborhood goes completely empty.” The neighborhood to which Ms. Haï referred is Le Mirail, an impoverished area outside the city center that is plagued by drug trafficking and where about 30,000 people live in dreary apartment blocks. A large majority of the residents come from Algeria, with other families from Morocco and Tunisia, who also often visit their homelands in France’s former North African colonies in July and August. Unlike Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia have recently reopened their borders to tourists and their citizens living abroad, meaning some of Le Mirail’s residents can go ahead with their summer plans. For Algerians, though, the travel ban means parents need to come up with alternative plans for idle children. “Spending the summer here is impossible, there’s hardly anything to do,” said Djelloul Zitouni, 38, a father of three who was playing with his children on a small playground nestled in the middle of Le Mirail. Like every year, Mr. Zitouni — who migrated to France from Algeria 14 years ago to work as a driver — had planned on spending August in his hometown, the coastal city of Oran. “Eleven months of hard work for one month of dreams,” he said. This year Mr. Zitouni said he would try to “get by with the children,” taking them to the local swimming pool and a few days at the seaside. Worried that bored teenagers could lead to trouble, local community groups and the authorities have tried to alleviate the doldrums by organizing activities in Le Mirail. On a recent afternoon, dozens of families, mostly of Algerian heritage, gathered on large plots of grass bordering a small lake in the neighborhood to take part in painting workshops, water games and dance classes. But Soraya Amalou, a volunteer, had no illusions that these activities could make up for the loss of a genuine summer escape. “Spending holidays here means no holidays. In this neighborhood, you suffer from tiny apartments, from insecurity, you suffer from everything,” she said. By contrast, summer vacations in Algeria, which Ms. Haï likened to a “breath of fresh air,” are much anticipated all year long, and the rituals leading up to the trip — from the tickets booked well in advance to the suitcases filled with presents for the cousins — have shaped several migrant generations. The French colonization of Algeria, which lasted from 1830 to 1962, forged lasting, yet complex, ties between the two nations, which Benjamin Stora, a historian of Algeria, described as a “very special relationship of both hatred and fascination.” Mr. Stora said that “returning to the bled” was a way for French-Algerians to “reconnect with a national filiation.” But while French-Algerians can be made to feel like they don’t fully fit in with France, they also “are badly regarded in Algeria,” Mr. Stora said, where they are seen as French citizens whose Algerian heritage is but a detail. “They treat us like French bourgeois and raise prices as soon as we arrive,” said Ahmed Adjelout, 72, who was waiting in a travel agency in downtown Toulouse in the hope of rescheduling his July 22 flight to Oran, which had just been canceled. Mr. Adjelout, a retiree with a beret thrust upon his head, recalled how he would be called “an emigrant, a stranger” by Algerians whenever he returned to the country he left in 1967. “The paradox,” Mr. Adjelout added, “is that in Algeria, we’re seen as French and in France, we’re seen as Algerians.” This ambiguous situation — straddling two cultures and belonging to neither — can make building an identity a challenge for the estimated 2.5 million people of Algerian descent in France, especially for second- and third-generation immigrants for whom Algeria is merely a summer getaway. “It’s tricky to deal with both sides, the French and the Algerian, no culture really welcomes us,” said Fatiha Zelmat, whose mother, Naouel Matti, has taken her to the ancient stone alleys of Algiers, the Algerian capital, every summer since she was born — except this year. Ms. Zelmat, 21, said she had fond memories of her time in Algeria, but she also condemned a more conservative culture that forbids women from smoking or wearing shorts. “I have mixed feelings about Algeria,” she said. Ms. Bidet, the sociologist, said that for some young people, spending holidays in Algeria — where they can afford activities that would be far beyond their means in France — is an opportunity to escape the poor social status to which they are normally relegated. But, she noted, this reversal of social hierarchies is only temporary and does nothing to address the problems of integration they face in France. Ms. Matti, who covered her hair with an elegant white veil, said that young people of Algerian descent like her daughter were integrated neither in Algeria nor in France, where they often grow up in deeply socially segregated neighborhoods like Le Mirail. “Our children stop going to Algeria because they don’t feel they belong there,” Ms. Matti said. “But where will they go instead?”']","Holidays in Algeria are a cornerstone of the cross-cultural identity of many French people with roots there. This year, they are stuck at home, and the pain is acute: “It’s sacred for us to leave.”"
"Of Wine, Hand Sanitizer and Heartbreak",2020-07-27,By Adam Nossiter,"['HUNAWIHR, France — The tanker-truck pulled up and it was time to let it go. The decision to send the wine to the distillery had been made weeks ago. It still hurt. Soon the wine would be sanitizing hand gel. “We’ve got to load it up now,” said Jérôme Mader, a 38-year-old winemaker, muttering to himself. “OK, I am not even going to think about it anymore,” he said quietly. “It’s over.” Head down, he dragged the hoses out through his shed, affixed them to the truck’s valves with the help of the driver, walked up to his cool cellar, and turned on the pumps. The wine — good Alsace white wine, drinkable wine — coursed through the hoses and into the truck’s belly. Its fate didn’t bear thinking about. Across the emerald Alsace wine country, now carpeted in deep-green vines — and across France’s other wine regions as well — thousands of winemakers, famous and obscure, are facing similar moments of heartbreak. The economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus, combined with the Trump administration’s 25 percent tax on French wines in the trade war dispute with Europe, has collapsed the wine market. Mr. Mader, whose high-quality Rieslings and Gewürztraminers are sent to fancy restaurants and shops on both sides of the Atlantic, has lost half his sales since December. “Covid is a catastrophe for us,” he said. And so some of the succulent and subtle white wine for which this region is famous, nurtured on the stony, sunbathed Alsace slopes, will wind up as hand sanitizer. Like other winemakers, Mr. Mader has no room in his cellar to stock unsold wine. “We can’t keep stocking what we haven’t sold,” he said. The precocious 2020 harvest, blessed by abundant sunshine, is barely a month away. The wine vats must be emptied for the new production. The distillery, for modest compensation, is the only option. The driver from the distillery had been making the rounds of winemakers all morning. “Some of them are taking this quite badly, because this wine has commercial value,” the driver, Lucas Neret, noted dryly. “We’re producing more than we can sell,” said Thibaut Specht, a winemaker in nearby Mittelwihr. “We have no choice.” Marion Borès’s family business, Domaine Borès, in Reichsfeld, is sending 30 percent of its production — 19,000 liters. “It’s like you are saying goodbye to somebody who is very dear to you,” she said. “This is not exactly the destination we had in mind, when we made this wine,” the 27-year-old winemaker added. The old wine is ending up in the towering steel silos of the nearby Romann distillery, where it will be boiled down to alcohol. In Alsace alone, over six million liters of wine, or about 1.5 million gallons, will end up like this. Mr. Mader is sending 15 percent of his production, wine he calls “Edelzwicker,” or “noble blend” in Alsatian dialect. Usually sold wholesale, “it’s still pretty good,” Mr. Mader said. At the distillery, the odor of boiled-down wine, like the essence of a rich beef burgundy sauce, hung heavy over the establishment on a warm morning this week. “We’re continuously distilling,” said Erwin Brouard, the company’s director. “It’s something that’s very sad for the winemakers. Their stocks are too big. They’ve got to make space. And the harvest is early this year.” The French government, anxious to protect its precious wine heritage, is subsidizing the operation, compensating the some 5,000 winemakers who have signed up so far at a fraction of the wine’s value, less than $1 per liter, in what the government calls Crisis Distillation. “My cellar is bursting, ”said Guillaume Klauss, who owns a nearby winery. “If I don’t send it off, I don’t eat. Clearly this is tearing me up. It’s three years of work, and we’re not even paid properly.” Alsace is having to resort to Crisis Distillation for the first time in its history although it is not unknown in other wine regions. The last time this happened was in 2009, after the financial collapse. “A very big majority have been battered by this crisis,” said Francis Backert, head of the Independent Winemakers Association of Alsace. “These people are really hurting.” he said. “All the outlets are blocked,” he added. “Export is blocked. Trump, Covid. There’s very little going on outside France. The American market, blocked.” Wholesale wine traders are facing losses of 70 percent, he said. But the monetary losses are one thing. There is also the psychological blow. “Look, these people have a great deal of circumspection, and shame,” Mr. Backert said. “They just don’t want to talk about it. Obviously, this is breaking their heart.” Some winemakers in the region refused to be interviewed on the subject. The relationship to their vines, and what is produced from them, is personal as much as financial. Many live in modest houses, carrying on a family trade that often goes back centuries. The date carved above the original Borès cellar is 1723. On the sun-battered schist and sandstone slopes above Reichsfeld, Ms. Borès patrolled vines she has worked in since the age of 10, plucking out dead leaves and pulling shriveled grapes. Her touch was light. “These are vines that we fuss over the whole year round,” said her mother, Marie-Claire. “We do everything by hand. And now, this. Terrible.” Climbing the steep slope, Marion said, “We played in these vines,” adding that she takes part in the harvest herself. “The schist is magical,” she said. “It is what makes the wine dynamic. There are moments when you are really glad to be alone in these vines.” In his career, Mr. Mader has won prizes, and has faced the opposite problem he has today — not having enough wine to satisfy demand. “To have imagined, a few years ago, that a truck would be passing by one day … it’s unimaginable,” he said, his voice trailing off. For days he put off making a decision about the distillery. “I hesitated,” he said. “I thought we would get over it. I waited until the last day to decide. I always think the next day will be better.” But the decision couldn’t be postponed; the government was pressing with its sign-up deadline. Afterward, to console himself and colleagues, he said, “I called up a friend and we drank a couple of bottles.” “As long as the wine is good, there is always hope,” he added. Orders have recently picked up, a little. Besides, “the grapes this year are truly magnificent,” he said.']","Between the coronavirus and the Trump tariffs, the French wine market has collapsed. So winemakers are — sadly — sending their excess product off to another life as hand sanitizer."
Israel Says It Thwarted a Hezbollah Raid at Lebanon Border,2020-07-27,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Monday that it had thwarted a raid by a Hezbollah “terrorist squad” in a disputed area along its northern border with Lebanon, resulting in an exchange of fire that capped days of mounting tension there. An Israeli military spokesman said that a small squad armed with assault rifles had crossed an unfenced section of the boundary into Israel by a few yards. Israeli forces responded, firing small arms, tank guns and then artillery, the spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said. The squad fled back into Lebanon, he said, and then fired back at Israel. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization, denied that there had been an exchange of fire, saying the only firing had come from the Israeli side. “Everything that the enemy’s media is claiming in terms of foiling an infiltration operation” is “absolutely not true,” Hezbollah said in a statement. “It is an attempt to invent false and mythical victories.” No casualties were reported by either side. Israel had been bracing for retaliation from Hezbollah since the killing of one of its operatives in a strike in Syria last week that was attributed to Israel. Hezbollah said Monday that retaliation was still coming, as well as retaliation for the shelling on Monday. Lebanese television reported shelling near the Lebanese village of Kafr Shuba. “The Zionists only need to continue waiting for the punishment for their crimes,” the Hezbollah statement said. On Monday afternoon, amid preliminary reports of explosions, smoke and cross-border fire, the Israeli military instructed residents of northern Israel to remain indoors and closed roads in the area. But the restrictions were lifted less than two hours later, a sign that calm had been restored and an apparent indication that Israel did not intend to prolong the confrontation. The events took place in the vicinity of Shebaa Farms — known in Israel as Mount Dov — a strip claimed by Israel, Lebanon and sometimes Syria near the intersection of all three nations and adjacent to the Golan Heights. Israel’s defense minister, Benny Gantz, had visited the northern border on Sunday as anticipation of a retaliatory attack by Hezbollah grew. Syria’s state-run news agency, SANA, reported that Israeli aircraft had fired rockets toward southern Damascus last Monday night, July 20. Though Israel rarely takes responsibility publicly for specific strikes, it has acknowledged carrying out scores of attacks aimed, it says, at preventing the transfer of sophisticated weapons from Iran to Hezbollah via Syria. After last week’s strike on an ammunition depot near the Damascus airport, Hezbollah said that one of its operatives, Ali Kamel Mohsen, was killed in an act of “Zionist aggression.” The killing appeared to violate informal rules of engagement between Israel and Hezbollah. In recent years, Hezbollah has refrained from killing Israelis while Israel has largely avoided killing Hezbollah fighters in Syria. Both sides want to press their points while avoiding a war that could devastate Lebanon and Israel. In a television interview on Sunday, Naim Qassem, the deputy secretary general of Hezbollah, described the Hezbollah fighter killed in Syria as a martyr and said the group would uphold the rules of engagement. “The deterrence equation with Israel is standing,” he said on the Arabic news channel Al Mayadeen. “Amending or changing the rules of engagement or the deterrence equation are not on our agenda.” Israel contends that Hezbollah, with Iran’s help, is trying to build a fleet of precision-guided missiles, which Israel considers a red line. Last August, an Israeli drone struck a building near Beirut that Israeli officials said contained machinery for making those missiles. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that officials were closely monitoring the situation in the north. “Hezbollah needs to know that it’s playing with fire,” he said. “Every attack against us will be answered with great might.” He said that Israel “will not allow Iran to entrench itself militarily on our border with Syria” and warned that “Lebanon and Hezbollah will bear responsibility for any attack” originating from Lebanese territory. Israel and Hezbollah fought a devastating, monthlong war in 2006. There have only been sporadic clashes across the Israel-Lebanon border in recent years. Monday’s events came as many Israelis, largely barred from traveling abroad because of a spike in coronavirus infections, were vacationing in the north. Adam Rasgon contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Vivian Yee from Beirut.']",The Israeli military says it repelled a raid by Hezbollah in a disputed area along its northern border.

Strange Bedfellows: Iran’s Ex-President Woos Saudi Crown Prince as Pen Pal,2020-07-26,By Farnaz Fassihi,"['A former president of Iran, known in the West for speeches that assert the Holocaust was invented and that Israel should be erased from the map, has written a chummy letter to his country’s most ardent Arab foe: the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. So far, at least, it appears to be a one-way exchange. Nonetheless, the letter by the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is striking in that Mr. Ahmadinejad wrote it at all. Other members of Iran’s hierarchy, led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have described the 34-year-old crown prince, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, as adventurous, brutal and immature. And for his part, the crown prince has compared Ayatollah Khamenei to Hitler and called any engagement with Iran useless. Flouting Iran’s stated policy toward Saudi Arabia, Mr. Ahmadinejad sent the letter, filled with flattery and praise, to the crown prince this month, inviting him to join hands to end the Yemen war, according to a copy that Mr. Ahmadinejad’s office provided to The New York Times. Portraying the crown prince as a man of peace, the letter asserted that he would take steps to bring peace to the region and thus secure his legacy and please Islam’s prophet, Muhammad. The letter made no mention of the crown prince’s prosecution of the five-year-old war in Yemen, which the United Nations calls the world’s biggest manmade humanitarian disaster. “I know that your excellency is not happy about the current situation of innocent people dying and getting injured every day and infrastructure being damaged,” the letter said. “You are upset that regional resources belonging to the people are used for destruction instead of developing peace and prosperity. For these reasons you will welcome a just peace.” It was signed, “your brother Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.” The Saudis have portrayed the Yemen conflict as essentially a battle with Iran, which supports the Houthi rebels who routed the Saudi-backed Yemen government from vast swaths of the country in 2015.  Saudi Arabia has not yet responded to Mr. Ahmadinejad’s letter, which was delivered to the Saudi interest office in Tehran, according to his office. The Saudi mission to the United Nations did not respond to an inquiry about whether the crown prince had received the letter. The Yemen war reflects a far deeper rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which have been locked in a rivalry over which nation should take a leadership role in the global Islamic community. In recent years tensions have escalated and diplomatic relations have broken down between the two countries.  “The Saudi government is despotic, dictatorial, corrupt, tyrannical and dependent,” Ayatollah Khamenei inveighed in a speech in 2019, expressing confidence that the ruling Al Saud dynasty would collapse in the near future at the hands of Islamic revolutionaries. Mr. Ahmadinejad also wrote to the leader of the Houthis, Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi, and to the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres. The three letters represent a proposal by Mr. Ahmadinejad to mediate an end to Yemen’s war by creating a committee of international dignitaries. Mr. Guterres’s spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said he had no knowledge of the letter. A spokesman for Iran’s mission to the United Nations, Alireza Miryusefi, sought to play down Mr. Ahmadinejad’s attempts at independent diplomacy. “His views, as long as he remains a private citizen like many other Iranians, have no relation to the government and administration policies at this moment,” Mr. Miryusefi said. Mr. Ahmadinejad is not without influence in Iran. He holds a seat on the Expediency Council, an appointed body that is supposed to supervise all branches of the government. He routinely travels around Iran giving campaign-style speeches and appears to have a sizable segment of followers. Unlike many of his counterparts who faced jail and house arrest for criticizing the regime, he has so far been unconstrained. Diplomats and analysts said it was highly unlikely that Mr. Ahmadinejad’s outreach to the Saudi crown prince would lead to any further engagement. Some saw it as a bid for relevance by Mr. Ahmadinejad as Iran faces many challenges, most notably from American sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic. Roozbeh Mirebrahimi, an independent Iran analyst based in New York, said the crown prince would “not take him seriously because all the people who are dealing with Iran, either regionally or internationally, they know who holds the rein and it’s Khamenei.” Mr. Ahmadinejad’s disputed re-election in 2009 stirred national unrest and brutal crackdowns resulting in the killing of protesters and jailing of activists and journalists. Internationally he has generated outrage with provocative remarks about eliminating Israel and challenging the validity of the Holocaust. He also has asserted the debunked conspiracy theory that the United States staged the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In recent years his relationship with Iran’s leadership deteriorated, and Mr. Ahmadinejad tried to separate himself from many of the Islamic Republic’s policies. In an interview with The New York Times last year Mr. Ahmadinejad called for Iran to directly negotiate with President Trump because he was “a man of action,” and said he had written Mr. Trump three letters. He has recently been an outspoken critic of a proposed 25-year economic and military partnership between Iran and China and said Iranians would never accept such a deal. But the letter to the crown prince is perhaps Mr. Ahmadinejad’s boldest act of defiance. The letter, according to one of his advisers, also signals an opening to normalizing relations with the United States, despite Mr. Trump’s so-called maximum pressure policy against Iran. “Mr. Ahmadinejad believes in good strategic relations with everyone, including Saudi Arabia and the U.S.,” said the adviser, Abdul Reza Davari. “He believes Iran’s problems will not go away until the animosity with the U.S. is resolved and the road to Washington goes through Riyadh and we must pave the way.”']","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, known in the West for his Holocaust denial and disputed re-election in 2009, writes a warm letter to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, calling him a man of peace."
South Korea Confirms a Defector Swam Back to the North,2020-07-27,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The authorities in South Korea confirmed on Monday that a 24-year-old man who had defected from North Korea in 2017 had secretly returned to the North, crossing one of the world’s most heavily fortified borders during a pandemic and possibly bringing the coronavirus with him. On Sunday, North Korea claimed that a man had crossed into the country from the South, and that he was likely infected with the virus. South Korean officials went in search of any defectors who had gone missing, and by Monday they had zeroed in on the 24-year-old man, identified only by his family name, Kim. In 2017, he swam across the western inter-Korea border, which traces a path through a narrow sea strait, to defect to South Korea. On July 19, he swam back across the border into Kaesong, a city in the North, after crawling through a drain under barbed-wire fences, his family said. It was not immediately clear why the defector had returned to the North. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the man had been wanted by the South Korean police for questioning after a fellow North Korean defector accused him of raping her last month. North Korea said on Sunday that the man was “suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus,” \u200badding that he could be the country’s first virus case. The reverse defection prompted the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to order a total lockdown of Kaesong, a city of 300,000 people \u200bon the border with South Korea, and to declare a “maximum” national emergency. Until Sunday, North Korea had \u200brepeatedly \u200bsaid that it had no Covid-19 cases. The claim was questioned by outside experts given that the country shares a long land border with China, where the virus erupted late last year. The North also lacks equipment and medicine to fight an epidemic. But South Korean officials could not say whether the man might have \u200bcarried the coronavirus across the border. He had never been tested for the virus, Yoon Tae-ho, a senior official at the South’s national disease-control headquarters, said on Monday, and he was not known to have been in contact with a coronavirus patient. \u200bThe South Korean health authorities have tracked down two people who had frequent contact with the defector while he was in the South, and both tested negative, he said. South Korea’s military said on Monday that its investigators had found a bag belonging to the defector abandoned on Ganghwa Island, west of Seoul. They also found signs that he had crawled through a drain beneath the border’s barbed-wire fences. “We spotted the specific location from which he crossed over to the North on Ganghwa Island,” said Col. Kim Jun-rak, a spokesman for the South Korean military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a briefing on Monday. The defector’s current location is not known. South Korean officials said he was a native of Kaesong and was apparently familiar with the terrain around the western front line, where the Han River divides North and South Korea before emptying into the Yellow Sea. At some spots, the two sides are separated by over a mile of water. He apparently swam across the same general area where he had originally defected. \u200bAt least four other North Koreans have swum across the western river border to the South since 2012\u200b. The vast majority of the 33,000 North Koreans who have fled to the South since the early 1990s have gone through China. But some, like Mr. Kim, have crossed the inter-Korean border, which, in addition to being fortified by layers of tall, barbed-wire fences, is guarded by armed sentries and minefields.']",North Korea has accused him of bringing Covid-19 across the border. A South Korean news outlet says the 24-year-old man was wanted for questioning over a rape accusation.
"Fighting False News in Ukraine, Facebook Fact Checkers Tread a Blurry Line",2020-07-26,By Anton Troianovski,"['MOSCOW — To understand the complexity of policing online disinformation, consider the small Ukrainian fact-checking group StopFake. Earlier this year, Facebook hired StopFake to help curb the flow of Russian propaganda and other false news across its platform in Ukraine. StopFake, like all of Facebook’s outside fact checkers, signed a pledge to be nonpartisan and not to focus its checks “on any one side.” But in recent weeks, StopFake has been battling accusations of ties to the Ukrainian far right and of bias in its fact-checking. The episode has raised thorny questions for Facebook over whom it allows to separate truth from lies — and who is considered a neutral fact checker in a country at war. “They are empowering these organizations and these people to be making calls about what kind of information, what kind of opinions, what kind of communications are illegitimate or legitimate,” Matthew Schaaf, who leads the Ukraine office of the American human rights group Freedom House, said of Facebook and its fact checkers. “The question that needs to be asked is: Do these people deserve our trust?” A Ukrainian news outlet, Zaborona, published an article this month citing photographs of a prominent StopFake member meeting with nationalist figures, including a white-power rock musician whose lyrics deny the Holocaust. StopFake denied having any far-right ties or bias, calling the Zaborona article part of a campaign of slanderous “information attacks.” Zaborona’s editor, Katerina Sergatskova, said she fled Ukraine on Wednesday after receiving death threats. (StopFake has condemned the threats.) On Facebook, some of her critics had claimed, without evidence, that she was a Kremlin agent. The episode underlines the high stakes facing American social media companies as they try to respond to disinformation in the world’s geopolitical hot spots. After being criticized for failing to stop the spread of disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States, Facebook sought to avoid becoming an arbiter of truth by creating a third-party fact-checking program. The program now includes more than 50 organizations that check facts in more than 40 languages, including global news agencies such as Agence France-Presse and Reuters alongside smaller groups like StopFake. Yevhen Fedchenko, StopFake’s editor in chief, declined to comment for this article. He has told other media outlets that he plans to file a lawsuit to defend StopFake’s reputation, and he wrote in an email that “our legal team advised us against talking to media until the hearing in the court.” Facebook said in a written statement that all its fact checkers followed a “Code of Principles to promote fairness and nonpartisanship in fact-checking.” Baybars Örsek, the director of the group that administers that code of principles, said it was conducting an “interim assessment” of StopFake in light of the Zaborona report. He said his organization, the International Fact-Checking Network, which was set up by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., takes reports of far-right ties seriously. He acknowledged that nonpartisanship had long been a particularly difficult thing to ascertain during an armed conflict like Ukraine’s. “They are working in a country where they are still practically in war with Russia,” Mr. Örsek said of StopFake. “This is a question we also struggle with as fact checkers: How do you do nonpartisan fact-checking when you have tanks on the street?” Many European countries struggle with far-right groups, but critics say they are tolerated to an excessive degree in Ukraine because they share a common enemy with the country’s intellectual mainstream: Russia. The notion that Ukraine has a far-right problem, in turn, is amplified and distorted by Russian state propaganda, which often falsely refers to Ukraine’s pro-Western revolution in 2014 as a fascist coup. Deadly fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists continues to simmer in the country’s east. And propaganda has for years been a key tool for the Kremlin in its effort to keep Ukraine in Russia’s orbit. The debate over treatment of the far right came to a head after Zaborona published its article describing what it said was evidence of StopFake’s bias. The evidence included social media photographs showing Marko Suprun, who hosts StopFake’s English-language video program about Russian disinformation, meeting with two Ukrainian nationalist musicians at a gathering in 2017. The songs of one of the musicians, Arseniy Bilodub, include “Heroes of the White Race” and, referring to the Holocaust, “Six Million Words of Lies.” Anton Shekhovtsov, an external lecturer at the University of Vienna who studies far-right movements in Europe, said in an interview that he did not see StopFake itself as a far-right organization, “but I don’t think that they are nonpartisan.” StopFake countered that Zaborona was employing “the fallacy of guilt by association” in presenting the photographs as evidence of far-right connections on the part of Mr. Suprun. Mr. Suprun did not respond to requests for comment. “He has also been photographed alongside Rabbi Yakov Bleich, but this does not make him a member of his synagogue,” StopFake said in a lengthy response to the Zaborona article posted online. Mr. Suprun, the statement added, “is not involved in the joint fact-checking project StopFake has with Facebook.” Ms. Sergatskova, Zaborona’s editor, is originally from Russia and received Ukrainian citizenship in 2015. A prominent Ukrainian journalist on Facebook called her a “lefty F.S.B. mold” — referring to the Russian spy agency — and other commenters posted her Kyiv home address before she went into hiding. Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists urged the Ukrainian authorities to investigate the threats against Ms. Sergatskova. Ukrainian media organizations, including StopFake, signed an open letter condemning the threats. The Ukrainian police did not respond to a request for comment. Ms. Sergatskova said in a telephone interview after she went into hiding that her record as an independent journalist has been distorted by critics who saw her as playing into the Kremlin’s hands. “Truth is a lie, freedom is slavery — it’s an Orwell kind of story,” Ms. Sergatskova said. “By all appearances we really, really touched a nerve.” Ukrainian journalism students and faculty members launched StopFake in 2014 to counter Russian disinformation, drawing praise from Kyiv civil society and Western supporters of Ukraine. StopFake’s agreement this year to sign on as one of Facebook’s two fact-checking partners in Ukraine gave it newfound clout. Facebook says it reduces a post’s distribution in users’ news feeds if a third-party fact checker marks a post as false, but it does not take it down. Maksym Skubenko, who heads Facebook’s other Ukrainian fact-checking partner, VoxCheck, said users typically saw posts and articles marked as false within seconds of when his team enters a fact check into Facebook’s system. StopFake’s website shows that the organization has carried out some 200 fact checks of posts and articles for Facebook in Russian and Ukrainian since the group started working for the social network in April. Many of the fact checks are apolitical and related to the coronavirus pandemic. A smaller number address issues of Ukrainian national identity, generally when the item being fact-checked fits into a pro-Russian narrative. In one case, StopFake contested Facebook users’ claims that most Ukrainians celebrated the May 9 Soviet-era Victory Day holiday marking the defeat of Nazi Germany. In another, StopFake fact-checked an interview with a pro-Russian commentator that carried the headline “Ukraine Is Russian People.” When Facebook users try to share the article featuring the interview, they see a pop-up box titled “False Information in This Post.” If users then click “Post Anyway,” the article appears grayed-out on their profile with the words “False Information: Checked by independent fact checkers,” with a link to StopFake. The original article quotes the commentator as saying that there are “many Russian people” in Ukraine. StopFake’s fact check cites a poll in which 90 percent of Ukrainians describe their ethnicity as Ukrainian. The idea that Ukrainians are Russian is often repeated in Russian disinformation, said Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington who recently published a book on Russian disinformation. But it is “also a view that many Russians (and some Ukrainians themselves) subscribe to.” That leads to an unanswered question for Facebook. As Ms. Jankowicz put it: “Should opinions be fact-checked?” Mr. Skubenko, who heads Facebook’s other Ukrainian fact-checking partner, said he stayed away from issues of national identity. “In some cases, it’s impossible to check this in a fact-based way,” he said. “Then you have to write that it’s your personal opinion and not a fact check.” StopFake’s journalists, like many Ukrainians, “are trying to find this compromise between liberal values and patriotic values,” said Volodymyr Yermolenko, a philosopher who edits Ukraine World magazine. In so doing, he went on, StopFake seeks to break down a long history of Russian propaganda in Ukraine. “It’s a deconstruction of myths, on top of fact-checking,” he said. Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Davey Alba from New York.']",Facebook hired a Ukrainian group battling Russian disinformation to flag misleading posts. But critics say the fact checkers’ work veers into activism.
Migrants Adrift Off Malta Called for Help. Then They Waited. And Waited.,2020-07-27,By Gaia Pianigiani,"['The rubber dinghy packed tight with more that 95 people was bobbing helplessly in the Mediterranean on Sunday when the passengers issued a distress call, but help would not come anytime soon. In the end, it took more than 33 hours — and the pressure of activists and nongovernmental groups — before the Maltese authorities launched a rescue operation. All onboard were eventually brought to shore, but the incident, the latest of dozens like it in recent weeks, has raised questions about the risk to human life posed by policies intended to deter migrants from crossing the Mediterranean. The dinghy carrying the migrants, who were said to be from Eritrea, was one of dozens of vessels left adrift in the central Mediterranean in recent months, said Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. “The recurring delays that we are witnessing in rescuing people this year are unacceptable,” Mr. Di Giacomo said in a phone interview. “They put people’s lives at risk. These boats are unfit to sail; they can go down any time.” The migrants on the overcrowded dinghy Sunday contacted Alarm Phone, a watchdog group that often acts as first point of call for migrants adrift in the Mediterranean. The group says it alerted the authorities — but hours later, there was still no rescue in sight. “A merchant vessel is monitoring the situation but not providing assistance,” Alarm Phone wrote in a post on Twitter on Monday morning. “How long will the people be left suffering & at risk of drowning? How long can they survive?” Hours later, the International Organization for Migration echoed the concern. “Around 95 migrants are still floating in the Central Mediterranean at risk of drowning, after attempting to flee Libya,” it said. Not until Monday afternoon did the armed forces of Malta reportedly bring the group to shore. Activists have lamented the scarcity of independent rescue ships in the central Mediterranean, which has become a major crossing for migrants escaping war-torn Libya, and is one of the world’s most dangerous passages. Last week, Italy’s Coast Guard blocked the last ship operating for the migrant rescue organization SOS Mediterranée, citing administrative failures. In a statement, the organization said that the move was “aimed at impeding our lifesaving work,” and at discouraging other groups from doing the same. The Italian authorities also detained the vessel of another aid group, the Sea-Watch 3. These organizations have carried out the bulk of rescue operations in the Mediterranean in recent years since, particularly after Italy signed a memorandum of understanding with Libya in 2017 that effectively delegated most of the operations to the Libyan Coast Guard. In recent years, thousands of migrants have died while attempting the crossing. Two-hundred and seventy have drowned since January alone. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has made the situation still more complicated. Italy and Malta have both declared their ports not safe for migrants because of the public health threat. Malta, a tiny island nation, has been on the front line of the migration route for years. Its government has long been accused by migrant advocates of responding slowly — or not at all — to distress calls coming from their large search and rescue zone, and of allowing the Libyan Coast Guard to take back migrants who had already made it into their area of responsibility. Now, with the onset of the virus, Malta says it is too overwhelmed to do rescues. But it did secretly dispatch a fleet of private vessels in April to intercept migrants and return them by force to Libya, according to information provided by the captain of one of the boats, a senior commander in the Libyan Coast Guard, and a former Maltese official involved in the episode, who spoke to The New York Times earlier this year. That same month, 12 migrants died in a shipwreck that occurred after their rubber boat had been left adrift for days. The 51 survivors were returned to Tripoli. In Italy, processing procedures for migrants who arrive by boat have become lengthier because of the pandemic, and the government has been struggling to find places to quarantine migrants. Last week, Matteo Salvini, a far-right politician and former deputy prime minister, visited the island of Lampedusa, south of Sicily, where he drew on the mounting anger of the mayor. “This is not immigration, it’s chaos,” Mr. Salvini said in a video posted on his Facebook account. “It’s 800 people in a hot spot that can accommodate 90 people.” “They are on the roof, they are everywhere,” he said. Small wooden boats carrying migrants from Tunisia have landed on the shores of Lampedusa for years. But the number of migrant arrivals this year are far smaller than in the past. ']",A boat carrying 95 migrants on the Mediterranean floated adrift for more than 30 hours before the Maltese authorities finally brought them to shore under intense pressure.
"Poland Considers Leaving Treaty on Domestic Violence, Spurring Outcry",2020-07-27,By Marc Santora,"['The Polish government, emboldened by a narrow election victory this month and undeterred by criticism from European Union leaders, is considering withdrawing from a treaty aimed at curbing domestic violence and protecting women’s rights, with the country’s minister of justice filing paperwork on Monday to start the process. The move came just one week after European Union leaders, bowing to pressure from Poland and Hungary, relaxed demands that were supposed to tie funding in the bloc’s long-term budget to issues related to rule of law. In the days since, both Warsaw and Budapest have pressed ahead with agendas that critics say compromise judicial independence, media freedom and gay rights. Poland’s plan to pull out of the domestic abuse treaty is likely to face stiff resistance, however. The mere suggestion that the government wanted to withdraw prompted thousands of protesters to take to the streets over the weekend and led the Council of Europe, a human rights organization with 47 member countries, to express alarm at the prospect. The treaty, known as the Istanbul Convention, is intended to combat violence against women in Europe. Conceived more than a decade ago, the treaty has been caught up in a maelstrom of disinformation and populist rhetoric, cast as a threat to national sovereignty and twisted by conspiracy theories and smear campaigns. The convention has been targeted by far-right and nationalist leaders across East and Central Europe and has become a totem in the battle against what they portray as the too-liberal influences of Western culture. Although the treaty does not address issues of gay rights, opponents have claimed that the treaty promotes “L.G.B.T. ideology” and poses a threat to Christian morality. Ratification of the treaty has stalled in several European countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia and Slovakia. Russia, which is also a member of the Council of Europe, has not signed it. When a previous Polish government ratified the treaty in 2012, Zbigniew Ziobro, then a member of the opposition and now the Polish justice minister, called it “an invention, a feminist creation aimed at justifying gay ideology.” Although the government has insisted that no final decision has been made yet, Mr. Ziobro, a lawmaker from United Poland, the more conservative member of the governing coalition, organized a news conference on Monday to say that he had started the process of withdrawal. Mr. Ziobro also said he believed that Poland had “a higher level of protection of women than in the convention,” and he added that the treaty had “a second part, which concerns ideology and harms the interests of women and of family.” Mr. Ziobro’s increasing attacks on the treaty came just one week after the leaders of the 27 member nations of the European Union agreed to take on hundreds of billions of euros in common debt. To convince Poland and Hungary to back the deal, European leaders watered down language making funding conditional on the rule-of-law benchmarks. Returning from Brussels, where the budget negotiations had taken place, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland said his country had notched a success. “We are coming back as the great winner,” he said. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary struck a similarly triumphant note. His government has been solidifying control over the country’s news media in ways critics say undermine press freedom. Hungary signed onto the Istanbul Convention in 2014 but has never ratified the treaty. The most recent attempt to get legislative approval came at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in May and failed. David Vig, director of Amnesty International in Hungary, said then that the decision was “extremely dangerous coming at a time when reported domestic violence incidents in Hungary have doubled since the start of the COVID-19 lockdown.” The attack on the treaty in Poland has been folded into a broader culture war — a fight over values that led to the one of the closest presidential contests since the first partially free election was held in the former communist country in 1989. Strong rhetoric against gays and lesbians was at the heart of President Andrzej Duda’s campaign for re-election. He said “L.G.B.T. ideology” was more dangerous than communist doctrine. Mr. Duda narrowly won, in large part thanks to support from influential members of the Catholic clergy. But rather than trying to heal the rifts of the bitter campaign, the government has pressed ahead in its efforts to protect what it defines as “traditional values.” On Friday, thousands of women, some dressed as characters from “The Handmaid’s Tale,”  demonstrated outside the headquarters of a conservative Catholic group, Ordo Iuris, in Warsaw. Protesters held up the obituaries of Polish women killed by their partners and husbands. “This government has been laughing in the faces of victims of gender violence for years,” said Marta Lempart, one of the leaders of the Polish Women’s Strike, which previously organized nationwide protests of the government’s attempts to tighten what are already some of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws. Marija Pejcinovic Buric, secretary general of the Council of Europe, said in a statement on Sunday that Poland’s withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention “would be highly regrettable and a major step backwards in the protection of women against violence in Europe.” While it does not carry legal force in any country, the treaty’s signatories are expected to introduce laws which criminalize psychological and physical violence against women, including sexual violence, rape, stalking, forced marriage and forced abortion. The states that ratify the document also commit to prevent and prosecute crimes against women; introduce educational campaigns about the topic; and adhere to a monitoring procedure, assessing the implementation of the convention. In Slovakia, which has signed but not ratified, the treaty has been targeted by a wide range of groups on the right, including the neo-fascist Kotlebists — People’s Party Our Slovakia. During the prelude to national elections this year, hundreds of people gathered in the capital, Bratislava, for a “prayer” against the “evil from Istanbul.” In Bulgaria, the treaty has faced fierce backlash from across the political spectrum, with critics claiming that it would force the country to legalize same-sex marriages and what they refer to as the “third gender.” The Bulgarian Constitutional Court found in 2018 that the convention defined the term “gender” in a manner incompatible with Bulgarian law. The judges argued that by defining gender as a social construct, the treaty blurred the lines between the sexes. “If society loses its ability to distinguish between a woman and a man, combating violence against women would remain a formal yet futile commitment,” the court found. Advocates have condemned the political efforts to sabotage the treaty. “Simply put, the Istanbul Convention aims to prevent and combat violence against women,” said Radoslav Stoyanov, an expert with the legal program of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization based in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. “However,” he added, “the public debate somehow missed the core aims of the treaty.” In Poland, withdrawal from the treaty would probably have little practical impact because the government has not used it to advance much legislation that protects women. Last year, lawmakers proposed defining domestic violence as having taken place only when spouses had been beaten more than once, though that plan was abandoned after a fierce backlash. Domestic violence in Poland is widespread and underreported, according to the Warsaw-based Women’s Rights Center, an organization that works to prevent attacks against women. The center estimates that about 800,000 women in Poland are victims every year, with the 400 to 500 deaths reported each year from beatings, murder and suicide tied to domestic violence most likely understating the problem. Natalia Broniarczyk, an activist with the group Abortion Without Borders, said, “Politicians from the ruling party know that violence against women is an everyday reality in Poland,” adding, “What is the most cruel is the timing — they are coming back to the issue during a pandemic, when the situation of victims of violence has gotten much worse, as they were locked in with their abusers.” Reporting was contributed by Monika Pronczuk from Brussels; Anatol Magdziarz from Warsaw; Kit Gillet from Bucharest, Romania; Boryana Dzhambazova from Sofia, Bulgaria; and Miroslava German Sirotnikova from Bratislava, Slovakia.']","The European treaty was intended to protect women from abuse, but it has become a target for populist and nationalist leaders who claim it poses a threat to “traditional families.”"
North Korea Declares Emergency After Suspected Covid-19 Case,2020-07-25,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Sunday that it had locked down a city near its border with South Korea and declared a “maximum” national emergency after finding what its leader, Kim Jong-un, said could be the country’s first case of Covid-19 there. It issued the high alert after a North Korean who had defected to South Korea three years ago but secretly crossed back into the North’s Kaesong City last Sunday was “suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said on Sunday. After running several tests, the health authorities put the person and contacts under quarantine, as well as those who have been in Kaesong City in the last five days, the North Korean news agency said. While reporting the incident, the agency stopped short of calling it the country’s first case of the coronavirus, saying the test result was “uncertain.” But it was serious enough that Mr. Kim called an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Political Bureau on Saturday, where he admitted that his country may have its first outbreak of Covid-19. “There happened a critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying, while declaring “a state of emergency” around Kaesong City and ordering his country to shift to “the maximum emergency system and issue a top-class alert.” Mr. Kim “took the pre-emptive measure of \u200b\u200btotally blocking Kaesong City and isolating each district and region from the other” on Friday shortly after he received a report on the situation, the North Korean news agency said. Until now North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated countries, has repeatedly said that it has no case of Covid-19, although outside experts questioned the claim. A Covid-19 outbreak could seriously test North Korea’s underequipped public health system and its economy, already struggling under international sanctions. International relief agencies have been providing test kits and other assistance to help the country fight any potential spread of Covid-19. North Korea has taken some of the most drastic actions of any country against the virus, and did so sooner than most other nations. It sealed its borders in late January, shutting off business with neighboring China, which accounts for nine-tenths of its external trade. It clamped down on the smugglers who keep its thriving unofficial markets functioning. It quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. \u200bThe government’s ability to control the movement of people\u200b also bolsters its disease-control efforts. But decades of isolation and international sanctions have raised concerns that \u200bit lacks the medical supplies to fight an outbreak, which many fear has already occurred. \u200bNorth Korea’s senior disease-control officials attended the Political Bureau meeting Mr. Kim called on Saturday, while other senior government and party officials from across the country watched it through video conferencing, state media reported. Mr. Kim ordered them to fight the spread of the virus “\u200bwith a sense of boundless responsibility, loyalty and devotion.” \u200bNorth Korea did not reveal the identity of the North Korean runaway who it said returned home with the possible virus infection from South Korea. The South Korean government did not immediately react to the North Korean claim. The North said it was investigating a military unit for failing to catch the runaway when the person first slipped through the inter-Korean border to defect to the South three years ago, and said it planned to “administer a severe punishment and take necessary measures.” The defector returned home last Sunday after illegally crossing back, it said. More than 30,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea since the early 1990s. But some have failed to adapt to life in the capitalist South Korea and fled back to the North. Still, defections across the inter-Korean border, one of the world’s most heavily armed, are rare.']",The country locked down a city near its border with South Korea.

Kyrgyzstan Rights Activist Azimzhan Askarov Dies at 69,2020-07-27,By The Associated Press,"['MOSCOW (AP) — Azimzhan Askarov, a human rights advocate in Kyrgyzstan who was serving a life term on charges of involvement in ethnic violence that were widely criticized as trumped-up, has died in a prison clinic. He was 69. The U.N. Human Rights Committee and leading international human rights organizations had repeatedly urged the Central Asian nation’s authorities to release Mr. Askarov, noting his deteriorating health. Kyrgyzstan’s state penitentiary service said Mr. Askarov died Saturday in a prison clinic, a day after he was hospitalized with pneumonia. It noted in a statement that Mr. Askarov was also suffering from a heart condition and other chronic illnesses. His lawyer, Valeryan Vakhitov, said Mr. Askarov had a bad cough and experienced breathing difficulty when they last met recently, the Interfax news agency reported. Mr. Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek rights activist, has been sentenced to life in prison for his alleged role in the deadly ethnic violence in southern Kyrgyzstan in 2010. Several days of clashes between ethnic Kyrgyz and minority Uzbeks in the southern cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad killed 470 people, nearly three-quarters of whom were ethnic Uzbeks. Thousands of houses were destroyed and some 400,000 fled their homes. International rights groups criticized Kyrgyz authorities for mostly targeting the Uzbek minority while investigating the ethnic violence and failing to ensure justice for its victims. Before his detention, Mr. Askarov had led a human rights organization in southern Kyrgyzstan focused on prison conditions and police treatment of detainees. He documented violence and looting during the June 2010 violence. In September 2010, Mr. Askarov was found guilty of participating in riots, inciting ethnic hatred and abetting the slaying of a police officer killed during the unrest. Human Rights Watch and other rights groups said Mr. Askarov’s detention and trial were marred by serious human rights violations, including credible allegations of torture. In 2016, the U.N. Human Rights Committee found that Mr. Askarov was arbitrarily detained, held in inhumane conditions, tortured and mistreated. It urged Kyrgyzstan to immediately release Mr. Askarov and quash his conviction. Mr. Askarov’s lawyers repeatedly appealed, but Kyrgyz courts upheld his conviction.']","The human rights advocate, who was serving a life sentence on charges related to 2010 ethnic violence widely criticized as trumped-up, died in a prison clinic."
"As the World Gets Tougher on China, Japan Tries to Thread a Needle",2020-07-25,By Motoko Rich and Makiko Inoue,"['TOKYO — Earlier this year, as it became clear that the coronavirus pandemic was not going to pass quickly, the Japanese government delayed plans for what would be the first state visit by a Chinese leader to Tokyo since 2008. Now, with Chinese military aggression rising in the region and Beijing cracking down on Hong Kong, Japan is considering canceling Xi Jinping’s visit altogether — but very gingerly. “We are not in the phase of arranging a concrete schedule now” was how Toshimitsu Motegi, the foreign minister, put it this month. While its top allies have taken a harder line on China — especially the United States, which dramatically escalated tensions this past week by closing the Chinese Consulate in Houston — Japan has pursued a delicate balancing act, mindful of the economic might of its largest trading partner and its own limited military options. So as Chinese ships have engaged in the longest series of incursions in or near Japanese waters in several years, Japan has offered a restrained response, vowing to be firm but “calm.” It did not join several Western nations in an initial statement criticizing the draconian security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong. It has abandoned plans to purchase an American missile defense system, which in part had been considered a shield against China. And the government has continued to tiptoe around the issue of the state visit by Mr. Xi, even as polls show that most Japanese believe it should be scrapped. “Certainly Japan is in a dilemma,” said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “We understand the fact that Japan is basically competing with China while cooperating with it. We are playing those two games at the same time.” For other world powers, this kind of middle ground on China, in the face of its growing authoritarianism and heightened bellicosity, has become less and less tenable. The United States has approved sanctions against Chinese companies and officials and pushed back on China’s broad territorial claims in the region’s seas. Australia led the call for a global inquiry into the origins of the pandemic, which began in China, and announced an investment of nearly $1 billion in cyberweapons and defenses to counter Beijing. Britain and Canada, along with Australia, have suspended extradition agreements with Hong Kong because of the national security law. China has responded by curbing Australian imports and threatening an array of retaliatory actions against any countries that move to punish it. On Friday, China responded to the closure of its Houston consulate by ordering the United States to shut its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu. To some extent, Japan’s mild-mannered response to China echoes its broader approach to foreign policy, in which it tends to avoid direct conflict or public rebukes of other nations. It has also sometimes sought a mediating role, as when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met last December with Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, to try to ease tensions in the Middle East. Not so long ago, China and Japan — the world’s second- and third-largest economies — were engaged in a diplomatic thaw as a hedge against an unpredictable Trump administration. In 2018, Mr. Abe became the first Japanese leader to visit China in seven years, and the two leaders pledged deeper economic and political cooperation. The invitation to Mr. Xi to visit Japan followed soon afterward. Now, given China’s muscle-flexing as the world is preoccupied with the pandemic, some have expressed disappointment that Japan has not rebuffed its neighbor more vigorously, such as by definitively canceling Mr. Xi’s visit. In recent weeks, China has engaged in deadly clashes on its border with India in the Himalayas, and it has sent ships for 100 straight days — the longest period in years of such incursions — to patrol waters around the Senkakus, islands administered by Japan but contested by China. Japan “should just say ‘we cannot have him if China continues with this sort of behavior,’” said Jeffrey Hornung, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, referring to Mr. Xi. But Mr. Hornung acknowledged that Tokyo would not want to draw China’s full ire, either. “If you look at what China is doing with India or Hong Kong, Japan doesn’t want to be at the tip of China’s spear right now,” Mr. Hornung said. “They know what they could do around the Senkakus in terms of swarming it with ships.” On Hong Kong, Japan did not join the United States, Australia, Canada and Britain in an initial statement criticizing the national security law. It subsequently led an effort to draft a statement by the foreign ministers of the Group of 7 countries expressing “grave concern” about the law, and Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party passed a resolution this month saying it could not “just remain on the sidelines seeing the situation” in Hong Kong. In response to the Chinese incursions in the East China Sea, Japan has mobilized Self-Defense Forces fighter jets to patrol the area. It continues, though, to use mild language in its protests to the Chinese government. Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Mr. Abe, told reporters that the Japanese government had “strongly requested” that Chinese ships “stop approaching Japanese fishing boats and quickly leave Japanese territory.” He added, “We would like to continue responding firmly in a calm manner.” Parts of the Japanese government have highlighted China’s growing hostility. Earlier this month, the defense ministry warned that China was trying to “alter the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea,” and it ranked China as a more serious long-term threat than North Korea. Yet Japan’s recent decision to abandon its plan to buy an American missile defense system, known as Aegis Ashore, led some to wonder if it would now be more exposed to potential attacks from both North Korea and China. The decision may have looked to some like a genuflection to Beijing. But soon afterward, the defense committee of the governing party discussed whether Japan could acquire weapons that would enable it to strike a missile launch site, if it detected signs of an imminent attack by a neighbor. Those discussions are in the early stages, and they would require extensive examination by constitutional experts to determine if such a capability would violate the pacifist clause in Japan’s Constitution. “While the cancellation of Aegis Ashore might put Japan in a more vulnerable position, if Japan uses this opportunity to pivot to acquisition of other capabilities, then the result could be even more worrying for China,” said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor in the department of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. One area where Japan has taken steps against China is the economy. Earlier this year, it passed a law restricting foreign investment in industries that the government designates as important to national security, a move that many viewed as targeting China. It has also offered financial incentives to companies — especially those in crucial sectors — to move operations out of China and into Japan or Southeast Asia. “The Chinese economy is recovering while other countries are still deteriorating,” said Takahide Kiuchi, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, a think tank. “Now China is in a good position to purchase companies in other countries, so the government is cautious about critical industries related to the military and national security.” Still, Japan does not want to push too hard. In addition to being Japan’s largest trading partner, China sent more tourists to Japan than any other nation before the pandemic shut borders. Last year, close to 115,000 Chinese students were studying at Japanese universities. The government, which has imposed entry bans on nearly 150 countries during the pandemic, is now discussing admitting travelers from several Asian countries, including China. “A couple of years ago, it seemed like there was space for Japan to be seen as a mediator because relations between the U.S. and China had become so bad,” Ms. Govella said. But with China’s increasing aggression, it “really is an actor that has different values and dubious intentions in the region,” she said. As China pursues this more belligerent policy, Japanese analysts say they hope that Beijing might learn from Japan’s own history and not try to expand its power too far, particularly by repressive means. China’s efforts to dominate the South China Sea, for example, are “one step toward kicking out the Western elements from their sphere of influence, which they have been dreaming of for the past century and a half,” said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat who is now teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. “Their nationalistic ambition will not end,” he said. “I am very concerned, and nobody can stop it, as they couldn’t stop us in Manchuria in the 1930s,” Mr. Miyake said, referring to Japan’s invasion of that region of eastern China. “At that time, the more pressure we had, the more adamant and arrogant and self-assertive we became, because we were too nationalistic and too undemocratic, and that was our destiny,” Mr. Miyake said. “China is following the same path.”']","Tokyo has not confronted Beijing as the United States and other allies have, mindful of its neighbor’s economic might and its own limited military options."
Boris Johnson’s New Tactic Against the Virus: Urge Britons to Lose Weight,2020-07-27,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — Britain will crack down on junk food advertising and introduce calorie counts on menus in an effort to tackle obesity and ease the pressure on the country’s National Health Service amid the coronavirus pandemic, the government said on Monday. For the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the intersection of obesity and the coronavirus is personal. Mr. Johnson was, by his own admission, “way overweight” when he was admitted to the hospital after becoming ill with Covid-19 this year, and his health deteriorated to such an extent that at one point he needed intensive care. Studies have linked obesity to a greater risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19, and Mr. Johnson, writing in the British newspaper The Daily Express, described his time in hospital as a “wake-up call.” “We all put things off — I know I have,” Mr. Johnson wrote. “I’ve wanted to lose weight for ages, and like many people I struggle with my weight.” “I go up and down, but during the whole coronavirus epidemic and when I got it, too, I realized how important it is not to be overweight,” he added. As part of the government’s new obesity strategy, advertisements for any food high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned on television and online until 9 p.m. to avoid hours when children are most likely to see them. There will also be a consultation on whether Britain should entirely ban online ads for junk food. All large restaurants and cafes will be required to add a calorie count to their menus, and the government will look into adding calorie labels to alcoholic drinks. Promotional offers like “buy one, get one free” on fatty or sugary foods will also be prohibited. Obesity in Britain has long been cited as a growing problem and as a drain on the N.H.S., and the country is usually near the top of lists ranking Europe’s fattest countries. Government statistics show almost two-thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese. The World Health Organization estimates that about 39 percent of adults worldwide are overweight and that around 13 percent are obese. More than 45,000 people in Britain have died from the coronavirus. Nearly 8 percent of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units have been morbidly obese, the British government said, even though morbidly obese people account for only 2.9 percent of the general population. Mr. Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter on Monday that he had lost more than 14 pounds since his time in the hospital. The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, reported that the prime minister weighed 245 pounds when he was hospitalized in April. Even with his recent slimming, Mr. Johnson, who is about 5 feet 10 inches tall, would still rank as obese, according to an N.H.S. calculator, though the prime minister said he had only just started concentrating on building his fitness and losing weight. The wide-ranging measures announced on Monday are a change in tack for Mr. Johnson, who last year described a levy on sugary drinks as “sin stealth taxes” and warned of the “continuing creep of the nanny state.” Professor Parveen Kumar, a spokeswoman for the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said in a statement on Monday that the strategy “could go a long way in kick-starting a health revolution for the nation.” But the measures did not receive such a warm welcome from the food and retail industry. Tim Rycroft, the chief operating officer at the Food and Drink Federation, a group representing manufacturers in the sector, called the plans a “punishing blow” for companies that had been “heralded by government for feeding the nation during the Covid crisis.” The federation said that, while it supported the government’s push for Britain to become healthier, the proposed policies had been shown to be ineffective and would serve only to raise prices.']","The prime minister, who cited his own problems with obesity, said his hospitalization with Covid-19 had prompted his push to tighten regulations on junk food."
Volunteer Confesses to Starting Fire at Nantes Cathedral,2020-07-26,By Théophile Larcher,"['PARIS — A Rwandan refugee who volunteered at the 15th-century cathedral in Nantes, France, has confessed to setting a fire that severely damaged the interior of the church this month, his lawyer said on Sunday. The Rwandan man, who is 39 and whose name was not made public, was arrested on Sunday after the police said they had acquired unspecified new forensic evidence. He had been questioned and released earlier in the investigation. “My client is relieved to have told the truth,” the man’s lawyer, Quentin Chabert, said during a news conference on Sunday. He added that his client “regretted his act” but did not give any motive. The fire broke out at the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in the early hours of July 18, and the French authorities quickly opened an arson investigation, saying that three starting points for the blaze had been found inside the building and that there were no signs of a break-in. The volunteer was responsible for locking up the church at night. Pierre Sennès, the prosecutor in Nantes, said on Sunday that the volunteer had been charged with arson and that he faced up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, about $175,000. “We have determined that the man was in the area of the cathedral the morning the fire broke,” Mr. Sennès said, according to the newspaper Ouest-France. “We noticed, in two or three locations where the fire started, troubling elements that could corroborate a criminal act,” he added, noting that an “inflammable product” had been found in the building. The fire at the Nantes cathedral came just over a year after a blaze engulfed Notre-Dame in Paris, bringing the Paris landmark to the verge of collapse and raising questions about the security risks for historic churches across the country. Firefighters were able to bring the flames in Nantes under control within hours, but the fire destroyed a 17th-century organ. Also lost were stained-glass windows that contained remnants of 16th-century glass, and an 1835 painting by Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin depicting the first bishop of Nantes. The Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in Nantes was built over four centuries and completed in 1891. It was previously damaged by fire in 1972, when much of its wooden framework was destroyed. It was reinforced with concrete as the structure was rebuilt over the next 13 years. The French government has said it will ensure the restoration of the cathedral. Experts say the work will take at least three years.']","French prosecutors have charged the man, a Rwandan refugee, with arson. He had been questioned and released earlier in the investigation."
These Monkeys Were Once Revered. Now They Are Taking Over.,2020-07-25,By Hannah Beech,"['LOPBURI, Thailand — The customers waiting outside a bank in Lopburi, Thailand, left their jewelry at home and kept other treasures out of sight. But danger lurked anyway. In broad daylight, they watched a thief steal an iced tea and a vandal brazenly attack a motorcycle seat. One woman quit her place in the line, when a stalker crept up and threatened to bite her. With a sigh, a police officer brandished a slingshot, and the monkeys scattered. Less than a minute later, they were back. Lopburi, a onetime capital of a Siamese kingdom and a repository of ancient architecture, is a city under siege. Crab-eating macaques, a Southeast Asian species with piercing eyes and curious natures, have spilled out of the temples where they were once revered and taken over the heart of the old town. Their growing population, at least 8,400 in the area with most concentrated in a few city blocks, has decimated parts of the local economy. With territorial troupes of macaques roaming the neighborhood, dozens of businesses — including a music school, gold shop, barber, cellphone store and movie theater — have been forced to close in recent years. The coronavirus pandemic has added to the chaos. The frolicking monkeys drew droves of tourists as well as Buddhist faithful, who believe feeding the animals is a meritorious deed. Their favorite offerings included coconut yogurt, strawberry soda and brightly colored snack packs. Now the macaques don’t understand where that source of sustenance has gone. And they are hungry. Over the years, the monkeys moved into abandoned buildings, trashing display cases and rattling the bars installed to keep them out. Unless security guards are vigilant, they rip antennas and windshield wipers off parked cars. Dangling earrings, sunglasses and plastic bags that look like they may have food in them are irresistible to the monkeys. And in the areas of the city most densely packed with the animals, many residents live in fear of the next sneak attack. But in a Buddhist-majority culture in which culling monkeys would disturb spiritual sensibilities, local officials and residents have few options to fend off the gangs of macaques. Besides, in the past, the monkeys drew tourists to Lopburi. Without them, the economy might suffer even more. At a hardware store across the street from the ruins of a 13th-century Hindu temple, oversized stuffed animals in the shape of crocodiles and tigers peer out at the street where the monkey traffic outpaces that of pedestrians. The plush toys were meant to scare away the monkeys and it worked for a couple months. But the macaques soon figured out that they weren’t real, said Yupa Srisanguan, the shop owner. “It has never been this bad,” Ms. Yupa said, as a young male macaque wandered into her store, intent on chewing the loops of rubber hose hanging from the ceiling. “We’re not against the monkeys, but it’s difficult when people are afraid of being bitten when they come to our store.” When she was a little girl, Ms. Yupa, 70, said, the monkeys were fewer, bigger and healthier, their fur shiny and thick. They kept to the temples, as well as the ruins of the ancient Khmer civilization that once held sway over this part of central Thailand. But with an influx of monkey-enchanted visitors, some foreign, came an easy and often unhealthy font of food. Along with bananas and citrus, the macaques feasted on junk. Their fur thinned. Some went bald. Without having to worry about their next meal, the monkeys, which can give birth twice a year, had more time for other pursuits. The population exploded. Compared with the monkeys of the forest, their urban counterparts have less muscle and are more susceptible to hypertension and blood disease, said Narongporn Doodduem, the director of a regional office of the Wildlife Conservation Department. “The monkeys are never hungry,” he said, “just like children who eat too much KFC.” As traffic recently piled up at a light in old town Lopburi, Nirad Pholngeun, a police officer, kept his slingshot at the ready. He has been stationed at this street corner for five years and has watched the growing monkey population with alarm. A truck, presumably from out of town, idled at the light, its flatbed filled with crates of fruit for the market. A monkey spotted the produce, wove through the traffic, leapt onto the truck and held aloft a juicy dragon fruit. The one expeditionary macaque drew dozens more. By the time the light turned green, the crates were cleared and the gorging began. Throughout the mayhem, Mr. Nirad raised his slingshot but there was little a police officer could do against so many macaques. His battle tactic was a charade anyway. The slingshot held no projectiles. “It’s hopeless,” he said. “Within a blink of an eye there are more monkeys. So many babies.” Local wildlife officials have begun sterilizing the monkeys en masse to control their numbers. More than 300 animals underwent surgery last month, and 200 more will be sterilized in August. Capturing the monkeys for the operations is a major undertaking, said Mr. Narongporn, the wildlife official. On the first day of the June campaign, the monkey catchers wore camouflage-printed uniforms and lured the animals into cages with food. But by the second day, the monkeys knew to avoid them. The monkey catchers had to switch to wearing shorts and floral shirts, pretending they were holidaymakers. “The monkeys are smart,” Mr. Narongporn said. “They remember.” With the coronavirus dissuading many tourists and Buddhist pilgrims from visiting Lopburi, local residents have taken to feeding the monkeys themselves. “We can’t let them starve,” said Itiphat Tansitikulphati, the owner of the Muang Thong Hotel. Every day, an old female monkey calls on his hotel, waiting politely for her meal to be served. Banana cake is her favorite, but plain fruit will do, too. “A long time ago, a lot of Lopburi was forest so we are taking the land from the monkeys,” Mr. Itiphat said. A third generation hotelier, he has relinquished the top floor to the monkeys, who have wrecked it with the zeal of drunken partygoers, ripping up wooden planks and shredding corrugated metal. An electric fence protects the ground floor of the hotel. But even before the coronavirus hit, visitors, many of whom were traveling businesspeople, were scared off by the marauding monkeys, Mr. Itiphat said. His hotel barely survives. “The balance between humans and monkeys is off,” he said. “It hurts business.” Nearby, Patiphan Tantiwong runs a general store on the main street of Lopburi. He has given in to the macaques. A plump male sat on bags of dog food, sipping a yogurt drink. A clutch of youngsters swarmed a counter waiting for handouts of cookies. There were monkeys among the piles of batteries and monkeys among the light bulbs. The babies squeaked and played a form of macaque peekaboo. “The monkeys were here before us,” Mr. Patiphan said, as a juvenile tugged on the hem of his trousers demanding a treat. “We have to adapt to them, not the other way around.” Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.']","The monkeys of Lopburi, Thailand, were once a draw for tourists and pilgrims who would feed them.

An American Mustache That Irritated South Koreans Is No More,2020-07-27,By Tiffany May,"['The mustache, a thick salt-and-pepper number neatly shaped into a chevron, had survived questions, protests and even Photoshopped ridicule. But it has met its match: the long, sticky days of a Korean pandemic summer. At least that was the account given by the American ambassador to South Korea, Harry B. Harris Jr., as he walked into a Seoul barbershop. He sat down for a clean shave of a bit of facial hair he had held fast to for two years, even as it threatened to escalate diplomatic tensions. Some in South Korea had viewed the mustache worn by Mr. Harris, a Japanese-American, as a distasteful reminder of those worn by the colonial Japanese governors who ruled Korea from 1910 to 1945, a period that holds traumatic memories on the peninsula. Mr. Harris long maintained that he meant no disrespect with his mustache, which he said he had grown for his retirement as a Navy admiral. This weekend, though, he said that the facial hair had become intolerable under the masks he had been wearing in the muggy heat. “For some people, they can wear a mask and have a mustache or a beard. But for me, it’s just uncomfortable in this heat, and I have to wear a mask,” Mr. Harris said in a video posted on Saturday by the U.S. Embassy. The video, which showed him bumping elbows with a barber in a traditional wood-paneled shop before settling in for his shave, was produced in the style of a cheerful game show, punctuated by dramatic sound effects and captions in bubble font. Draped in pink towels, Mr. Harris rolled his eyes to comic effect when the barber dipped his black leather seat backward and brought a pale green razor to his face. “Glad I did this. For me, it was either keep the ‘stache or lose the mask,” Mr. Harris wrote in a tweet on Saturday. Mr. Harris, who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American Navy officer, became ambassador to South Korea in 2018. One of the first questions he was asked upon landing in the country was about his mustache, with some South Koreans wondering if it was a calculated insult. In 2019, demonstrators protesting the cost of hosting U.S. troops in South Korea held placards with Photoshopped cat whiskers on his face. In an interview with The Korea Times in December, Mr. Harris said that the mustache reflected his new life as a diplomat after a four-decade career in the Navy that required him to be clean-shaven at most times. He said his ethnicity had no bearing on his work in the embassy, adding: “I’m American ambassador to Korea, not the Japanese-American ambassador to Korea.” Asked at the time whether he would shave in order to improve his relationship with South Koreans, he said he would keep the facial hair. “You would have to convince me that somehow the mustache is viewed in a way that hurts our relationship,” he said.']","Blaming the summer’s heat, the U.S. ambassador lopped off a bit of facial hair that had reminded some of brutal colonial Japan."
Mothers’ Power in U.S. Protests Echoes a Global Tradition,2020-07-25,By Amanda Taub,"['Wearing matching shades of white or yellow, the women of the “Wall of Moms” in Portland, Ore., have become instant icons of the city’s protests, though the mothers nightly gatherings only began last Saturday and the city’s protests have been going on for more than a month. They join a long line of mothers’ protests against state violence and what they view as authoritarianism around the world, including in South Africa, Sri Lanka, Argentina and Armenia, which have shown that mothers can be particularly effective advocates for a cause — but also that there is a catch. History suggests that mothers’ power is most potent when they are able to wield their own respectability, and the protections it brings, as a political cudgel. But that is easiest for women who are already privileged: married, affluent, and members of the dominant racial or ethnic group. Mothers who are less privileged often struggle to claim that power, even though they are often the ones who most urgently need it. Teressa Raiford, a Black mother who is the executive director of Don’t Shoot Portland, a local group that works to end police violence, helped to organize and direct the Wall of Moms’ early actions, but noted that the positive response to the mostly white mothers has been proof of the very racism they are protesting. Mothers had been participating in the protests for five weeks, but “nobody recognized them until they literally put on white so they could be highlighted as white,” she said. “What it does show us is that Black lives don’t matter here, white moms do,” she said. “And those moms know that, too. That’s why they’re standing in solidarity with us.” Bev Barnum — who posted the original Facebook message asking moms to come and protest, and serves as the group’s informal leader and organizer — said she had asked women to color-coordinate their outfits in order to stand out in the crowd, but otherwise told them to dress “like they were going to Target.” “I wanted us to look like moms,” Ms. Barnum said in an interview. “Because who wants to shoot a mom? No one.” Ms. Barnum said she identified as Mexican-American, not white, but other members say the group is mostly white. Mothers’ protests are often powerful precisely because the gender roles that ordinarily silence and sideline women, allowing them to be seen as nonthreatening, turn into armor for political activism, experts say. During Armenia’s 2018 “velvet revolution,” a largely nonviolent uprising that eventually toppled the country’s leader, Serzh Sargsyan, mothers took to the streets pushing their children in strollers, indelibly tying their maternal identities to their political demands. In Armenia, “mothers are symbolic to the nation and, to some extent, have immunity in protests,” Ulrike Ziemer, a sociologist at the University of Winchester in Britain, wrote in a 2019 book chapter about the uprising. “If police would have touched mothers with their children in prams during the protests, that would have brought shame on them individually, but also on the state apparatus they represent.” In the Armenian protests, mothers from all walks of life were able to claim those protections, Dr. Ziemer said in an interview. But in societies that are divided along racial or ethnic lines, mothers from marginalized groups cannot access that full political power so easily. In South Africa, the Black Sash, a group of white women who opposed the apartheid regime, were able to use their gender and race as a shield for their political activity that others could not. “The Government has let Black Sash survive while closing down other anti-apartheid groups in part because white South African society has perched its women on pedestals,” The Times reported in 1988. “The police find it awkward to pack the paddy wagons with well-bred troublemakers who look like their mothers or sisters.” The government had no such compunction about locking up Black women. Albertina Sisulu, a pioneering Black anti-apartheid activist who was also a married mother of five, was arrested and held in solitary confinement multiple times. Countless other Black women suffered even worse fates. In Sri Lanka, women from the Tamil minority group have been protesting for years to demand information about sons and daughters who were kidnapped by state forces during the country’s civil war and never heard from again. Their activism has drawn international attention and some limited engagement from the country’s government. But when the women’s demands went beyond their own individual grief and engaged with politics more broadly, national politicians and civil society groups dismissed them as pawns of male activists, said Dharsha Jegatheeswaran, co-director of the Adayaalam Centre for Policy Research, a Sri Lanka-based think tank. As members of a marginalized minority group, she said, motherhood could take them only so far. In the United States, there is a long tradition of Black women claiming their identities as mothers when protesting against police shootings, lynchings, and mass incarceration. But, like the Tamil activists in Sri Lanka, they have tended to be viewed through the narrow lens of their own grief and fear for their children. White women have typically been taken far more seriously by white audiences as representing mothers generally — another case of bias on display. Ann Gregory, a lawyer and mother of two who joined the wall of moms in Portland on Sunday, said they had hoped to serve as a buffer between other demonstrators and law enforcement. “We realize that we’re a bunch of white women, and we do have privilege,” she said. “We were hoping to use that to protect the protesters.” Instead, the women got a crash course in the grievances that had set off the protests in the first place. Ms. Barnum, new to such activism, said she was surprised when other demonstrators warned her group that they could be in danger. “The news said that if you give the police officer a reason to fear for their life, a reasonable fear, they could hurt you,” she said. “But if you didn’t give them a reason then they wouldn’t hurt you.” The moms, she reasoned, would be peaceful and give the officers no cause for alarm, so had no reason to worry. That may seem an unusual belief for someone attending a protest against police violence, but it illustrates the privilege taken for granted by many people who have not had run-ins with law enforcement. So on her first night at the protests, when federal officers fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades at the group of moms, “I couldn’t believe what was happening,” she said. “We weren’t being violent. We weren’t screaming expletives at them.” The power wielded by police has long been justified with the claim that officers must be able to use force when necessary to protect themselves or the public, and that people who have done nothing wrong have nothing to fear. Black activists and their allies have been contesting that claim for years, but the tide of public opinion has been slow to turn against law enforcement. However, when officers fire tear gas and projectiles at soccer moms holding sunflowers, as happened in Portland on Sunday night, even more observers — who may not previously have thought they could be at risk — see that as a fate that might befall anyone. And history suggests that could have profound political consequences. In Argentina in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, women whose children had been “disappeared” by the military government — seized, tortured and murdered in secret — were the most visible opposition to the regime, with their distinctive white kerchiefs. They “continually pointed out that the majority of the disappeared were not terrorists, as the junta claimed, but loyal members of the opposition, including people who had never engaged in politics and even some members of the establishment,” the political scientist Marguerite Guzman Bouvard wrote in “Revolutionizing Motherhood,” her 2002 book on the group. “In shattering the lies that served as a rationale for the junta’s terror,” Dr. Bouvard wrote, “the Mothers exposed the glaring weakness of the entire system.” There are obvious differences between the Argentine dictatorship of and the United States today. But Ms. Gregory, the Portland mother who joined Sunday’s demonstration, was deeply disturbed by the federal officers’ violent response to the protest. “We weren’t any danger to them,” she said. “We were just standing there with flowers. We’re a bunch of middle-aged moms.” “This isn’t what America is supposed to be like,” she said. “We’re not supposed to be ruled by militarized, jackbooted forces.” Ms. Raiford, the longtime activist, is cautiously hopeful about the power of that message — and its messengers. “Sometimes when people hear activists say ‘Black lives matter,’ they say ‘well that has nothing to do with me.’” she said. “But when we talk about the intrinsic value of humanity, and how all of our lives intersect because we have children, we have families, we live in communities, we have loved ones, I think that that creates less of a barrier.” She hopes the attention on the moms will help to spread that message. “We don’t need silent victims,” she said. “We need loud witnesses.”']",When mothers take to the streets — particularly those from privileged groups — governments take note. The “wall of moms” in Portland has taken up the cause against police violence.
Quarantine Order Blindsides Britons Returning From Spain,2020-07-26,By Stephen Castle and Raphael Minder,"['LONDON — Often criticized for a slow response to the coronavirus, the British government moved quickly this weekend to impose a quarantine on anyone arriving from Spain, after a spike in Covid-19 cases there. But this time speed brought disarray to thousands of Britons, blindsiding those who have already gone to Spain and embarrassing Britain’s transportation secretary, Grant Shapps. He is responsible for aviation policy but learned of the quarantine while on his own vacation. In Spain. The abrupt decision means that Mr. Shapps, like others who left Britain assuming that they could return without restrictions will be required to isolate themselves for 14 days. Many who were about to depart Britain have been forced to rethink their plans. Some flights to Spain were canceled. And even those planning to head elsewhere were reminded that quarantine rules can change overnight. Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the decision had been made after a review of data received on Friday that showed a large jump in Spanish cases. “We took the decision as swiftly as we could,” Mr. Raab told Sky News. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government moved only recently to lift restrictions on those hoping for summer vacations abroad. Now the Foreign Office urges Britons to avoid all nonessential travel to mainland Spain, though it says it is “not advising those already traveling in Spain to leave at this time.” The Scottish government, which had lifted its quarantine rules for Spain just a few days ago, said it would reimpose them too. As a result, Britain’s biggest tour operator, Tui, said it was canceling all its vacations to mainland Spain until Aug. 9, though several airlines, including British Airways, were still offering flights. Airline officials expressed the frustration of a devastated sector, however. “\u200bThis is, sadly, yet another blow for British holidaymakers and cannot fail to have an impact on an already troubled aviation industry,” British Airways said in a statement, adding that the change was “throwing thousands of Britons’ travel plans into chaos.” For some of those still hoping to enjoy some Spanish sun, the viability of their vacations could depend on their employers’ willingness to let them stay at home for 14 days after their return. “The government’s policy regarding travel restrictions has lacked grip and coherence from the outset,” said Nick Thomas-Symonds, who speaks on home affairs issues for the opposition Labour Party. “This latest decision-making process regarding Spain and the short notice for travelers has created a sense of panic and loss of control.” Britons normally make up around one-fifth of foreign visitors to Spain, and the Spanish foreign minister called on Sunday for Britain to exclude at least Spain’s two archipelagoes — the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands — from its quarantine order. Both are major British tourist destinations and have had low Covid-19 caseloads throughout the epidemic. The foreign minister, Arancha González Laya, said on Sunday that Spain had brought its three major mainland outbreaks under control. From a high of about 8,000 confirmed new infections per day in early April, Spain dropped below 300 early this month. But in the last week, the daily average has topped 1,700 — as many as Britain, France and Italy combined — and, as in many places, experts say the real figure is higher, with many cases going undetected. On Friday, Norway also reimposed a quarantine for people arriving from Spain, while Belgium recommended the same for six of Spain’s 17 regions, as well as forbidding its citizens from traveling to two specific Spanish provinces, Huesca and Lleida. France on Friday advised against travel to Catalonia, Spain’s northeastern region bordering France, where hundreds of thousands of residents were put back under temporary lockdown this month. Since Spain ended its state of emergency on June 21, new outbreaks have underlined a continued shortfall in testing and contact tracing, making it harder to monitor and control the spread of the virus. Britain, too, has had problems with its track and trace system, and Mr. Johnson has been criticized for his handling of the crisis. Britain was slow to impose lockdowns or quarantine travelers; it eventually did both, but by late April it had the worst outbreak in western Europe. Earlier this month, with infections down sharply across the continent, Britain eased its rules, allowing people in dozens of countries, including Spain, to travel to England with no restrictions, though travelers from the United States are still required to observe the quarantine. That let thousands of Britons salvage summer vacation plans — or so they thought. According to British news media reports, Mr. Shapps had only recently arrived in Spain when he learned about the decision to reimpose a quarantine. According to Mr. Raab, who said he spoke to Mr. Shapps on Saturday, the transport secretary reacted philosophically to the move and agreed on the need for measures to protect the country. “I think it shows you that there are risks for everyone,” Mr. Raab said. Stephen Castle reported from London, and Raphael Minder from Madrid.']",Britain’s sudden decision to make travelers from Spain self-isolate for 14 days caught many vacationers by surprise — including the transportation secretary.
Officials Push U.S.-China Relations Toward Point of No Return,2020-07-25,By Edward Wong and Steven Lee Myers,"['WASHINGTON — Step by step, blow by blow, the United States and China are dismantling decades of political, economic and social engagement, setting the stage for a new era of confrontation shaped by the views of the most hawkish voices on both sides. With President Trump trailing badly in the polls as the election nears, his national security officials have intensified their attack on China in recent weeks, targeting its officials, diplomats and executives. While the strategy has reinforced a key campaign message, some American officials, worried Mr. Trump will lose, are also trying to engineer irreversible changes, according to people familiar with the thinking. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has inflamed the fight, brushing aside international concern about the country’s rising authoritarianism to consolidate his own political power and to crack down on basic freedoms, from Xinjiang to Hong Kong. By doing so, he has hardened attitudes in Washington, fueling a clash that at least some in China believe could be dangerous to the country’s interests. The combined effect could prove to be Mr. Trump’s most consequential foreign policy legacy, even if it’s not one he has consistently pursued: the entrenchment of a fundamental strategic and ideological confrontation between the world’s two largest economies. A state of broad and intense competition is the end goal of the president’s hawkish advisers. In their view, confrontation and coercion, aggression and antagonism should be the status quo with the Chinese Communist Party, no matter who is leading the United States next year. They call it “reciprocity.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared in a speech on Thursday that the relationship should be based on the principle of “distrust and verify,” saying that the diplomatic opening orchestrated by President Richard M. Nixon nearly half a century ago had ultimately undermined American interests. “We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come: that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won’t get it done,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We must not continue it and we must not return to it.” The events of the last week brought relations to yet another low, accelerating the downward spiral. On Tuesday, the State Department ordered China to shut down its Houston consulate, prompting diplomats there to burn documents in a courtyard. On Friday, in retaliation, China ordered the United States to close its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu. The Chinese Foreign Ministry the next day denounced what it called “forced entry” into the Houston consulate by U.S. law enforcement officers on Friday afternoon. In between, the Department of Justice announced criminal charges against four members of the People’s Liberation Army for lying about their status in order to operate as undercover intelligence operatives in the United States. All four have been arrested. One, Tang Juan, who was studying at the University of California, Davis, ignited a diplomatic standoff when she sought refuge in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, but was taken into custody on Thursday night. This comes on top of a month in which the administration announced sanctions on senior Chinese officials, including a member of the ruling Politburo, over the mass internment of Muslims; revoked the special status of Hong Kong in diplomatic and trade relations; and declared that China’s vast maritime claims in the South China Sea were illegal. The administration has also imposed a travel ban on Chinese students at graduate level or higher with ties to military institutions in China. Officials are discussing whether to do the same to members of the Communist Party and their families, a sweeping move that could put 270 million people on a blacklist. “Below the president, Secretary Pompeo and other members of the administration appear to have broader goals,” said Ryan Hass, a China director on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council who is now at the Brookings Institution. “They want to reorient the U.S.-China relationship toward an all-encompassing systemic rivalry that cannot be reversed by the outcome of the upcoming U.S. election,” he said. “They believe this reorientation is needed to put the United States on a competitive footing against its 21st-century geostrategic rival.” From the start, Mr. Trump has vowed to change the relationship with China, but mainly when it comes to trade. Early this year, the negotiated truce in the countries’ trade war was hailed by some aides as a signature accomplishment. That deal is still in effect, though hanging by a thread, overshadowed by the broader fight. Beyond China, few of the administration’s foreign policy goals have been fully achieved. Mr. Trump’s personal diplomacy with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, has done nothing to end the country’s nuclear weapons program. His withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has further alienated allies and made that country’s leaders even more belligerent. His effort to change the government in Venezuela failed. His promised withdrawal of all American troops from Afghanistan has yet to occur. In Beijing, some officials and analysts have publicly dismissed many of the Trump administration’s moves as campaign politics, accusing Mr. Pompeo and others of promoting a Cold War mentality to score points for an uphill re-election fight. There is a growing recognition, though, that the conflict’s roots run deeper. The breadth of the administration’s campaign has vindicated those in China — and possibly Mr. Xi himself — who have long suspected that the United States will never accept the country’s growing economic and military might, or its authoritarian political system. “It’s not just electoral considerations,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. “It is also a natural escalation and a result of the inherent contradictions between China and the United States.” Already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, some Chinese officials have sought to avoid open conflict with the United States. They have urged the Trump administration to reconsider each of its actions and called for cooperation, not confrontation, albeit without offering significant concessions of their own. “With global anti-China sentiment at its highest level in decades, Chinese officials have indicated an interest in exploring potential offramps to the current death spiral in U.S.-China relations,” said Jessica Chen Weiss, a political scientist at Cornell University who studies Chinese foreign policy and public opinion. “Beijing isn’t spoiling for an all-out fight with the United States,” she said, “but at a minimum the Chinese government will retaliate to show the world — and a prospective Biden administration — that China won’t be intimidated or pushed around.” Given the size of each nation’s economy and their entwinement, there are limits to the unwinding of relations, or what some Trump officials call “decoupling.” In the United States, tycoons and business executives, who exercise enormous sway among politicians of both parties, will continue to push for a more moderate approach, as members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet who represent Wall Street interests have done. China is making leaps in science, technology and education that Americans and citizens of other Western nations will want to share in. In his Thursday speech, even Mr. Pompeo acknowledged, “China is deeply integrated into the global economy.” Only two weeks ago, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on the United States to step back from confrontation and work with China. In reality, officials in Beijing appear resigned to the likelihood that nothing will change for the better before next year. “There is very little China can do to take the initiative,” said Wu Qiang, an independent analyst in Beijing. “It has very few proactive options.” Mr. Trump whipsaws in his language on China. He has called Mr. Xi “a very, very good friend” and even privately encouraged him to keep building mass internment camps for Muslims and handle the Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters his way, according to a new book by John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser. When he last spoke with Mr. Xi, he expressed “much respect!” on Twitter.  With the election looming, Mr. Trump’s tone has changed. He has returned to bashing China, as he did in 2016, blaming Beijing for the pandemic and even referring to the coronavirus with a racist phrase, “Kung Flu.” His campaign aides have made aggressive rhetoric on China a pillar of their strategy, believing it could help energize voters. The heated language, combined with the administration’s policy actions, could actually be having a galvanizing effect on Chinese citizens, some analysts and political figures in Beijing say. “I strongly urge American people to re-elect Trump because his team has many crazy members like Pompeo,” Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalist newspaper Global Times, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “They help China strengthen solidarity and cohesion in a special way.” The relationship might not change course even if former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. defeats Mr. Trump in November. The idea of orienting American policy toward competition with China has had robust bipartisan support over the last three-and-a-half years. The Chinese government’s initial mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak and its actions in Hong Kong, which is widely seen as a beacon of liberal values within China, have been signal moments this year, contributing to the tectonic shift in views across the political spectrum. The China hawks in the administration have seized on them to publicly push their perspective: that the Chinese Communist Party seeks to expand its ideology and authoritarian vision worldwide, and that citizens of liberal nations must wake up to the dangers and gird themselves for a conflict that could last for decades. Since late June, the administration has rolled out four top officials to make that case. Attorney General William P. Barr accused American companies of “corporate appeasement,” while Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, said his agency was opening a new China-related counterintelligence investigation every 10 hours. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, warned that the Chinese Communist Party aimed to remake the world in its image. “The effort to control thought beyond the borders of China is well underway,” he said. Mr. Pompeo’s speech on Thursday was meant as the punctuation mark. He chose the presidential library of the man credited with opening up U.S.-China relations to declare the policy a failure. “President Nixon once said he feared he had created a ‘Frankenstein’ by opening the world to the C.C.P.,” Mr. Pompeo said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party, “and here we are.” Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul, South Korea. Claire Fu contributed research from Beijing.']",Top aides to President Trump want to leave a lasting legacy of ruptured ties between the two powers. China’s aggression has been helping their cause.
"Vietnam, Lauded in Coronavirus Fight, Has First Local Case in 100 Days",2020-07-25,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — Vietnam, which had gone 100 days without reporting a case of local transmission of the coronavirus, said on Saturday that a 57-year-old grandfather in the central city of Danang had tested positive. How he got the illness remains a mystery. To prevent a wider outbreak, the Health Ministry said it was conducting “extensive screening and testing in all at-risk areas in Danang.” Officials said they had tested and quarantined people who had been in close contact with the patient and were tracing others. So far, no other positive cases have surfaced. The case of the Danang grandfather is yet another sign of how difficult it is to contain the virus even when a country has followed the best practices. The patient has no record of recent travel and appears to be a homebody who spends most of his time looking after his grandchildren. Health officials, noting that mask use in Vietnam had become lax, urged members of the public to resume wearing them, especially in crowded places and on public transportation. Vietnam, one of the world’s few remaining communist states, has been among the most successful in the world in containing the virus. Soon after the illness emerged in China, Vietnam’s northern neighbor, the government quickly closed international borders, called for widespread use of masks and established strict quarantine and aggressive contact-tracing procedures. Most foreigners are still barred from traveling to Vietnam, and returning citizens are required to go into quarantine, which is where all of Vietnam’s other recent cases have been found. The public has embraced the campaign and rallied around one famous case, that of Scottish pilot, Stephen Cameron, 43, who came so close to death that doctors in Ho Chi Minh City contemplated giving him a double-lung transplant. He spent more than two months on life support in a medically induced coma but recovered and flew home two weeks ago. As of Saturday, Vietnam had reported 416 cases and no deaths. Its last known case of local transmission was in mid-April. The government has been considering resuming international flights to countries where the virus has been contained. The discovery of the new case in Danang was a shock. Many people reportedly canceled travel plans in central Vietnam, a popular destination for domestic and foreign travelers. The 57-year-old man, known as Patient 416, first showed signs of a cough and fever on July 17 and was admitted to a hospital three days later. He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia. An X-ray showed lung lesions and, after he suffered respiratory failure, he was put on a ventilator. His tests for Covid-19 were positive from the outset, but it was not until Saturday, when the fourth test result came back, that the government officially declared that he had Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The country’s acting health minister, Nguyen Thanh Long, confirmed the finding at a meeting on Saturday of the National Steering Committee for Covid-19. Health investigators concluded that the patient had not traveled outside Danang, one of Vietnam’s largest cities, and had rarely left home in the month before becoming ill. On July 7, he took his 92-year-old mother to a medical center for treatment for her heart ailment and, on July 16, visited her at the hospital where she had been transferred. On July 17, he began to feel tired and feverish but attended an engagement party. The next day, he went to a family wedding. Health officials said that more than 100 people with whom he had been in contact had tested negative for the virus. About 50 of them have been placed in isolation as a further precaution. Specialist teams were sent from other parts of the country, including from Cho Ray Hospital, where Mr. Cameron was treated, to help with the treatment of Patient 416, whose condition appeared to be deteriorating. “This patient is suffering from acute pneumonia with severe symptoms and rapid progression,” according to a statement posted on Friday by the Health Ministry, and doctors were pursuing “a maximum treatment regimen.” Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi.']","A 57-year-old grandfather in the city of Danang, with no history of travel, tested positive and has been hospitalized.

"Research Boosts Evidence of Masks’ Utility, Some Experts Say",2020-07-27,,"['Read our live Coronavirus Pandemic coverage here.  Researchers have long known that masks can prevent people from spreading airway germs to others. But now experts are pointing to evidence suggesting that masks also protect the people wearing them, lessening the severity of symptoms, or in some instances, staving off infection entirely. Different kinds of masks “block virus to a different degree, but they all block the virus from getting in,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco. If any virus particles do breach these barriers, she said, the disease might still be milder. Dr. Gandhi and her colleagues make this argument in a paper to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. Drawing from animal experiments and observations of various events during the pandemic, they contend that people wearing face coverings will take in fewer coronavirus particles. Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the work, cautioned that the links between masking and milder disease haven’t yet been proved as cause and effect.  Ideas about the importance of viral dose in the development of disease have cropped up in the medical literature since at least the 1930s. More recently, scientists have gone as far as to puff different amounts of a flu virus up the noses of human volunteers. The more virus in this nasal plume, they found, the likelier the participants were to get infected and experience symptoms. That sort of experiment can’t be done ethically for the new coronavirus, given how dangerous it is. But earlier this year, a team of researchers in China tried something similar in hamsters: They housed coronavirus-infected and healthy animals in adjoining cages, some of which were separated by buffers made of surgical masks. Many of the healthy hamsters behind the partitions never got infected. And the unlucky animals who did got less sick than their “maskless” neighbors. Rules around mask wearing have been highly politicized. President Trump spent months questioning their utility and refusing to wear one in public, though he has recently changed course.  Another of summer’s most cherished rites was upended by the pandemic on Monday when the attempted return of Major League Baseball hit a snag, as the Miami Marlins postponed their home opener after 14 members of the team tested positive for the coronavirus. The troubled return of the national pastime, after months of careful planning, was only the latest sign that the virus, instead of ebbing over the summer as officials had once hoped it would, is spreading at record levels across wide sections of the United States. A month that began with canceled July 4 fireworks displays across the country and sporadic beach closures has continued with edicts shutting down the bars of Bourbon Street in New Orleans and the dance floors of Nashville. Now a new round of cancellations — including the Marlins game and a Phillies game in Philadelphia, where the visiting Yankees would have had to use the same clubhouse that the Marlins had — is continuing to disrupt summer life. The infections, and postponements, cast a pall over baseball’s plans to attempt a 60-game season using 30 stadiums, including a ballpark in Buffalo for the Toronto Blue Jays, who were barred from playing home games by the Canadian government because of the risk of travel to and from the United States. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, warned early on about how the pandemic would transform professional sports. He threw out the first pitch at baseball’s opening game last Thursday between the Yankees and Washington Nationals, an image featured on a limited-edition Topps NOW baseball card that Topps said sold 51,512 copies during its 24-hour offering.  Topps said that the demand for the card was more than double the previous record for a Topps NOW card, which was 19,396 copies of a Vladimir Guerrero Jr. card in 2019. There will also be no summer blockbuster at the local movie theater: “Tenet,” the Christopher Nolan thriller that Warner Bros. had hoped would lure fans back to multiplexes this month, has been postponed until Sept. 4, the beginning of Labor Day weekend. The political blockbusters planned for later this summer — the national conventions — will be unrecognizable from in years past. President Trump said last week that he was bowing to the reality of the virus and canceling the convention activities he had tried to move to Jacksonville, Fla., after officials in North Carolina, where they were initially supposed to be held, had insisted on enforcing health guidelines. And Democrats have long been working on a scaled-back convention in Milwaukee where they plan to nominate Joseph R. Biden Jr.  One of the other big television events of the summer — the Olympics — is off, too. Tokyo, where the games were supposed to be underway right now, instead finds itself grappling with record numbers of new cases on several recent days.  Even the unofficial end of summer — the start of the school year — is being postponed in many districts, where officials say that they need more time to prepare for classes, which will be held in person in some places and online in others. President Trump shared on his Twitter account Monday night a viral video containing a series of false or misleading medical claims about the coronavirus, as social media companies scrambled to halt the video’s rapid spread. Facebook and YouTube removed versions of the video, and Twitter later removed the post shared by the president. At least one version, which was shared on Facebook by the right-wing Breitbart news site, had garnered over 13 million views before it was removed. Other versions of the video, including shorter, edited clips, were still online Monday night.   The video featured what appeared to be a group of doctors in white coats, standing in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., in what appeared to be a news conference. The doctors made a series of misleading claims, including that hydroxychloroquine could be taken as a preventive measure.  The use of the drug to treat or prevent coronavirus has been widely disputed by the medical establishment. The Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency authorization in June after deeming it “unlikely to be effective” while carrying potential risks, and the National Institutes of Health halted clinical trials of the drug in June. But Mr. Trump repeatedly boosted the drug in the early months of the crisis, and said in June he was taking it himself.   It was the most recent example of misinformation that has spread about the coronavirus, at times being shared by Mr. Trump and others in the White House. A YouTube spokesman said in a statement that the video had been removed for “violating Covid-19 misinformation policies.” Republicans are seeking a $400-per-week reduction in unemployment benefits in their $1 trillion economic recovery package, initially lowering the extra federal payments for tens of millions of jobless Americans from $600 to $200, according to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. The proposal to slash the jobless aid by two-thirds, part of a Republican plan they began rolling out on Monday afternoon, is likely to be among the most bitterly contested issues in bipartisan negotiations over the next round of pandemic relief. Democrats support a $3 trillion package that includes extending the $600-per-week federal payments, which expire on Friday, through the end of the year. Many Republicans detest the supplement to state jobless aid, put in place by the $2.2 trillion stimulus law, arguing that it is a disincentive to returning to work because it exceeds what some workers can earn in regular wages. The Republican proposal, which has badly divided the party, envisions eventually shifting to a new system of calculating benefits that would cap payments at about 70 percent of a worker’s prior income, which would also amount to about $200 per week. It also proposes another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans. In a nod to the long odds of striking a deal before the benefits expire on Friday, administration officials continue to float the prospect of speeding through a much narrower bill that would extend extra jobless aid, provide funding for schools and enact new liability shields for operating businesses. But Democrats have rejected that idea, saying it would sap momentum for other crucial relief measures. Democratic leaders left a nearly two-hour meeting with White House officials on Monday evening saying they were unsatisfied with the opening bid Republicans had put forward and all but taunting their Senate counterparts for struggling to coalesce around a proposal. “If they’re not even getting to the fundamentals of food and rent and economic survival, they’re not really ready to have a serious negotiation,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said after nearly two hours of meeting with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff; and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. Mr. Schumer added, “We hope they can get their act together — we very much want to get something done for the needs of the people.” Mr. Meadows, as he left Ms. Pelosi’s office with Mr. Mnuchin, declared it a good meeting and said the pair would return on Tuesday. Both Democratic leaders said they planned to carefully review the Republican offer overnight. Even as the virus rages across much of the nation, forcing many states to slow or reverse their reopenings, President Trump said on Monday that more states should be opening up. During a visit to a North Carolina biotechnology lab, Mr. Trump boasted that progress toward a vaccine was “substantially ahead of schedule” and that a breakthrough would lead to a “tremendous” economic recovery.  In the next breath, Mr. Trump complained that “a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening, and we’ll see what happens with them.” It was something of a return to form for Mr. Trump, who has long pressed states to reopen, downplaying the threat of the virus, but who had seemed to shift last week when he declared at the White House that the virus “will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.” But on Monday, Mr. Trump also urged Americans to “especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wears masks when appropriate.” And he then donned a mask himself for a subsequent tour of the lab facility, where researchers are making components for a potential vaccine. Mr. Trump spoke after the White House announced that his national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, had tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the most senior White House official known to have contracted the virus. In a statement, the White House said that Mr. O’Brien “has mild symptoms” and is working remotely from “a secure location off site.” Mr. O’Brien typically works from a West Wing office that is steps away from the Oval Office. It is unclear when he was last in contact with Mr. Trump, although he joined him on a July 10 trip to Florida. A photo of Mr. O’Brien taken after he left the plane in Miami shows him without a mask. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, made it clear during a visit to Tennessee on Monday that she believed that everyone in the state should be required to wear masks — but she stopped short of publicly asking its governor to issue a statewide mandate. “We need 100 percent of the counties, including the rural counties, to have these mandates,” Dr. Birx said during a news conference. Then the state’s governor, Bill Lee, a Republican, took to the lectern and was asked if Dr. Birx had pressed him to issue a statewide mandate. “We talked about statewide mandates. We also talked about alternative approaches,” he said. Tennessee reported 2,871 new cases on Sunday, the most it has reported in a single day, according to a New York Times database. It was another example of how the nation’s patchwork of rules and recommendations at different levels of government has complicated efforts to control the virus. Federal health officials issue guidelines and make recommendations, but state and local officials do not always follow them. Mr. Trump has been dismissive of or slow to promote some federal recommendations — it took weeks for him to appear in a mask after health experts called for face coverings — and suggested on Monday that more governors should reopen.   As Kentucky officials weighed new restrictions, Dr. Birx said over the weekend that the leaders of nearby states should consider doing the same by closing bars again and issuing restrictions on public gatherings “to really make it possible to control the pandemic before it gets worse.” Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said Monday that the state’s bars would have to close again to slow the spread, about a month after they had reopened.  He also reduced the legal restaurant capacity from 50 percent to 25 percent, and issued an informal recommendation that schools wait until the third week of August to resume in-person classes. Kentucky had already implemented two other recommendations put forward by Dr. Birx: requiring face masks for public indoor spaces, and limiting social gatherings to 10 people. “I don’t want to be a state where casket makers are running out,” Mr. Beshear said. States in the South and Midwest are facing the prospect of shutting down parts of their economies again to try to stem the virus, which the Trump administration and many governors have increasingly been forced to recognize as unrelenting. Florida has surpassed New York, an early center of the pandemic in the United States when testing was scarce, in the number of known cases. And on Monday, Oklahoma and New Mexico broke state records for single-day cases. Texas became the fourth state to record over 400,000 total cases, after California, Florida and New York. And despite increased testing capacity across the nation, there is a consensus among federal state and local officials that test results are taking too long. Britain will crack down on junk food advertising and introduce calorie counts on menus in an effort to tackle obesity and ease the pressure on the country’s National Health Service amid the coronavirus pandemic, the government said on Monday. For the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the intersection of obesity and the coronavirus is personal. Mr. Johnson was, by his own admission, “way overweight” when he was admitted to the hospital after becoming ill with Covid-19 this year, and his health deteriorated to such an extent that at one point he needed intensive care. Studies have linked obesity to a greater risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19, and Mr. Johnson, writing in the British newspaper The Daily Express, described his time in hospital as a “wake-up call.” “We all put things off — I know I have,” Mr. Johnson wrote. “I’ve wanted to lose weight for ages and like many people I struggle with my weight.” As part of the government’s new obesity strategy, advertisements for any food high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned on television and online until 9 p.m. to avoid hours when children are most likely to see them. There will also be a consultation on whether Britain should entirely ban online ads for junk food. All large restaurants and cafes will be required to add a calorie count to their menus, and the government will look into adding calorie labels to alcoholic drinks. Promotional offers like “buy one, get one free” on fatty or sugary foods will also be prohibited. Instead of the welcome that a tourism-hungry island would usually extend, travelers to Puerto Rico over the weekend encountered angry protesters outside the San Juan airport, demanding that the airport be closed to tourists. The protesters’ complaint: Too many visitors have been blithely ignoring social-distancing precautions and mask mandates. A caravan of cars honking their horns, with protesters holding up signs, blocked traffic into the airport, and some protesters on foot clashed with police. “We are going to continue with this caravan and with this fight, because this is a question of life or death,” one protester, Ricardo Santos Ortiz, said on WAPA-TV Saturday. Puerto Rico reopened to tourism July 15, but a day later Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced reversed course, pushing the opening off for a month and shutting many businesses down again, because coronavirus cases were soaring on the island. That has not stopped tourists from arriving anyway, often flying in from virus hot spots around the U.S. to vacation in one of the few tropical getaways that Americans can visit now. About 12,000 people have flown to San Juan from Miami so far in July, five times as many as in April, according to Greg Chin, a spokesperson for Miami International Airport. José Reyes of the Puerto Rico National Guard said in a televised interview last week that only about 20 percent of arriving visitors were complying with Puerto Rico’s requirement that they have a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours. Puerto Rico shut down early, before any U.S. state, and managed to avoid a major coronavirus outbreak in the spring. But its daily case counts have soared in the last two weeks, and residents say the influx of tourists is to blame for much of the rise. Videos of unmasked tourists dancing in the streets and scuffling at the airport have recently gone viral, and some businesses have called the police to deal with tourists who became aggressive when asked to wear a mask. Though the island’s hotels are open, much else is shut down, including hotel swimming pools, casinos and tourist attractions; beaches are closed except for solo exercise. One of the first large studies of safety and effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine in the United States began on Monday, according to the National Institutes of Health and the biotech company Moderna, which collaborated to develop the vaccine. The first shot was given to a person at 6:45 a.m., Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infections disease expert, told reporters. The study, a Phase 3 clinical trial, will enroll 30,000 healthy people at about 89 sites around the country. Half will receive two shots of the vaccine, 28 days apart, and half will receive two shots of a saltwater placebo. Neither the volunteers nor the medical staff giving the injections will know who is getting the real vaccine. Dr. Fauci estimated that the trial’s full enrollment of 30,000 will be completed by the end of the summer, and that results might be available by November. Even earlier results might be possible, he said, but added that he doubted that would be the case. A second company, Pfizer, announced Monday afternoon that it would also begin a late-stage study of a coronavirus vaccine, on Tuesday. Pfizer has been working with a German company, BioNTech. Their study will also include 30,000 people, from 39 states in the United States, and from Brazil, Argentina and Germany. The government announced last week that it had reached a $1.95 billion deal to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine by the year’s end, but only if the trial proves it safe and effective. At the news briefing, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said that at least three other Phase 3 trials would be starting soon, each needing 30,000 patients. Those trials will involve vaccines made by Novavax, by a collaboration of the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, and by Johnson & Johnson. All are part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed.  Once volunteers are vaccinated, researchers will be looking for side effects and waiting to see if the vaccine significantly lowers cases of Covid-19. The study will also try to find out if it can prevent severe Covid-19 cases and death; if it can prevent infection entirely, based on lab tests; and if just one shot can prevent the illness. Earlier tests of the vaccine showed that it stimulated a strong immune response, with minor and transient side effects like sore arms, fatigue, achiness and fever. But exactly what type of immune response is needed to prevent the illness is not known, so Phase 3 studies are essential to determine whether a vaccine really works. Long Beach Island, a popular summertime destination along the Jersey Shore, is now a different kind of hot spot. Thirty-five lifeguards from two boroughs on the barrier island — Surf City and Harvey Cedars — recently tested positive for the coronavirus, the island’s health department announced on Monday. Public health officials said that half of the lifeguards were experiencing mild symptoms and the rest were asymptomatic. None were hospitalized, the officials said. The outbreak was traced to two social gatherings that the lifeguards attended on July 12 and July 14, according to the Long Beach Island Health Department, which said it dispatched nurses to investigate cases and issue quarantine orders.  “Based on our investigation so far, the workplace was not the source of transmission and practices likely prevented additional cases,” the Health Department said in a news release on Monday. “The youth and young adults should recognize they are not immune to this virus.” During a daily briefing on the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey mentioned the outbreak on Long Beach Island and said he was troubled by reports of large social gatherings of young people. “This is among us, folks,” Mr. Murphy said. “Any of us who thinks we can just put our feet up and relax and let this take its course is not paying attention, particularly congregating inside, in close proximity, poor ventilation, without face coverings. You’re looking for trouble. You’re absolutely looking for trouble, no matter how old you are.” In Harvey Cedars, 18 of 73 lifeguards were infected, according to the borough’s website, which said that its beaches were still open and fully staffed. The lifeguards who tested positive for the virus will not be allowed to return to work until they meet the safety protocols set by the island’s health department, according to a post on the borough’s website. It was not immediately clear what those protocols are. When reached by phone on Monday evening, the mayor of Surf City, Francis R. Hodgson Sr., refused to comment.  On Long Beach Island, only one lifeguard is allowed in a lifeguard stand under social distancing guidelines that the island’s Health Department said it implemented at the start of the season. Lifeguards must report directly to their stand, and communal activities are barred, health officials said. The doctor who supplied the data for two discredited Covid-19 studies had a history of cutting corners and misrepresenting information as he pursued his ambitions, former colleagues say. In May, Dr. Sapan Desai published two high-profile studies, including one that found that anti-malaria drugs promoted by President Trump had harmed patients being treated for Covid-19. The study almost instantly disrupted multiple clinical trials amid the pandemic. (The Food and Drug Administration said that hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to be safe and effective and should not be used outside clinical trials.) Last month, both studies were retracted by the medical journals that had published them, after researchers around the world suggested the data was dubious. Dr. Desai, who declined to share the raw data even with his co-authors, claimed it was culled from a massive trove acquired by Surgisphere, a business he started during his residency. The New York Times interviewed more than two dozen people who have known Dr. Desai over the past two decades. He has cast himself as an ambitious physician, an entrepreneur with an M.B.A. and a prolific researcher published in medical journals. But more than a dozen doctors who worked with him during training and residency said they had often found him to be an unreliable physician, who seemed less interested in patient care than in his company and a medical journal he founded. “You couldn’t trust what he said,” said Dr. Vanessa Olcese, a former chief resident who worked with Dr. Desai at Duke University Medical Center. U.S. ROUNDUP Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told employees Monday that they would not be expected back in the office until mid-2021. The company’s work force, which has been working remotely since March, had previously been told to expect a return to offices in January 2021. A Google spokesman said: “To give employees the ability to plan ahead, we are extending our global voluntary work from home option through June 30, 2021, for roles that don’t need to be in the office.” Technology companies moved quickly with work-from-home policies, and have been reluctant to bring workers back too early. In May, Facebook said it would allow many employees to work from home permanently. In other developments around the United States: Washington, D.C., said travelers should quarantine themselves for 14 days if they arrive from 27 “high-risk” states that meet certain criteria, including California, Florida and Texas. Residents in nearby Maryland and Virginia — which are both seeing increased numbers of cases — are exempted from the order. People arriving after essential travel in those states or arriving in Washington for essential travel should self-monitor. Many states across the United States have added restrictions on incoming travelers in hopes of curbing the spread of the virus. The Labor Department has been struggling to process a pileup of compensation claims from federal workers who have fallen ill with the coronavirus, according to an audit by the department’s inspector general. The department expects to have received roughly 6,000 claims by next Tuesday, and has been slow to sift through the ones it has received already, according to the report: As of June 16, the department had processed only 911 of the 2,866 claims it had received. Twenty-three states are going ahead with in-person bar exams — the grueling tests that aspiring lawyers must pass to practice — on Tuesday and Wednesday, despite the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the country. Most of the states are in the South or Midwest; many, like Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma, have seen sharp recent rises in case reports. The danger posed by having numerous test-takers sitting in the same rooms for hours has prompted many other states to postpone the exam until later in the year, switch to administering it online, or both. Some states that usually give the exam in early September have also announced postponements. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a $52 million grant from the federal government aimed at slowing the virus’s rampage through the states’s Central Valley, where residents of predominantly Latino communities have consistently been required to keep showing up at work in fields or meatpacking plants and warehouses. The money will go toward more focused testing efforts to identify outbreaks, education for employees and employers about rights to sick leave and other safety issues, as well as improvements to quarantine and isolation protocols. State officials in Texas changed their methodology for reporting coronavirus deaths on Monday, causing a spike in their data. More than 6,000 people in Texas are now known to have died from the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database that uses state and county data, an increase of more than 1,000 since Sunday. The gym chain Planet Fitness announced Monday that guests would be required to wear masks at all times while inside its facilities, effective Aug. 1. The announcement follows similar policies by national chains in recent weeks. Planet Fitness opened its 2,000th gym in December 2019. George Washington University announced on Monday that all undergraduate classes would be taught online this fall as the number of cases rises in Washington, D.C.,  Maryland and Virginia. The university said it would provide on-campus housing to a limited number of students with extenuating personal or academic circumstances. (An earlier version of this briefing reported erroneously that Georgetown University would also be holding all classes online.) The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference said it would cancel fall sports competition because of virus concerns, including men’s and women’s soccer, women’s volleyball, and men’s and women’s cross country. It joined the Ivy League and the Patriot League in placing sports on hold. The surge in coronavirus infections in Missouri has temporarily shut down Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis, less than a month before the fall semester was set to begin, because of a cluster of reported infections among campus employees. The historically black university conducted all its summer classes online this year, so there were few students and faculty members on the campus. But a smattering of other university employees have been working there since May, and the city of St. Louis and the surrounding county have been reporting high rates of infection. Across France, thousands of winemakers, famous and obscure, are facing moments of heartbreak. The economic crisis, combined with the Trump administration’s 25 percent tax on French wines in a trade war dispute with Europe, has collapsed the wine market. So some of the wine for which France is famous will wind up as hand sanitizer. The 2020 harvest, blessed by abundant sunshine, is barely a month away. The wine vats must be emptied for the new production. The distillery is the only option. “We’re producing more than we can sell,” said Thibaut Specht, a winemaker in Alsace. “We have no choice.” Marion Borès’s family business, Domaine Borès, in Reichsfeld, is sending off half its production — 320,000 liters — to a distiller for conversion into alcohol for sanitizer. “It’s like you are saying goodbye to somebody who is very dear to you,” she said. GLOBAL ROUNDUP After North Korea on Sunday accused a man of secretly crossing into the country from South Korea and bringing the virus with him, Seoul went in search of any defectors \u200bin \u200bthe South who were missing. By Monday, South Korean officials had zeroed in on a 24-year-old man, identified only by his family name, Kim, who in 2017 swam across the western inter-Korea border to defect to the South. On July 19, he swam back across the border into Kaesong in the North, they said. It was not immediately clear why the defector had crossed. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the man had been wanted by the South Korean police for questioning after a rape accusation. North Korea said on Sunday that the North Korean man was “suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus” and could be the country’s first case. And the reverse defection prompted the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to order a total lockdown of Kaesong, a border city of 300,000, and declare a “maximum” national emergency. Until Sunday, North Korea had \u200brepeatedly \u200bsaid that it had no Covid-19 cases. The claim was questioned by outside experts. South Korea officials could not say whether the man might have \u200bcarried the virus across the border. In other news from around the world: Vietnam, which on Saturday broke a streak of 100 days without a local virus transmission, will evacuate 80,000 people from the central city of Danang after four residents there tested positive this weekend. Hong Kong will prohibit dining in restaurants, limit public gatherings to two people and require mask-wearing in public at all times, officials said on Monday, reacting to a spike in coronavirus cases. The territory reported 145 cases on Monday, its highest single-day count since the pandemic began. Belgium’s prime minister reinstated strict social-distancing rules on Monday, saying she was taking aggressive steps to avoid another lockdown. She ordered Belgians not to socialize with more than five people and restricted all shopping visits to 30 minutes. Such measures were in place this spring, as Belgium was just emerging from a strict lockdown. Belgium’s infection numbers remain small but are increasing quickly, particularly in the second-largest city, Antwerp. Lebanon on Monday ordered bars, houses of worship, cinemas, sporting events and markets to close for two weeks as part of a lockdown after a surge in infections, Reuters reported, citing state media accounts. Some shops, banks and schools will be allowed to open, but only for two days a week. The virus has been surging across Zambia, with the government announcing a record number of cases. Last week, the authorities also said that 15 lawmakers and 11 members of staff had tested positive. The Australian Open, the premier golf tournament on the PGA Australasia Tour, won’t be played this year because of the pandemic, Golf Australia announced. The event, which is in its 105th year, had been scheduled for November. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said Monday that the coronavirus was “easily the most severe” global health emergency that the organization has declared. He defended how the W.H.O. has handled it from critics including Mr. Trump, who have accused it of being slow to sound the alarm, and added that the pandemic “has shown what humans are capable of, both positively and negatively.” Reporting was contributed by Julie Bosman, Stephen Castle, Troy Closson, Emily Cochrane, Lindsey Rogers Cook, Michael Cooper, Michael Crowley, Nicholas Fandos, Julia Echikson, Sheera Frenkel, Gillian Friedman, Ellen Gabler, Kevin Granville, Denise Grady, Rebecca Halleck, Shawn Hubler, Choe Sang-Hun, Tyler Kepner, Patrick J.

"Flooding in India Kills Scores of Animals, Including Endangered Rhinos",2020-07-25,By The Associated Press,"['GAUHATI, India — More than 100 animals, including 10 one-horned rhinoceroses, have died in massive flooding at the famed Kaziranga game reserve in northeastern India, officials said. The flooding prompted Britain’s Prince William and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, to express their concern in a letter to park authorities, officials said on Saturday. “Since the first week of June, we are having no respite with wave after wave of flood that has wreaked havoc inside the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve,” said Kaziranga’s park director, P. Sivakumar. He said an animal that had drowned in a swollen river near the park on Saturday brought the death toll of the endangered rhinoceroses up to 10. The British royal couple, known formally as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, wrote to Mr. Sivakumar expressing their distress about the devastation to the park and its precious wildlife. The couple had visited the park in 2016 to learn about conservation and anti-poaching efforts. “The deaths of so many animals, including one-horned rhino, are deeply upsetting,” they wrote. The flooding is the result of a monsoon that has dumped rain across parts of India, Bangladesh and Nepal, displacing 9.6 million people, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. More than 550 people have been killed in the floods, the group said. The organization warned of a humanitarian crisis, saying that close to one third of Bangladesh has already been flooded, with more flooding expected in the coming weeks. It said that 2.8 million people have been affected, and that more than 1 million were isolated. In India, more than 6.8 million people have been affected by the flooding, mainly in the northern states of Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Meghalaya bordering Bangladesh, the group said, citing official figures. In Bihar, at least 10 people have been killed, the state’s disaster management authority said on Saturday. In Assam, home to Kaziranga, 96 people have been killed in floods and another 26 have been killed in mudslides. Some 50,000 people have sought shelter in government-run relief camps.']","The flooding at the famous Kaziranga game reserve has drawn the attention of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who had visited the park to learn about its conservation efforts."
"Brazil’s Bolsonaro, Leading Virus Skeptic, Says He’s No Longer Infected",2020-07-25,By Ernesto Londoño,"['RIO DE JANEIRO — President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said Saturday that he had been cured of the coronavirus, appearing to have suffered only mild symptoms from a scourge he has repeatedly downplayed even as it rippled through the country, killing more than 86,000 people. “GOOD MORNING EVERYONE,” Mr. Bolsonaro, 65, posted in a message on Twitter Saturday morning, with the news that his latest coronavirus test had come back negative. The message included a photo of the president in which he appears to be smiling and giving a thumbs up while brandishing a box of hydroxychloroquine pills, the anti-malaria medicine. Mr. Bolsonaro has hailed the drug as a miracle cure, despite a growing scientific consensus that it is not effective to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Mr. Bolsonaro said he experienced body aches and a fever in the days before he first tested positive for the virus on July 7. Since then, he has projected an image of vitality as he roamed the grounds of the presidential residence in Brasília, at times playing with large birds that live on the estate. Shortly after announcing the test result, Mr. Bolsonaro left the palace riding a motorcycle, accompanied by security aides. He posed for photos with supporters before heading to a motorcycle shop. Mr. Bolsonaro’s cavalier handling of the pandemic has contributed to a national response that public health experts regard as one of the worst in the world. He sabotaged quarantine measures imposed by governors by attending rallies, shaking hands in public and urging Brazilians to continue working. The president called the virus a “measly cold” and said he had little to fear in the event that he became infected because his “athletic background” would enable him to bounce back quickly. Soon after his diagnosis, some Brazilians who are critical of the president expressed hope that he would suffer serious complications, and a few openly said they hoped it would kill him. Yet, the president’s seemingly mild case is vindicating his approach, in the eyes of supporters. “The president’s test results are back,” an allied lawmaker, Carlos Jordy, wrote on Twitter. “Positive for re-elected president in 2022.” Mr. Bolsonaro’s effusive promotion of hydroxychloroquine in social media posts during his recovery made it seem at times as if he was starring in an infomercial for the drug, which has been among the biggest flash points in Brazil’s chaotic response to the pandemic. On Friday a photo of the president appearing to offer hydroxychloroquine to one of the emu-like birds in his garden became the subject of memes. But many in Brazil find little humor in the president’s social media antics as the pandemic continues to kill hundreds of people daily and the economy sputters. As of Saturday, according to the Brazilian government, the country had 2.39 million confirmed cases and more than 86,449 deaths attributable to the virus, second only to the United States, which has 4.1 million cases and more than 145,000 deaths.']","President Jair M.

"Taliban Executes Female Prison Guard, and U.N. Raises Concern Over Afghan Violence",2020-07-27,By Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban abducted and executed a female prison guard in the eastern Afghan province of Ghazni, officials and relatives said Monday, as the United Nations expressed concern over the war’s unending toll on civilians. Fatima Rajabi, 23, who had trained as a police officer, was pulled out of a civilian minibus on her way to her home village in the Jaghori district two weeks ago. After holding her captive for two weeks, the Taliban executed the young woman and sent her body to her family, her brother, Samiullah Rajabi, said. “My sister was shot eight times,” Mr. Rajabi said. “When we opened the coffin, her hands were behind her, together and stiff — you could tell her hands were first tied and they had only untied them after they sent the body.” The United Nations, in a report released on Monday on civilian harm in the Afghan conflict in the first six months of the year, expressed particular concern about the rise of abductions and executions by the Taliban. There has been an increase of more than a fivefold in civilian casualties tied to abductions since last year, it said. Nearly 1,300 civilians have been killed and close 2,200 others wounded in the first six months of the year, according to the United Nations, which attributed 43 percent of the civilian casualties to the Taliban and 23 percent to Afghan forces. It said the insurgent violence had grown deadlier, with a 33 percent increase in deaths caused by the Taliban over the same time period last year. Women and children made up about 40 percent of the overall dead and injured, with pro-government forces responsible for the death of more children than the Taliban, the United Nations said. Civilian casualties from airstrikes by Afghan forces tripled from the first half of 2019. “The reality remains that Afghanistan continues to be one of the deadliest conflicts in the world for civilians,” the report noted. “Each year, thousands of civilians are killed and injured, abducted, displaced and threatened by parties to the conflict in Afghanistan.” The numbers still marked an overall 13 percent reduction in civilian casualties — which accounts for injuries and deaths — from the same period last year. That is largely attributed to a major drop in casualties from United State airstrikes and attacks by the Islamic State branch in the country, which has shrunk significantly after major military operations. As part of a withdrawal deal signed with the Taliban in February, the United States is no longer deploying its air power against the group except in extreme cases, such as when their Afghan allies are being routed. Although the United States has reduced its troops in the country to about 8,600 — it is on schedule to complete a full withdrawal over a 14-month period laid out in the agreement — other elements of the peace agreement, mainly direct negotiations between the Afghan sides over future power-sharing, have stalled as the violence continues. “At a time when the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban have a historic opportunity to come together at the negotiating table for peace talks, the tragic reality is that the fighting continues inflicting terrible harm to civilians every day,” said Deborah Lyons, the U.N. secretary-general’s special representative for Afghanistan. Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States’ special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, has begun another trip to meet with the Taliban’s negotiating team, based in Doha, and Afghan leaders in Kabul and push for direct negotiations, the State Department said. Those negotiations were expected to begin in March, but were delayed by disagreements over a prisoner swap under which the Afghan government was expected to free 5,000 Taliban fighters in return for 1,000 of its forces. Jaghori, where Ms. Rajabi was traveling to see her family at the time of her abduction, was long considered one of the safest districts in a volatile region inhabited by the Hazara ethnic group. But in 2018, the Taliban launched an assault on the area and nearly took control, before being pushed back. The insurgents have increasingly threatened the highways and main roads across Afghanistan, taxing commercial vehicles and searching buses for anyone suspected of working for the government. Mr. Rajabi said his sister would often travel home unannounced to reduce the risk of being detained. Her family found out she was taken by the Taliban only after five days had passed. Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, denied that the group was behind the execution. But local officials said the Taliban had been using Ms. Rajabi to pressure local leaders into resolving certain outstanding issues, possibly including taxes that the Taliban believe they are owed. “The Taliban were angry that despite repeated notices, the leaders hadn’t reported to them,” said Mohamad Ayub Bahonar, the district governor of Jaghori. Ms. Rajabi’s 70-year mother, Mariam Akbari, traveled to the Taliban-held area to beg for her daughter’s release. The Taliban told her she must bring 15 district leaders who they wanted to talk to — something that was out of her power, she said. “I went and begged, I lowered myself at their feet, so my sweet daughter could come back to me alive,” Ms. Akbari said. “They told me ‘You are old, we respect you, but don’t come again.’” Ms. Akbari had already lost one son, a police officer, to the war about ten years ago. One of her two remaining sons lives with her and has a heart condition, and the other has lived in Iran for years without much contact with the family. “I really loved my daughter,” she said. “She had joined the police out of poverty.

Protests Swell in Russia’s Far East in a Stark New Challenge to Putin,2020-07-25,By Anton Troianovski,"['KHABAROVSK, Russia — Watching the passing masses of protesters chanting “Freedom!” and “Putin resign!” while passing drivers honked, applauded and offered high-fives, a sidewalk vendor selling little cucumbers and plastic cups of forest raspberries said she would join in, too, if she did not have to work. “There will be a revolution,” the vendor, Irina Lukasheva, 56, predicted. “What did our grandfathers fight for? Not for poverty or for the oligarchs sitting over there in the Kremlin.” The protests in Khabarovsk, a city 4,000 miles east of Moscow, drew tens of thousands of people for a three-mile march through central streets for the third straight week on Saturday. Residents were rallying in support of a popular governor arrested and spirited to Moscow this month — but their remarkable outpouring of anger, which has little precedent in post-Soviet Russia, has emerged as stark testimony to the discontent that President Vladimir V. Putin faces across the country. Mr. Putin won a tightly scripted referendum less than four weeks ago that rewrote the Constitution to allow him to stay in office until 2036. But the vote, seen as fraudulent by critics and many analysts, provided little but a fig leaf for public disenchantment with corruption, stifled freedoms and stagnant incomes made worse by the pandemic. “When a person lives not knowing how things are supposed to be, he thinks things are good,” said Artyom Aksyonov, 31, who is in the transportation business and who was handing out water from the trunk of his car to protesters under the baking sun in Lenin Square, on the protest route. “But when you open your eyes to the truth, you realize things were not good. This was all an illusion.” Across Russia, fear of being detained by the police and the seeming hopelessness of effecting change has largely kept people off the streets. Many Russians also say that whatever Mr. Putin’s faults, the alternative could be worse or lead to greater chaos. For the most part, anti-Kremlin protests have been limited to a few thousand people in Moscow and other big cities, where the authorities usually crack down harshly. Partly as a result, Mr. Putin remains firmly in control. And independent polling shows he still enjoys a 60 percent approval rating, though the figure has been falling. But the events in Khabarovsk have shown that the well of discontent is such that minor events can ignite a firestorm. The weekend crowds have been so large that the police have not tried to control them — even though the protesters did not have a permit, let alone a clear leader or organizer. And with Russians switching en masse from television, which is controlled by the government, to the largely uncensored internet to get their news, the state can easily lose its grip on the narrative. Khabarovsk, a city of 600,000 close to the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Chinese border, had not seen any protests of much significance since the early 1990s. That changed after July 9, when a SWAT team dragged the governor, Sergei I. Furgal, out of his car and whisked him to Moscow on 15-year-old murder accusations. Khabarovsk social media forums erupted in indignation over an arrest that looked like a Kremlin move to eliminate a young and well-liked politician who had upset an ally of Mr. Putin in the regional election in 2018. Tens of thousands spontaneously poured into the streets on July 11 as residents called for protests online, and they re-emerged in greater numbers on July 18. Smaller-scale marches through the city continued daily. Russian journalists who have been following the protests since the beginning said Saturday’s crowds were the biggest yet. Opposition activists estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 had turned out. City officials said that about 6,500 people had attended, clearly an undercount. As they have on previous weekends, the protesters gathered in the central Lenin Square by the headquarters of the regional government. They marched down a main street, blocking traffic, and made a three-mile loop through the city center before returning to the square. Police officers walked along casually on the sidewalk, without interfering. The crowd, some of whom wore face masks stenciled with Mr. Furgal’s name, looked like a cross section of the city, including working-class and middle-class residents, pensioners and young people. The most concrete demand in their chants was that Mr. Furgal face trial in Khabarovsk rather than in Moscow, but they did not shy away from challenging Mr. Putin directly. They shouted “Shame on the Kremlin!”, “Russia, wake up!” and “We are the ones in power!” Mr. Putin last Monday appointed a 39-year-old politician from outside the region, Mikhail V. Degtyarev, as the acting governor of the Khabarovsk region, angering residents further. Asked whether he would meet with the protesters, Mr. Degtyarev told reporters that he had better things to do than talk to people “screaming outside the windows.” The Kremlin appears determined to wait the protests out. The regional authorities have warned that they could worsen the spread of the pandemic, announcing on Saturday a sharp rise in coronavirus infections and noting that medical equipment and personnel had arrived from Moscow to aid local hospitals. One of the protesters, Vadim Serzhantov, a 35-year-old railway company employee, said he had held little interest in politics until recently. The arrest of Mr. Furgal, whom residents praise for populist moves such as cutting back on officials’ perks, was a turning point, Mr. Serzhantov said. “To be honest, I used to not care at all,” Mr. Serzhantov said. “But this is lawlessness.”']","Demonstrations in the city of Khabarovsk drew tens of thousands for the third straight weekend.

"Cold Comfort: France to Ban Heated Terraces, but Not This Winter",2020-07-28,By Constant Méheut,"['PARIS — France will ban heaters used by cafes and restaurants on outdoor terraces as part of a package of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption, the French ecology minister said on Monday. The French government’s announcement came at a difficult time for cafe and restaurant owners hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, with many largely relying on outdoor dining to comply with social distancing rules. In an attempt to give businesses time to continue in their recovery and adapt to the new law, the ban will not go into effect this winter, when many experts expect a resurgence of the virus. In a country famous for its terrace culture, heat lamps running on electricity or gas have flooded outdoor terraces for over a decade, making sitting outside in cold weather not only possible but comfortable. In Paris alone, some 70 percent of cafe terraces are estimated to have heating devices. Now, though, France is looking to accelerate its fight against climate change, and energy hungry heaters are increasingly seen as anachronistic. Several cities in France banned outdoor heaters in recent months and calls to follow suit in Paris gained traction in the run-up to the municipal elections in March. “It’s about ending practices that are ecological aberrations and that lead to totally unjustified energy consumption,” France’s new ecology minister, Barbara Pompili, said after meeting with President Emmanuel Macron’s environmental defense council on Monday. “It is not possible to heat terraces at full capacity in the depths of winter when it is zero degrees for the sheer pleasure of drinking your coffee on a terrace while being warm,” she added. Even before the pandemic, the country’s cafes and restaurants were suffering a drop in business because of monthlong strikes that kept many people off the street. Then they were forced to shut their doors for 11 weeks as the nation locked down to slow the spread of the virus. “Restaurant owners were already down on their knees,” said Marcel Benezet, a representative of the GNI-HCR, the country’s main union for cafes, hotels and restaurants. “Now, with this ban, the government is giving us a second sledgehammer blow.” Mr. Benezet said that as the reopening of cafes and restaurants came with new health restrictions limiting attendance in enclosed areas, outdoor terraces had become the only place where “you can make a little money.” Many cities across France have allowed cafes and restaurants to extend their outdoor terraces into areas normally reserved for pedestrians in order to compensate for the loss of income resulting from social distancing rules imposed on these businesses. In Paris, with some 17,000 cafe terraces, dozens of cobblestone streets are now buzzing with customers sometimes sitting right in the middle of the street, as they enjoy their apéros, a pre-dinner drinking tradition that the pandemic had all but extinguished. Despite the government delaying the ban until next spring, Mr. Benezet said that since no one knew how long the epidemic would last, it could come into force at a time when outdoor seating is still needed to mitigate the economic effects of social distancing rules. France, like other European countries, is facing a slow but worrisome resurgence of the epidemic. There were about 800 new cases a day on average over the last two weeks, compared to 500 a day the previous week, with authorities reporting about 100 active clusters of the virus, which officials fear could foster a second wave of infections nationally. “We need more time to adapt ourselves,” Mr. Benezet said. “We should not be sacrificed in the name of ecology.” The ban is part of a series of environmental measures to be introduced in the coming months, such as encouraging building owners to improve insulation and prohibiting them from installing coal or fuel oil furnaces in new homes. Some measures, including the ban on heated terraces, are a direct result of proposals from a Citizen’s Convention on Climate that Mr. Macron set up after the Yellow Vest protests in 2019, in a bid to balance economic policies with long-term environmental objectives. In late June, just after the Green party won a landslide victory in the municipal elections that has put the French government to the test, Mr. Macron pledged €15 billion, or about $18 billion, to pay for environmental proposals.']",The ban is part of a series of environmental measures meant to curb energy consumption and push the nation toward a greener economy.
"Of Wine, Hand Sanitizer and Heartbreak",2020-07-27,By Adam Nossiter,"['HUNAWIHR, France — The tanker-truck pulled up and it was time to let it go. The decision to send the wine to the distillery had been made weeks ago. It still hurt. Soon the wine would be sanitizing hand gel. “We’ve got to load it up now,” said Jérôme Mader, a 38-year-old winemaker, muttering to himself. “OK, I am not even going to think about it anymore,” he said quietly. “It’s over.” Head down, he dragged the hoses out through his shed, affixed them to the truck’s valves with the help of the driver, walked up to his cool cellar, and turned on the pumps. The wine — good Alsace white wine, drinkable wine — coursed through the hoses and into the truck’s belly. Its fate didn’t bear thinking about. Across the emerald Alsace wine country, now carpeted in deep-green vines — and across France’s other wine regions as well — thousands of winemakers, famous and obscure, are facing similar moments of heartbreak. The economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus, combined with the Trump administration’s 25 percent tax on French wines in the trade war dispute with Europe, has collapsed the wine market. Mr. Mader, whose high-quality Rieslings and Gewürztraminers are sent to fancy restaurants and shops on both sides of the Atlantic, has lost half his sales since December. “Covid is a catastrophe for us,” he said. And so some of the succulent and subtle white wine for which this region is famous, nurtured on the stony, sunbathed Alsace slopes, will wind up as hand sanitizer. Like other winemakers, Mr. Mader has no room in his cellar to stock unsold wine. “We can’t keep stocking what we haven’t sold,” he said. The precocious 2020 harvest, blessed by abundant sunshine, is barely a month away. The wine vats must be emptied for the new production. The distillery, for modest compensation, is the only option. The driver from the distillery had been making the rounds of winemakers all morning. “Some of them are taking this quite badly, because this wine has commercial value,” the driver, Lucas Neret, noted dryly. “We’re producing more than we can sell,” said Thibaut Specht, a winemaker in nearby Mittelwihr. “We have no choice.” Marion Borès’s family business, Domaine Borès, in Reichsfeld, is sending 30 percent of its production — 19,000 liters. “It’s like you are saying goodbye to somebody who is very dear to you,” she said. “This is not exactly the destination we had in mind, when we made this wine,” the 27-year-old winemaker added. The old wine is ending up in the towering steel silos of the nearby Romann distillery, where it will be boiled down to alcohol. In Alsace alone, over six million liters of wine, or about 1.5 million gallons, will end up like this. Mr. Mader is sending 15 percent of his production, wine he calls “Edelzwicker,” or “noble blend” in Alsatian dialect. Usually sold wholesale, “it’s still pretty good,” Mr. Mader said. At the distillery, the odor of boiled-down wine, like the essence of a rich beef burgundy sauce, hung heavy over the establishment on a warm morning this week. “We’re continuously distilling,” said Erwin Brouard, the company’s director. “It’s something that’s very sad for the winemakers. Their stocks are too big. They’ve got to make space. And the harvest is early this year.” The French government, anxious to protect its precious wine heritage, is subsidizing the operation, compensating the some 5,000 winemakers who have signed up so far at a fraction of the wine’s value, less than $1 per liter, in what the government calls Crisis Distillation. “My cellar is bursting, ”said Guillaume Klauss, who owns a nearby winery. “If I don’t send it off, I don’t eat. Clearly this is tearing me up. It’s three years of work, and we’re not even paid properly.” Alsace is having to resort to Crisis Distillation for the first time in its history although it is not unknown in other wine regions. The last time this happened was in 2009, after the financial collapse. “A very big majority have been battered by this crisis,” said Francis Backert, head of the Independent Winemakers Association of Alsace. “These people are really hurting.” he said. “All the outlets are blocked,” he added. “Export is blocked. Trump, Covid. There’s very little going on outside France. The American market, blocked.” Wholesale wine traders are facing losses of 70 percent, he said. But the monetary losses are one thing. There is also the psychological blow. “Look, these people have a great deal of circumspection, and shame,” Mr. Backert said. “They just don’t want to talk about it. Obviously, this is breaking their heart.” Some winemakers in the region refused to be interviewed on the subject. The relationship to their vines, and what is produced from them, is personal as much as financial. Many live in modest houses, carrying on a family trade that often goes back centuries. The date carved above the original Borès cellar is 1723. On the sun-battered schist and sandstone slopes above Reichsfeld, Ms. Borès patrolled vines she has worked in since the age of 10, plucking out dead leaves and pulling shriveled grapes. Her touch was light. “These are vines that we fuss over the whole year round,” said her mother, Marie-Claire. “We do everything by hand. And now, this. Terrible.” Climbing the steep slope, Marion said, “We played in these vines,” adding that she takes part in the harvest herself. “The schist is magical,” she said. “It is what makes the wine dynamic. There are moments when you are really glad to be alone in these vines.” In his career, Mr. Mader has won prizes, and has faced the opposite problem he has today — not having enough wine to satisfy demand. “To have imagined, a few years ago, that a truck would be passing by one day … it’s unimaginable,” he said, his voice trailing off. For days he put off making a decision about the distillery. “I hesitated,” he said. “I thought we would get over it. I waited until the last day to decide. I always think the next day will be better.” But the decision couldn’t be postponed; the government was pressing with its sign-up deadline. Afterward, to console himself and colleagues, he said, “I called up a friend and we drank a couple of bottles.” “As long as the wine is good, there is always hope,” he added. Orders have recently picked up, a little. Besides, “the grapes this year are truly magnificent,” he said.']","Between the coronavirus and the Trump tariffs, the French wine market has collapsed. So winemakers are — sadly — sending their excess product off to another life as hand sanitizer."
Israel Says It Thwarted a Hezbollah Raid at Lebanon Border,2020-07-27,By Isabel Kershner,"['JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Monday that it had thwarted a raid by a Hezbollah “terrorist squad” in a disputed area along its northern border with Lebanon, resulting in an exchange of fire that capped days of mounting tension there. An Israeli military spokesman said that a small squad armed with assault rifles had crossed an unfenced section of the boundary into Israel by a few yards. Israeli forces responded, firing small arms, tank guns and then artillery, the spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said. The squad fled back into Lebanon, he said, and then fired back at Israel. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization, denied that there had been an exchange of fire, saying the only firing had come from the Israeli side. “Everything that the enemy’s media is claiming in terms of foiling an infiltration operation” is “absolutely not true,” Hezbollah said in a statement. “It is an attempt to invent false and mythical victories.” No casualties were reported by either side. Israel had been bracing for retaliation from Hezbollah since the killing of one of its operatives in a strike in Syria last week that was attributed to Israel. Hezbollah said Monday that retaliation was still coming, as well as retaliation for the shelling on Monday. Lebanese television reported shelling near the Lebanese village of Kafr Shuba. “The Zionists only need to continue waiting for the punishment for their crimes,” the Hezbollah statement said. On Monday afternoon, amid preliminary reports of explosions, smoke and cross-border fire, the Israeli military instructed residents of northern Israel to remain indoors and closed roads in the area. But the restrictions were lifted less than two hours later, a sign that calm had been restored and an apparent indication that Israel did not intend to prolong the confrontation. The events took place in the vicinity of Shebaa Farms — known in Israel as Mount Dov — a strip claimed by Israel, Lebanon and sometimes Syria near the intersection of all three nations and adjacent to the Golan Heights. Israel’s defense minister, Benny Gantz, had visited the northern border on Sunday as anticipation of a retaliatory attack by Hezbollah grew. Syria’s state-run news agency, SANA, reported that Israeli aircraft had fired rockets toward southern Damascus last Monday night, July 20. Though Israel rarely takes responsibility publicly for specific strikes, it has acknowledged carrying out scores of attacks aimed, it says, at preventing the transfer of sophisticated weapons from Iran to Hezbollah via Syria. After last week’s strike on an ammunition depot near the Damascus airport, Hezbollah said that one of its operatives, Ali Kamel Mohsen, was killed in an act of “Zionist aggression.” The killing appeared to violate informal rules of engagement between Israel and Hezbollah. In recent years, Hezbollah has refrained from killing Israelis while Israel has largely avoided killing Hezbollah fighters in Syria. Both sides want to press their points while avoiding a war that could devastate Lebanon and Israel. In a television interview on Sunday, Naim Qassem, the deputy secretary general of Hezbollah, described the Hezbollah fighter killed in Syria as a martyr and said the group would uphold the rules of engagement. “The deterrence equation with Israel is standing,” he said on the Arabic news channel Al Mayadeen. “Amending or changing the rules of engagement or the deterrence equation are not on our agenda.” Israel contends that Hezbollah, with Iran’s help, is trying to build a fleet of precision-guided missiles, which Israel considers a red line. Last August, an Israeli drone struck a building near Beirut that Israeli officials said contained machinery for making those missiles. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that officials were closely monitoring the situation in the north. “Hezbollah needs to know that it’s playing with fire,” he said. “Every attack against us will be answered with great might.” He said that Israel “will not allow Iran to entrench itself militarily on our border with Syria” and warned that “Lebanon and Hezbollah will bear responsibility for any attack” originating from Lebanese territory. Israel and Hezbollah fought a devastating, monthlong war in 2006. There have only been sporadic clashes across the Israel-Lebanon border in recent years. Monday’s events came as many Israelis, largely barred from traveling abroad because of a spike in coronavirus infections, were vacationing in the north. Adam Rasgon contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Vivian Yee from Beirut.']",The Israeli military says it repelled a raid by Hezbollah in a disputed area along its northern border.

"Palestinians, Slammed for Suppressing Dissent, Free Protest Organizers",2020-07-28,By Adam Rasgon and Mohammed Najib,"['TEL AVIV — A court in the West Bank on Tuesday ordered the Palestinian Authority to release on bail 12 activists detained over the past 10 days for trying to stage an anti-corruption demonstration, arrests that had prompted sharp criticism that officials were using the pandemic to crack down on dissent. Palestinian authorities have charged the activists with violating emergency coronavirus regulations forbidding mass gatherings, among other infractions, according to one of their lawyers. Their trial is scheduled to begin on Aug. 17. “It’s very clear that the authority used the coronavirus restrictions as a pretext to arrest people who criticize it,” Muhannad Karaja, one of the activists’ lawyers, said in an interview. “They were detained because of their activism.” The activists had wanted to stage a protest in Manara Square in Ramallah on July 19, with the slogan “Fed Up,” but Palestinian security forces barred the rally and blocked off the area. The security forces began detaining the organizers that day and continued making arrests over several days, Mr. Karaja said. The activists, many of whom had been active on social media before their arrest, had criticized the Palestinian Authority for a poor response to the pandemic, nepotism and insider dealing. For example, many lashed out at the Palestinian Authority after relatives of senior officials in the governing Fatah party were promoted in the Health Ministry. The Palestinian Authority attorney general’s office declined to comment on the arrests. Security officials said the organizers had been told the demonstration could not go on as planned given health restrictions, but the activists had tried to proceed anyway. The number of coronavirus cases has jumped in the West Bank over the past month, growing more than fivefold. More than 10,000 cases have been confirmed in the West Bank and Gaza together, with more than 1,700 reported in the past seven days. Before their release on Tuesday, the activists pledged not to call for demonstrations as long as the virus proliferates in the West Bank and to report corruption allegations to authorities before publicizing them on social media, lawyers said. Palestinian officials have bridled at some of the activists’ allegations, calling them unfounded. Bail for some was set at $705, while for others it was put at $1,410. Most of the charges are subject only to fines, but some of the activists were also charged under a decades-old law barring unauthorized mass gatherings, which is subject to up to a year in prison. Ammar Dweik, director of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights, said the detentions appeared to be “somewhat arbitrary and politically motivated.” “The P.A. should be more tolerant and accepting of criticism, whether it is true or not,” Mr. Dweik said. “It should respond to criticism by issuing denials or explanations, not by detaining the critics.” Corruption is a top issue for Palestinians. More than 80 percent of Palestinians say they believe the authority’s institutions are tainted by corruption, according to a poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in June. And more than a quarter said they thought corruption was the most serious problem facing Palestinian society, according to the survey. Islam Fayez, the wife of one of the activists, said her husband would continue to speak out against corruption. “How can we confront Israel while we have corruption?” asked Ms. Fayez, 31. “We must clean up our own house before facing our adversary.” Adam Rasgon reported from Tel-Aviv, and Mohammed Najib from Ramallah.']","The activists, charged with violating coronavirus regulations forbidding mass gatherings, were released on bail after being held for a week."
"Taliban Announce Brief Cease-Fire, as Afghan Peace Talks Look Imminent",2020-07-28,By Mujib Mashal,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban said on Tuesday that they would observe a three-day cease-fire this week during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha, as Afghanistan’s president suggested the long-delayed talks between his government and the insurgents over ending the war could start in a week. The developments promise to inject new optimism into a peace process that was floundering with disagreements over a prisoner swap and increased insurgent attacks, even as the United States continues to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. In a statement, the Taliban said they had ordered the group’s fighters “not to carry out any kind of attacks against the enemy” during the three days and nights of the Muslim festival, and to “retaliate strongly” only if attacked. Afghan officials greeted the announcement with a note of caution. “The Afghan government welcomes the announcement of a cease-fire by the Taliban in Eid days, but the Afghan people wanted a lasting cease-fire,” said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani. “The Afghan government has taken all necessary steps to show its commitment for the peace process and calls on the Taliban to show commitment too. The Afghan people are tired of war and it must end.” The Taliban announcement came soon after Mr. Ghani said a prisoner swap that had faced opposition from his government would be completed and that direct negotiations with the Taliban would start in a week. Under a deal signed between the United States and the Taliban in February, which initiated the phased withdrawal of American troops, direct peace negotiations between the Afghan sides were conditioned on swapping 5,000 Taliban prisoners with 1,000 Afghan security forces held by the insurgents. The Afghan government, left out of those talks, had vehemently opposed any agreement made on its behalf for such a measure. But with the Trump administration increasing pressure and the drawdown of U.S. forces, the Afghan government found little choice but to cooperate with the prisoner swap. After releasing nearly 4,500 Taliban prisoners, the Afghan government said it could not release the rest since they had been accused of major crimes, including terror attacks, rape, and smuggling, according to Afghan officials. As a compromise, the government offered to provide the Taliban with the names of roughly 500 other prisoners it could release, which the insurgents rejected. A senior Afghan official aware of the developments said the government was compromising by releasing 5,000 prisoners, but hoped that the United States might still be able to convince the Taliban to change its mind on releasing 200 of the prisoners accused of the worst crimes. In the deal the United States signed with the Taliban in February, the prisoner swap was expected to be completed in 10 days, paving the way for direct negotiations between government and the Taliban. But as the disagreements over the prisoner swap continued, the Taliban intensified their attacks against an Afghan force that has seen its support from the U.S. military drastically reduced under Washington’s deal with the insurgents. Speaking at an event in Kabul on Tuesday, Mr. Ghani said 3,560 Afghan forces had been killed and nearly 6,800 others wounded since the February deal between the United States and the Taliban. And 775 civilians had been killed and 1,609 others wounded in the same period. “The window of opportunity is narrowing, as Afghan women and men are seeing the continuation of carnage instead of a peace dividend,” Mr. Ghani said.']",The developments could inject new optimism into a peace process that had been floundering over disagreements and insurgent attacks.
South Korea Confirms a Defector Swam Back to the North,2020-07-27,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The authorities in South Korea confirmed on Monday that a 24-year-old man who had defected from North Korea in 2017 had secretly returned to the North, crossing one of the world’s most heavily fortified borders during a pandemic and possibly bringing the coronavirus with him. On Sunday, North Korea claimed that a man had crossed into the country from the South, and that he was likely infected with the virus. South Korean officials went in search of any defectors who had gone missing, and by Monday they had zeroed in on the 24-year-old man, identified only by his family name, Kim. In 2017, he swam across the western inter-Korea border, which traces a path through a narrow sea strait, to defect to South Korea. On July 19, he swam back across the border into Kaesong, a city in the North, after crawling through a drain under barbed-wire fences, his family said. It was not immediately clear why the defector had returned to the North. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the man had been wanted by the South Korean police for questioning after a fellow North Korean defector accused him of raping her last month. North Korea said on Sunday that the man was “suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus,” \u200badding that he could be the country’s first virus case. The reverse defection prompted the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to order a total lockdown of Kaesong, a city of 300,000 people \u200bon the border with South Korea, and to declare a “maximum” national emergency. Until Sunday, North Korea had \u200brepeatedly \u200bsaid that it had no Covid-19 cases. The claim was questioned by outside experts given that the country shares a long land border with China, where the virus erupted late last year. The North also lacks equipment and medicine to fight an epidemic. But South Korean officials could not say whether the man might have \u200bcarried the coronavirus across the border. He had never been tested for the virus, Yoon Tae-ho, a senior official at the South’s national disease-control headquarters, said on Monday, and he was not known to have been in contact with a coronavirus patient. \u200bThe South Korean health authorities have tracked down two people who had frequent contact with the defector while he was in the South, and both tested negative, he said. South Korea’s military said on Monday that its investigators had found a bag belonging to the defector abandoned on Ganghwa Island, west of Seoul. They also found signs that he had crawled through a drain beneath the border’s barbed-wire fences. “We spotted the specific location from which he crossed over to the North on Ganghwa Island,” said Col. Kim Jun-rak, a spokesman for the South Korean military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a briefing on Monday. The defector’s current location is not known. South Korean officials said he was a native of Kaesong and was apparently familiar with the terrain around the western front line, where the Han River divides North and South Korea before emptying into the Yellow Sea. At some spots, the two sides are separated by over a mile of water. He apparently swam across the same general area where he had originally defected. \u200bAt least four other North Koreans have swum across the western river border to the South since 2012\u200b. The vast majority of the 33,000 North Koreans who have fled to the South since the early 1990s have gone through China. But some, like Mr. Kim, have crossed the inter-Korean border, which, in addition to being fortified by layers of tall, barbed-wire fences, is guarded by armed sentries and minefields.']",North Korea has accused him of bringing Covid-19 across the border.

"For Senegal’s Biggest Holiday, a Shortage of the All-Important Sheep",2020-07-29,By Ruth Maclean,"['MISSIRAH, Senegal — The couscous was all ready for the lunchtime crowd in Yassin Dicko’s restaurant near one of the biggest sheep markets in Senegal. But except for family members, the place was empty. Ms. Dicko’s usual customers, shepherds from Mauritania, had not shown up. She looked outside to the vast holding area where just a few meager herds of sheep trotted around, their bleating oddly human. While the corrals in Missirah, in central Senegal, are usually packed with sheep at this time of year, hardly any salesmen had shown up. Almost no buyers either. “This is a real crisis,” she said. It was 13 days before Tabaski, the Senegalese version of Eid al-Adha, the biggest religious celebration of the year in the country, which is about 95 percent Muslim. No sheep for the Tabaski feast for a Muslim Senegalese family is like no presents at Christmas for a Christian one, and in the two weeks before the holiday, which takes place this year on July 31, there is usually a shopping rush for the animals. But monthslong government-imposed measures to contain the coronavirus — borders closed, markets shuttered and travel severely restricted — have been financially devastating for many people in Senegal, putting a purchase of great cultural and social importance beyond the reach of many this year. Even in ordinary years, the sheep is a major purchase for many families, who take out high-interest loans to pay for it and the other food and new clothes that are typically an obligatory part of the celebration. Owners guard their sheep purchases closely, sometimes even sleeping in the same room with the animal, to avoid falling victim to a theft. While most families buy their sheep in the month before Tabaski, some buy them a year or more in advance and do the fattening up themselves. This year, aware that citizens would be worried about catching the virus at in-person markets, the livestock ministry set up a Tinder-like digital matchmaking site, where sellers could post appealing photos of their sheep. Buyers were able to swipe left or right through hundreds of sheep profiles on Sama Xaru Tabaski — or “My Tabaski Sheep” in Wolof, the most widely spoken of Senegal’s many languages — and then arrange a deal for the animal that catches their fancy, skipping hours of risky face-to-face haggling. But the service has received meager traffic so far, and even if a would-be buyer can find a sheep, it may not be affordable. A $140 sheep last year now costs over $170, with the hike attributable, according to industry players, to the ripple effects of the coronavirus restrictions. Around half of Senegal’s Tabaski sheep come from neighboring Mali and Mauritania, and until late June, all the herds were completely stuck on the other side of the border, except those smuggled across. Now sheep are welcome, but even though the bovid border has been reopened, the expected surge of sheep has not materialized. One reason is that sheep now must be transported only in trucks, and many drivers are charging twice as much as usual to move the animals. On a recent Saturday, shepherds, swinging their sticks, yipped and whooped their skinny charges into the back of a truck in Kidira, a town in Senegal on the border with Mali where the sheep had been let out to graze. They were traveling to Dakar with the animals, riding in hammocks strung from truck beams above their undulant flocks. Watching the shepherds and their charges scurry aboard was Alassane Ndongo, president of the local herders’ association. While three shepherds can ride in each truck, Mr. Ndongo said that owners don’t because they generally travel alongside by car, and cars are banned from crossing the border. So many owners were simply keeping their flocks home, another reason for the shortages. In addition, Mr. Ndongo added, in typical years, many herds would cross the border on foot. But that requires setting off months in advance, and in 2020, that start date for the journey was just when governments were ordering everyone indoors. While the restrictions imposed to combat the coronavirus have been financially devastating for many, Senegal has not been as hard hit as many countries by Covid-19. Fewer than 10,000 people have had it, of whom 194 have died, according to official figures. In Dakar, Senegal’s capital, where the streets every year run red with sheep’s blood on Tabaski morning, Abou Gallo Thiello Kane runs the swankiest sheep mall in town, a spacious, manicured tent full of magnificent beasts. A famous mbalax dancer and comedian as well as sheep merchant to the stars — local celebrities and government ministers are said to be among his clients — Mr. Kane’s 20 years in the business have taught him what prospective buyers look for. “Women usually want a fat sheep, and a young one, because they’re thinking about how it will taste,” he said from behind a mask, as assistants hauled mangers up and down his ovine kingdom. “Men, on the other hand, buy for aesthetics, and for love.” Professional butchers are kept busy in Dakar for those who are too squeamish to slit the animal’s throat themselves or for those who have grown too close to their woolly companion. “Sheep for us are like dogs for Europeans,” said Mr. Kane, who is also president of the National Federation of Sheep Industry Actors. “They’re good company. They’re useful, and they’re friendly.” The sheep’s role in the Tabaski celebration is far more central than just providing a meal. Eid al-Adha honors the story of Ibrahim, whom God asked to sacrifice his cherished son, Ismail, but then told him at the last minute he could swap in a ram. “God did not tell Ibrahim to kill the sheep, or to eat it,” Mr. Kane said. “He said it should be a sacrifice. So you have to choose the sheep you love.” Most of Mr. Kane’s sheep are less lovable than imposing: They are Ladoums, an enormous and majestic crossbreed much prized by the Senegalese, for whom the mere mention of a Ladoum can elicit a wistful sigh. Mr. Kane’s best Ladoums sell for up to $3,500, and as I spoke with their owner, the regal creatures seemed to know it. One tossed his long tail; another stamped groomed hooves in freshly sprinkled sand. A third, his ears poking through striped, curling horns, looked up with a snooty expression as we walked past. They needn’t be so conceited. This year, even elite buyers are thin on the ground, Mr. Kane said. The reduced incomes brought by the pandemic shutdown has pushed some Senegalese from comfortable to struggling. Ms. Dicko, the restaurant owner, said she was worrying about her friends and neighbors, those who used to make $9 a day and now could only make $4. For them, she said, a sheep was out of the question, and tough days were ahead. “There will be a lot of hardship,” she said.

Egypt Sentences Women to 2 Years in Prison for TikTok Videos,2020-07-28,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — Armed with vaguely worded laws, Egypt’s guardians of conservative morals have long focused on belly dancers and pop stars in their efforts to police women’s behavior. Now they have hit upon a new target — young women who have become famous on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. In the latest episode of a long-running culture war, an Egyptian court on Monday convicted two women, social media stars, on charges of “violating family values,” and sentenced each of them to two years imprisonment. The court also found three men guilty on charges of helping post the women’s videos, lawyers said, and received the same sentence. The convictions were the first verdicts from a series of at least nine arrests since April of young Egyptian women who are prominent on TikTok, a wildly popular app. A third woman is expected to be sentenced on Wednesday, when two more will go on trial on similar charges. Social media is a highly contested and often perilous space in Egypt, where the government exerts tight controls over traditional media like newspapers and television, and has used courts to patrol digital platforms beyond its reach. Numerous Egyptians have been jailed for posts on Twitter and Facebook deemed critical of the government, or of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and at least five hundred news websites have been blocked. In some countries, TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese company, has come under intense scrutiny over concerns that the Chinese government could use it to spy on users. President Trump is considering steps to ban the app. But in Egypt, the focus is largely on the app’s potential impact on the country’s moral probity. Several women, mostly in their 20s, have become famous through their use of TikTok, in some cases earning thousands of dollars by monetizing their large followings. Some wear headscarves, a sign they come from conservative families. The backlash has come from Egypt’s Parliament as well as the courts, with some lawmakers demanding that government suspend Tiktok, accusing it of promoting nudity and immorality. Most of the women facing prosecution for their TikTok posts were put in jail without bail. Human rights activists launched a digital campaign last week to demand their release. The two women convicted on Monday — Haneen Hossam, 20, and Mawada el-Adham, 22 — gained millions of followers for lighthearted videos they posted to TikTok and other platforms that show them dancing, singing and clowning about. The clips are tame by social media standards, and nothing that would raise the eyebrow of a broadcast censor in the West. The women wept as a judge at the Cairo Economic Court handed down the sentences, one of their lawyers said. They were also fined nearly $19,000 each. Ms. Hossam, a second-year archaeology student at Cairo University, was arrested in April for a short Instagram video clip that prosecutors called “indecent.” In the video, she encouraged women to post videos of themselves to the app Likee, which pays users based on the number of views they receive. Egyptian prosecutors accused Ms. Hossam, who usually wears a headscarf in her videos, of inviting young women to sell sex online. Her lawyer, Ahmed Abdelnaby, denied the charge. “Nothing she said in that video violated the law,” he said. “The video is proof of her innocence, not the opposite.” Ms. el-Adham, a former beauty pageant contestant with 3.2 million followers on TikTok, was on the run for days before her arrest in May, moving between houses in the Cairo suburbs and Egypt’s Mediterranean coast. During the trial, prosecutors slammed videos that she posted as “disgraceful and insulting,” her lawyer said. Like many of the defendants, Ms. el-Adham, the daughter of a retired policeman, is from a solidly middle-class family. She moved to Cairo from the coastal town of Marsa Matruh four years ago to pursue her university studies, she said in a television interview in 2018. At the time, she worked in sales. In one of Ms. el-Adham’s last videos, before police tracked her down using her phone signal and internet usage, she posed smiling in a velour one-piece jumpsuit with her hair dyed blue. “They have destroyed us, they have destroyed an entire family,” her older sister, Rahma el-Adham, said in a tearful interview with a television station on Monday night. The two women who\xa0are scheduled to stand trial on Wednesday on similar charges are Nora Hisham and her mother, Sherifa Refaat, both of whom posted videos to TikTok. They were arrested on Jun. 11. Such prosecutions often start when activist lawyers, who present themselves as arbiters of public morality and protectors of Egyptian nationalism, file criminal cases accusing the women of offenses like “inciting debauchery” and “spreading fake news.” The cases are then taken to trial by zealous public prosecutors who enjoy sweeping powers under a cybercrimes law passed in 2018, which provides for prison sentences and heavy fines for digital content deemed to violate public morals. The criminalization of women for their TikTok videos stands in sharp contrast to the treatment of another group of Egyptian women who, earlier this month, were commended for their use of social media to highlight assault complaints, leading to an Egyptian #MeToo moment. A flood of sexual assault complaints posted to an Instagram page about Ahmed Bassam Zaki, a 21-year-old business student, prompted the authorities to arrest Mr. Zaki and start an investigation. Since then, the government has introduced draft legislation that aims to protect the privacy of sexual abuse victims. Egyptian activists say that social class partly accounts for the differing treatment of the two groups of women. While the TikTok women come from working- or middle-class backgrounds, Mr. Zaki’s accusers come from wealthier and powerful families that are less often the target of moral censure.

Migrants Adrift Off Malta Called for Help. Then They Waited. And Waited.,2020-07-27,By Gaia Pianigiani,"['The rubber dinghy packed tight with more that 95 people was bobbing helplessly in the Mediterranean on Sunday when the passengers issued a distress call, but help would not come anytime soon. In the end, it took more than 33 hours — and the pressure of activists and nongovernmental groups — before the Maltese authorities launched a rescue operation. All onboard were eventually brought to shore, but the incident, the latest of dozens like it in recent weeks, has raised questions about the risk to human life posed by policies intended to deter migrants from crossing the Mediterranean. The dinghy carrying the migrants, who were said to be from Eritrea, was one of dozens of vessels left adrift in the central Mediterranean in recent months, said Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. “The recurring delays that we are witnessing in rescuing people this year are unacceptable,” Mr. Di Giacomo said in a phone interview. “They put people’s lives at risk. These boats are unfit to sail; they can go down any time.” The migrants on the overcrowded dinghy Sunday contacted Alarm Phone, a watchdog group that often acts as first point of call for migrants adrift in the Mediterranean. The group says it alerted the authorities — but hours later, there was still no rescue in sight. “A merchant vessel is monitoring the situation but not providing assistance,” Alarm Phone wrote in a post on Twitter on Monday morning. “How long will the people be left suffering & at risk of drowning? How long can they survive?” Hours later, the International Organization for Migration echoed the concern. “Around 95 migrants are still floating in the Central Mediterranean at risk of drowning, after attempting to flee Libya,” it said. Not until Monday afternoon did the armed forces of Malta reportedly bring the group to shore. Activists have lamented the scarcity of independent rescue ships in the central Mediterranean, which has become a major crossing for migrants escaping war-torn Libya, and is one of the world’s most dangerous passages. Last week, Italy’s Coast Guard blocked the last ship operating for the migrant rescue organization SOS Mediterranée, citing administrative failures. In a statement, the organization said that the move was “aimed at impeding our lifesaving work,” and at discouraging other groups from doing the same. The Italian authorities also detained the vessel of another aid group, the Sea-Watch 3. These organizations have carried out the bulk of rescue operations in the Mediterranean in recent years since, particularly after Italy signed a memorandum of understanding with Libya in 2017 that effectively delegated most of the operations to the Libyan Coast Guard. In recent years, thousands of migrants have died while attempting the crossing. Two-hundred and seventy have drowned since January alone. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has made the situation still more complicated. Italy and Malta have both declared their ports not safe for migrants because of the public health threat. Malta, a tiny island nation, has been on the front line of the migration route for years. Its government has long been accused by migrant advocates of responding slowly — or not at all — to distress calls coming from their large search and rescue zone, and of allowing the Libyan Coast Guard to take back migrants who had already made it into their area of responsibility. Now, with the onset of the virus, Malta says it is too overwhelmed to do rescues. But it did secretly dispatch a fleet of private vessels in April to intercept migrants and return them by force to Libya, according to information provided by the captain of one of the boats, a senior commander in the Libyan Coast Guard, and a former Maltese official involved in the episode, who spoke to The New York Times earlier this year. That same month, 12 migrants died in a shipwreck that occurred after their rubber boat had been left adrift for days. The 51 survivors were returned to Tripoli. In Italy, processing procedures for migrants who arrive by boat have become lengthier because of the pandemic, and the government has been struggling to find places to quarantine migrants. Last week, Matteo Salvini, a far-right politician and former deputy prime minister, visited the island of Lampedusa, south of Sicily, where he drew on the mounting anger of the mayor. “This is not immigration, it’s chaos,” Mr. Salvini said in a video posted on his Facebook account. “It’s 800 people in a hot spot that can accommodate 90 people.” “They are on the roof, they are everywhere,” he said. Small wooden boats carrying migrants from Tunisia have landed on the shores of Lampedusa for years. But the number of migrant arrivals this year are far smaller than in the past. ']",A boat carrying 95 migrants on the Mediterranean floated adrift for more than 30 hours before the Maltese authorities finally brought them to shore under intense pressure.
"Poland Considers Leaving Treaty on Domestic Violence, Spurring Outcry",2020-07-27,By Marc Santora,"['The Polish government, emboldened by a narrow election victory this month and undeterred by criticism from European Union leaders, is considering withdrawing from a treaty aimed at curbing domestic violence and protecting women’s rights, with the country’s minister of justice filing paperwork on Monday to start the process. The move came just one week after European Union leaders, bowing to pressure from Poland and Hungary, relaxed demands that were supposed to tie funding in the bloc’s long-term budget to issues related to rule of law. In the days since, both Warsaw and Budapest have pressed ahead with agendas that critics say compromise judicial independence, media freedom and gay rights. Poland’s plan to pull out of the domestic abuse treaty is likely to face stiff resistance, however. The mere suggestion that the government wanted to withdraw prompted thousands of protesters to take to the streets over the weekend and led the Council of Europe, a human rights organization with 47 member countries, to express alarm at the prospect. The treaty, known as the Istanbul Convention, is intended to combat violence against women in Europe. Conceived more than a decade ago, the treaty has been caught up in a maelstrom of disinformation and populist rhetoric, cast as a threat to national sovereignty and twisted by conspiracy theories and smear campaigns. The convention has been targeted by far-right and nationalist leaders across East and Central Europe and has become a totem in the battle against what they portray as the too-liberal influences of Western culture. Although the treaty does not address issues of gay rights, opponents have claimed that the treaty promotes “L.G.B.T. ideology” and poses a threat to Christian morality. Ratification of the treaty has stalled in several European countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia and Slovakia. Russia, which is also a member of the Council of Europe, has not signed it. When a previous Polish government ratified the treaty in 2012, Zbigniew Ziobro, then a member of the opposition and now the Polish justice minister, called it “an invention, a feminist creation aimed at justifying gay ideology.” Although the government has insisted that no final decision has been made yet, Mr. Ziobro, a lawmaker from United Poland, the more conservative member of the governing coalition, organized a news conference on Monday to say that he had started the process of withdrawal. Mr. Ziobro also said he believed that Poland had “a higher level of protection of women than in the convention,” and he added that the treaty had “a second part, which concerns ideology and harms the interests of women and of family.” Mr. Ziobro’s increasing attacks on the treaty came just one week after the leaders of the 27 member nations of the European Union agreed to take on hundreds of billions of euros in common debt. To convince Poland and Hungary to back the deal, European leaders watered down language making funding conditional on the rule-of-law benchmarks. Returning from Brussels, where the budget negotiations had taken place, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland said his country had notched a success. “We are coming back as the great winner,” he said. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary struck a similarly triumphant note. His government has been solidifying control over the country’s news media in ways critics say undermine press freedom. Hungary signed onto the Istanbul Convention in 2014 but has never ratified the treaty. The most recent attempt to get legislative approval came at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in May and failed. David Vig, director of Amnesty International in Hungary, said then that the decision was “extremely dangerous coming at a time when reported domestic violence incidents in Hungary have doubled since the start of the COVID-19 lockdown.” The attack on the treaty in Poland has been folded into a broader culture war — a fight over values that led to the one of the closest presidential contests since the first partially free election was held in the former communist country in 1989. Strong rhetoric against gays and lesbians was at the heart of President Andrzej Duda’s campaign for re-election. He said “L.G.B.T. ideology” was more dangerous than communist doctrine. Mr. Duda narrowly won, in large part thanks to support from influential members of the Catholic clergy. But rather than trying to heal the rifts of the bitter campaign, the government has pressed ahead in its efforts to protect what it defines as “traditional values.” On Friday, thousands of women, some dressed as characters from “The Handmaid’s Tale,”  demonstrated outside the headquarters of a conservative Catholic group, Ordo Iuris, in Warsaw. Protesters held up the obituaries of Polish women killed by their partners and husbands. “This government has been laughing in the faces of victims of gender violence for years,” said Marta Lempart, one of the leaders of the Polish Women’s Strike, which previously organized nationwide protests of the government’s attempts to tighten what are already some of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws. Marija Pejcinovic Buric, secretary general of the Council of Europe, said in a statement on Sunday that Poland’s withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention “would be highly regrettable and a major step backwards in the protection of women against violence in Europe.” While it does not carry legal force in any country, the treaty’s signatories are expected to introduce laws which criminalize psychological and physical violence against women, including sexual violence, rape, stalking, forced marriage and forced abortion. The states that ratify the document also commit to prevent and prosecute crimes against women; introduce educational campaigns about the topic; and adhere to a monitoring procedure, assessing the implementation of the convention. In Slovakia, which has signed but not ratified, the treaty has been targeted by a wide range of groups on the right, including the neo-fascist Kotlebists — People’s Party Our Slovakia. During the prelude to national elections this year, hundreds of people gathered in the capital, Bratislava, for a “prayer” against the “evil from Istanbul.” In Bulgaria, the treaty has faced fierce backlash from across the political spectrum, with critics claiming that it would force the country to legalize same-sex marriages and what they refer to as the “third gender.” The Bulgarian Constitutional Court found in 2018 that the convention defined the term “gender” in a manner incompatible with Bulgarian law. The judges argued that by defining gender as a social construct, the treaty blurred the lines between the sexes. “If society loses its ability to distinguish between a woman and a man, combating violence against women would remain a formal yet futile commitment,” the court found. Advocates have condemned the political efforts to sabotage the treaty. “Simply put, the Istanbul Convention aims to prevent and combat violence against women,” said Radoslav Stoyanov, an expert with the legal program of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization based in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. “However,” he added, “the public debate somehow missed the core aims of the treaty.” In Poland, withdrawal from the treaty would probably have little practical impact because the government has not used it to advance much legislation that protects women. Last year, lawmakers proposed defining domestic violence as having taken place only when spouses had been beaten more than once, though that plan was abandoned after a fierce backlash. Domestic violence in Poland is widespread and underreported, according to the Warsaw-based Women’s Rights Center, an organization that works to prevent attacks against women. The center estimates that about 800,000 women in Poland are victims every year, with the 400 to 500 deaths reported each year from beatings, murder and suicide tied to domestic violence most likely understating the problem. Natalia Broniarczyk, an activist with the group Abortion Without Borders, said, “Politicians from the ruling party know that violence against women is an everyday reality in Poland,” adding, “What is the most cruel is the timing — they are coming back to the issue during a pandemic, when the situation of victims of violence has gotten much worse, as they were locked in with their abusers.” Reporting was contributed by Monika Pronczuk from Brussels; Anatol Magdziarz from Warsaw; Kit Gillet from Bucharest, Romania; Boryana Dzhambazova from Sofia, Bulgaria; and Miroslava German Sirotnikova from Bratislava, Slovakia.']","The European treaty was intended to protect women from abuse, but it has become a target for populist and nationalist leaders who claim it poses a threat to “traditional families.”"
Hong Kong University to Fire Law Professor Who Inspired Protests,2020-07-28,By Austin Ramzy and Tiffany May,"['HONG KONG — The University of Hong Kong’s governing body voted on Tuesday to fire an associate law professor who was convicted last year of charges related to his leading role in the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests and has remained a key figure in the city’s pro-democracy movement. The legal scholar, Benny Tai, was convicted of public nuisance charges last year and sentenced to 16 months in prison, but he was released and remains on bail while his case is under appeal. The university had faced widespread calls from members of the pro-Beijing establishment to dismiss Mr. Tai. But his supporters argued that dismissing him would undermine academic freedom that has already been imperiled by a new national security law imposed by Beijing. The decision “marks the end of academic freedom in Hong Kong,” Mr. Tai said in a Facebook post. “Academic staff in education institutions in Hong Kong are no longer free to make controversial statements to the general public about politically or socially controversial matters.” Last year the university began an investigation into Mr. Tai that led to Tuesday’s decision by the school’s council, a body dominated by members from outside the university. Arthur Li, its chair, is also an adviser to Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive. The university’s senate, which is comprised largely of academic staff, found earlier this month that Mr. Tai’s conduct did not warrant his removal. The council rejected that recommendation, a move that Mr. Tai’s supporters called politically motivated. “Arthur Li has completed his political mission, and Benny Tai has become a martyr to civil disobedience,” said Joseph Chan, a political science professor at the university. “The University of Hong Kong has sacrificed its reputation and it will not be able to hold its head high in the international academic community. This day will become a major stain in the history of the University of Hong Kong that cannot be washed away.” Lei Tsz Shing, an undergraduate representative of the university’s council, said in an opinion article on Tuesday that Mr. Tai’s termination would contradict messages that academic freedom would be maintained under the national security law. “If the university at this moment ignores the senate’s recommendations and fires Benny Tai, it would be equivalent to declaring that academic freedom is being repressed,” he wrote on Tuesday in The Stand News, an online outlet. The Hong Kong University Students’ Union had argued that Mr. Tai should not be dismissed, calling him a model scholar who was willing to put his knowledge into action. “He has impressed on generations of students the responsibility of a public intellectual, with his genuine care of society and unwavering pursuit of universal suffrage,” the group wrote in a statement on Facebook. Mr. Tai was a central figure in the 2014 Umbrella Movement, calling for a protest to push for more direct democracy in Hong Kong. What he had envisioned as a sit-in of a few days was pre-empted by student demonstrators who occupied a square near government headquarters. Thousands took to the streets after police used pepper spray and tear gas on the protesters. They occupied major roadways in the city for 79 days, but ultimately failed to change how Hong Kong chooses its leaders. He was convicted last year of conspiracy to commit public nuisance and incitement to commit public nuisance. The judge rejected the argument made on behalf of Mr. Tai and eight other defendants that the protests were an appropriate exercise of free speech. Shiu Ka-chun, a Legislative Council member who was one of the eight other activists convicted along with Mr. Tai last year, said he was told Monday that Hong Kong Baptist University was not renewing his contract to teach social work.  After his conviction, Mr. Tai has remained active in politics, and this year helped organize a primary vote among the pro-democracy camp to choose candidates for a legislative election in September. More than 600,000 people participated, despite government warnings the exercise might be illegal under the new national security law. The turnout was an early indication of broad support for the opposition camp. The primary was denounced both by Hong Kong government and Beijing’s representatives in the city, who singled out Mr. Tai for vehement criticism. “Facts have proven that Benny Tai and his like are the chief culprits for creating the chaotic situation in Hong Kong, bringing disaster to Hong Kong and harming its people,” Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said after the primary earlier this month. Elaine Yu contributed reporting.']",Benny Tai was convicted of public nuisance charges related to his leading role in the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement.
"Najib Razak, Malaysia’s Former Prime Minister, Found Guilty in Graft Trial",2020-07-28,By Richard C. Paddock,"['BANGKOK — For 45 years, Najib Razak was a master of Malaysia’s cutthroat politics. The son and nephew of prime ministers, he was elected to Parliament at 22 and rose to the country’s highest office. As prime minister he was all but untouchable — critics called him the “Man of Steal” — even as $4.5 billion disappeared from a government investment fund he controlled. On Tuesday, he was finally held to account. After years of allegations that he pilfered government coffers to lead a life of excess and luxury, he was found guilty on seven corruption counts and sentenced to up to 12 years in prison and fined nearly $50 million. The sentence was stayed pending appeal. The sweeping verdict was a stunning setback for Mr. Najib, whose political party had recently returned to power after forcing out the reformist government that won elections in 2018. His political foes applauded the verdict and praised the independence of the trial court. But experts said the verdict could be overturned on appeal in what is likely to be a yearslong process. The severity of the sentence came as a surprise to some, after the government recently cut a deal with Mr. Najib’s stepson that allowed him to keep millions of dollars that were believed to have been stolen from the same Malaysia Development Berhad fund. Tuesday’s trial was the first of five related to the theft of billions from the investment fund, commonly known as 1MDB, and Mr. Najib was found guilty on all seven charges of abuse of power, breach of trust and money laundering. The stolen money was traced by prosecutors to the purchases of a mega-yacht and a Picasso painting, as well as an investment in the Hollywood blockbuster “The Wolf of Wall Street.” About $1 billion of the money ended up in Mr. Najib’s personal bank accounts, creating the national scandal that led to the ouster of his party, the United Malays National Organization, in elections two year ago. The court rejected Mr. Najib’s defense that the theft was carried out without his knowledge by Jho Low, a wealthy Malaysian businessman who is accused of masterminding the crime and remains an international fugitive. “After considering all evidence in this trial, I find that the prosecution has successfully proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt,” said Judge Mohamad Nazlan Mohamad Ghazali of the Kuala Lumpur High Court. Mr. Najib faced seven charges of money laundering, criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving transfers of $9.8 million from SRC International, a former unit of the investment fund commonly known as 1MDB. Before the sentence was pronounced, Mr. Najib appealed to the judge for leniency, noting his contributions as a public official and that the country prospered during his nine years as prime minister. He said he did not solicit the $9.8 million payment nor was it offered to him. Mr. Najib, 67, still faces dozens of additional charges. Many of the charges against him carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Mr. Najib remains a member of Parliament, and his party, popularly known as UMNO, returned to power in February, improving the chances that he will not have to spend time behind bars. His conviction could undermine the credibility of the current government headed by his ally, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, which came to power without an election and holds a bare majority in Parliament. James Chin, a professor of Asian studies at the University of Tasmania and an expert on Malaysian politics, said the guilty verdict would likely eventually be overturned on appeal. “People should not be celebrating, because in the Malaysian context, many of the judgments in these political cases get reversed in the appeals court,” he said. “I expect Najib to appeal, and he will probably win the appeal. In the long term, I expect Najib to get away with it as long as UMNO is in power.” The sentence included 12 years for the abuse of power and 10 years for each of the other charges. In Malaysia, sentences run concurrently, so the maximum he would serve would be 12 years in prison. Mr. Najib will not lose his seat in Parliament, but he would be prohibited from running for re-election unless his convictions are overturned on appeal. The court rejected the defense contention that he was a victim of a scam and did not know that money from the government fund had been deposited in his personal account. The judge also rejected the argument that Mr. Najib received the money as a gift from a Saudi royal and that he was unaware of the balance in his own account. “It would be extraordinary that the accused as the then-prime minister and finance minister did not know it,” said Judge Nazlan, who presided over the 14-month trial. In rejecting Mr. Najib’s defense and questioning his credibility, the judge cast doubt on whether the former prime minister’s legal strategy can be effective in his upcoming trials, which will focus on much larger amounts of money that went missing from 1MDB. The opposition leader of Parliament, Anwar Ibrahim, applauded the verdict and said justice had been served. “For over a decade the 1MDB scandal has been a blight on our nation’s reputation and has been the source of much anguish for the Malaysian people,” he said. “Money which should have been utilized for development and assisting the poor was diverted to illicit gains benefiting a former prime minister and his friends.” Mr. Najib’s lead defense lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, characterized his client as a victim of his political foes and asked the court for a light sentence because of Mr. Najib’s lifetime in public service. He said Mr. Najib had spent only a tiny fraction of the stolen money on himself, with nearly half going for political purposes and another 14 percent to charity. After appearing in court, Mr. Najib told supporters gathered outside that he is optimistic he will prevail on appeal. “This is definitely not the end of the world, because there’s a process of appeal, and we hope that we would be successful there,” he said. “The effort will continue, and to my supporters, I hope they will continue to believe in me, believe in our struggle, and continue to be in positive and high spirits.” In May, prosecutors dropped money-laundering charges against Mr. Najib’s stepson, the Hollywood producer Riza Aziz, who was accused of receiving $248 million in government funds. The producer of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Mr. Riza was allowed to walk away with $83 million under the terms of the agreement with the new attorney general, Idrus Harun. Last week, the new government and Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9 billion settlement over the company’s role in the scandal. The previous government had sought more than $2.7 billion in fines and had charged more than a dozen executives with fraud. Under the settlement, criminal charges against the bank and the executives were dismissed. Mahathir Mohamad, 95, who was prime minister from 1981 to 2003, came out of retirement in May 2018 to defeat Mr. Najib and UMNO, the party that Mr. Mahathir once led. After the election, the authorities raided properties owned by Mr. Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansour, and seized more than $270 million in cash, jewelry, luxury handbags, tiaras and other valuables. Ms. Rosmah also faces corruption charges. Mr. Mahathir pledged to pursue justice against Mr. Najib and his cronies, but he lost support within his coalition and stepped down in February. In the months since, and against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Najib’s supporters have returned to power in what opponents have called a “coup” and a “backdoor government.” Mr. Muhyiddin, who formed a coalition with UMNO, was appointed prime minister without an election and has since refused the opposition’s demands for a vote of confidence in Parliament. Mr. Najib, whose father and uncle were both prime ministers, is part of Mr. Muhyiddin’s inner circle but does not hold a leadership post. In cementing control after its return to power, Mr. Muhyiddin’s government has sought to crack down on independent news media, including Al Jazeera, which broadcast a 25-minute documentary earlier this month showing a military-style crackdown on undocumented migrant workers over coronavirus fears. The authorities announced that they were investigating Al Jazeera for sedition, defamation and violating communications laws. The broadcaster said seven of its staff members have been questioned by the police.']","Mr. Najib was sentenced to up to 12 years in prison and faces fines of nearly $50 million on charges of abuse of power, breach of trust and money laundering."
U.N. Panel Takes Aim at Heavy-Handed Police Tactics at Protests,2020-07-29,By Nick Cumming-Bruce,"['GENEVA — Law-enforcement authorities are obligated to protect and facilitate peaceful demonstrations, an influential United Nations human rights panel said on Wednesday, challenging tactics the police have used against anti-racism protests in American cities and around the world. The international treaty governing civil and political rights requires states to allow peaceful demonstrations, not to block or disrupt them without a compelling reason, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said. Authorities should also seek to de-escalate situations that might lead to violence and to use only the minimum force necessary to disperse crowds. “A failure to respect and ensure the right of peaceful assembly is typically a marker of repression,” the panel said in its finding. The committee of 18 international law experts monitors compliance with the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, a cornerstone of human rights law signed by 173 countries, including the United States.  The panel’s comment, a product of more than two years of deliberations, sets out international guidelines that speak to issues central to America’s deepening discord over the Trump administration’s response to the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland and elsewhere. The protests in Portland and elsewhere swelled after the administration dispatched federal law enforcement officials to confront demonstrators over the objections of local officials.  The U.S. Attorney General, William P. Barr, defended the administration’s intervention during heated exchanges on Tuesday with the House Judiciary Committee, asserting that “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction.”  On Wednesday, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said the U.S. government had agreed to remove tactical teams that had been deployed to Portland, and that the state would provide extra security for the federal courthouse in the city. The panel’s findings are not legally binding. But the timing of the comments thrusts the U.N. into a divisive debate roiling the United States during the heat of a presidential campaign. The U.N. panel said that law enforcement authorities should facilitate demonstrations and restrict the use of force to control or disperse protesters. It said crowds should be dispersed “only in exceptional cases” and after the authorities have exhausted nonviolent means to de-escalate tensions. “It is a fundamental human right for individuals to join a peaceful assembly to express themselves, to celebrate, or to air grievances,” said Christof Heyns, a law professor at South Africa’s University of Pretoria and the panel member who drafted the document. “Together with other rights related to political freedom, it constitutes the very foundation of a democratic society.” The United States, while endorsing some of the committee’s guidance, said in a commentary that the panel’s observations were “beyond its competence and mandate and contrary to international law.” The panel said military or paramilitary forces should not be used to police gatherings except in extraordinary circumstances and that concealing the identity of the police, a practice followed by federal agents in unmarked vehicles in Portland, undercut accountability. It also took aim at the use of tear gas, which has been heavily used by law enforcement agencies in Portland and elsewhere. It said tear gas should only be used as a last resort, and that rubber bullets should only be fired in response to an imminent threat of death or serious injury. The committee also asserted the “particular importance” of journalists and human rights defenders in monitoring demonstrations, emphasizing they should not be harassed or their equipment confiscated or damaged. Even if violence erupted to a point that justified dispersing a crowd, it did not justify dispersing journalists. “All of these are lessons that the government of the United States should be taking very much to heart,” said Gerald Neuman, a professor of international law at Harvard University who served on the committee. Human rights experts said the panel’s findings put a critical spotlight on the actions of federal agents in Portland and other cities and reinforce concerns that the heavy-handed policing there falls far short of international standards. “There are serious questions as to whether the administration’s response in Portland is sufficiently de-escalatory, respectful of rights, discerning about differences between peaceful and violent protesters, restrained in the use of force and weapons,” said Harold Hongju Koh, a Yale Law School professor who served as the State Department’s legal adviser in the Obama administration. “Of special concern is whether the federal agents being deployed have appropriate training,” he added.']",The comments by the United Nations Human Rights Committee come as the Trump administration faces growing criticism for deploying federal agents to confront Black Lives Matter protesters.
Kyrgyzstan Rights Activist Azimzhan Askarov Dies at 69,2020-07-27,By The Associated Press,"['MOSCOW (AP) — Azimzhan Askarov, a human rights advocate in Kyrgyzstan who was serving a life term on charges of involvement in ethnic violence that were widely criticized as trumped-up, has died in a prison clinic. He was 69. The U.N. Human Rights Committee and leading international human rights organizations had repeatedly urged the Central Asian nation’s authorities to release Mr. Askarov, noting his deteriorating health. Kyrgyzstan’s state penitentiary service said Mr. Askarov died Saturday in a prison clinic, a day after he was hospitalized with pneumonia. It noted in a statement that Mr. Askarov was also suffering from a heart condition and other chronic illnesses. His lawyer, Valeryan Vakhitov, said Mr. Askarov had a bad cough and experienced breathing difficulty when they last met recently, the Interfax news agency reported. Mr. Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek rights activist, has been sentenced to life in prison for his alleged role in the deadly ethnic violence in southern Kyrgyzstan in 2010. Several days of clashes between ethnic Kyrgyz and minority Uzbeks in the southern cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad killed 470 people, nearly three-quarters of whom were ethnic Uzbeks. Thousands of houses were destroyed and some 400,000 fled their homes. International rights groups criticized Kyrgyz authorities for mostly targeting the Uzbek minority while investigating the ethnic violence and failing to ensure justice for its victims. Before his detention, Mr. Askarov had led a human rights organization in southern Kyrgyzstan focused on prison conditions and police treatment of detainees. He documented violence and looting during the June 2010 violence. In September 2010, Mr. Askarov was found guilty of participating in riots, inciting ethnic hatred and abetting the slaying of a police officer killed during the unrest. Human Rights Watch and other rights groups said Mr. Askarov’s detention and trial were marred by serious human rights violations, including credible allegations of torture. In 2016, the U.N. Human Rights Committee found that Mr. Askarov was arbitrarily detained, held in inhumane conditions, tortured and mistreated. It urged Kyrgyzstan to immediately release Mr. Askarov and quash his conviction. Mr. Askarov’s lawyers repeatedly appealed, but Kyrgyz courts upheld his conviction.']","The human rights advocate, who was serving a life sentence on charges related to 2010 ethnic violence widely criticized as trumped-up, died in a prison clinic."
Paris Beehives Trace Notre-Dame’s Toxic Fallout,2020-07-29,By Elian Peltier,"['The hundreds of tons of lead that burned in the April 2019 fire that nearly destroyed Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris created a dangerous dust that landed in parks, buildings and playgrounds, raising health alarms. Now, scientists say, some of that lead has found its way to a surprising place: honey produced by urban beehives. A study outlined this week in Environmental Science & Technology Letters found that honey samples collected northwest of the cathedral, downwind from the fire, contained nearly three times as much lead on average than did those from before the fire. As investigators continue to seek the origins of the fire that ravaged the 850-year-old cathedral, and scientists, architects and historians study the building’s fragile structure and the debris, other research has focused on the pollution caused by the 460 tons of lead that burned that night. The honey study, conducted by Kate Smith and Dominique Weis of the University of British Columbia, is one of the first to explore the relationship between pollution from the fire and its impact on residents through a product they can ingest directly. The honey’s lead concentration — an average of 2.3 nanograms per gram — fell within consumable standards, said Ms. Smith, a doctoral candidate in geological sciences and the lead author of the study. She said the higher lead levels matched the geographical distribution of the dust cloud that was carried across Paris from the fire. “The evidence is pretty strong that the fire caused the lead elevation observed in the honey,” Ms. Smith said. Urban beekeeping has increased sharply in cities like Paris over the past decade, and the city estimated recently that it has more than 1,000 hives. Bees have taken up residence on the roofs of the gilded Opera Garnier and prestigious restaurants, in the flower-rich Luxembourg Gardens, and at Notre-Dame, too, where 200,000 bees that lived on the roof survived the fire. The study on the Parisian hives drew from 36 honey samples that were collected in July 2019, several months after the fire. Samples from before the fire were used as a reference point. It found that honey collected downwind of Notre-Dame had lead levels three times those in samples collected elsewhere in central Paris not only before the fire, but also after. In one hive, the levels were nearly nine times normal. Ms. Smith said that while the levels measured in the honey were safe, Parisians were right to have been worried about alarming lead concentrations in the aftermath of the fire. “Lead is recognized for its toxicity,” Ms. Smith said. “The health risk doesn’t diminish simply because the lead was not deposited recently.” Ms. Smith’s research focuses on how bees can act as sensitive pollution detectors. When bees forage for pollen or nectar, they pick up tiny particles of lead and other metals, and the honey they produce provides a snapshot of their hive’s immediate surroundings. Researchers continue to be concerned about the effects of pollution from the Notre-Dame fire. In a study of lead levels in Parisian soils published earlier this month, scientists at Columbia University found that people living within 1,100 yards and downwind of the fire were likely to have been exposed to more lead fallout than previously announced. Previous investigations by the French news website Mediapart and later by The New York Times found unsafe lead levels in dozens of places across Paris, including schools, parks and day-care centers. City and state authorities did not order lead testing until a month after the fire, and it took four months to complete a full decontamination of the cathedral’s neighborhood. If ingested, lead can produce cognitive damage, especially in children. City officials have acknowledged that Paris needs a more comprehensive lead-abatement plan, and scientists are investigating whether rainwater dropping from the roof of Notre-Dame may have polluted the Seine river for centuries. Professor Weis, the other lead author of the study, was in Paris the day after the fire and said she has stayed far from the cathedral out of fear of lead exposure. Although the lead levels measured in the honey accounted for “80 drops of water in an Olympic swimming pool,” she said, they should still act as a warning. “For Paris, it’s not dramatically high and it doesn’t mean that the honey cannot be eaten,” Professor Weis added about the lead levels. “But honey here is the canary in the coal mine.”']","Bees can act as tiny pollution detectors, say researchers, who found higher but still safe lead levels in honey gathered downwind of the cathedral."
Turkey Passes Law Extending Sweeping Powers Over Social Media,2020-07-29,By Marc Santora,"['Turkish lawmakers passed legislation on Wednesday that would give the government sweeping new powers to regulate social media content, raising concerns that one of the few remaining spaces for free public debate in the country could fall under greater government control. The bill orders social media platforms with over one million daily users — such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube — to open offices in Turkey and imposes stiff penalties if the international companies refuse, including slowing the bandwidth of the sites and making them largely inaccessible. These offices would be responsible for responding to the demands of the government and individuals to block or remove content hosted on their platforms that is deemed offensive. They would have 48 hours to comply and could be fined more than $700,000 if they fail to respond.  The new law, which is expected to go into effect  Oct. 1, also requires the social media companies to store user data inside Turkey, raising privacy concerns. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his governing A.K.P. party, having already taken control over most of the nation’s traditional media outlets, were behind the legislation, arguing that it was needed to protect citizens from cybercrime and slander. Critics, however, say it is part of a broader effort to control the flow of information in the country and stifle dissent. “The new law will enable the government to control social media, to get content removed at will and to arbitrarily target individual users,” Tom Porteous, deputy program director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement released hours before the overnight vote. “Social media is a lifeline for many people who use it to access news, so this law signals a new dark era of online censorship.” The attempts to gain control over social media in Turkey highlight the paradox the platforms present in the digital age.  They have been used to spread disinformation in Western democracies, including by hostile foreign powers bent on sowing chaos and influencing elections. Efforts by social media platforms to police the content they host have repeatedly fallen short, and governments have yet to devise successful strategies to regulate content without unwittingly infringing on free speech.   But they have also proved to be an increasingly essential tool for debate and dialogue in repressive and autocratic nations, one of the last arenas where opposition figures can connect with the public, and citizens can attempt to hold politicians to account.  More than 90 percent of Turkey’s conventional media is now controlled by conglomerates close to the government. Hundreds of reporters have been jailed or fled the country out of fear and Mr. Erdogan has made himself so omnipresent on TV and radio that his voice can drown out all others. The internet is now, for many,  the last open public forum. In passing the bill,  supporters acknowledged that it would allow the government to exert more authority in the digital realm. “Today, while all the conventional media is acting within a certain discipline and order, we will be regulating social media who is acting entirely on its own,” Cahit Ozkan, deputy head of the A.K.P., said on Tuesday in televised remarks. Mr. Erdogan has made no secret of his disdain for social media and of his desire to exert control over digital spaces, much in the same way his government has gained control over traditional media. Six years ago, when he was embroiled in a corruption scandal widely reported on social media, he vowed to restrict access to the sites. “We will not allow this nation to be devoured by YouTube, Facebook or whatever,” Mr. Erdogan said at the time. “We will take necessary steps in the firmest way.” In 2016, months before an attempted coup, Turkey moved even more aggressively to censor content on the internet, as the number of people prosecuted for insulting Mr. Erdogan in posts on social media skyrocketed. At the same time, internet trolls loyal to the government used social media platforms to attack critics and journalists.  In 2017, the country shocked many international observers when it banned Wikipedia, a restriction that was lifted only this past January. Last summer, Turkey gave its media regulatory authority sweeping control over streaming services, including entertainment sites like Netflix.  Netflix, which is the most prominent streaming service in Turkey, has already run into difficulties with Turkish censors and has had to edit content of its Turkish-produced programs, removing cigarettes and blurring suggestive gestures. Last week, Netflix canceled its fourth Turkish production a day before filming was scheduled to begin, after the Turkish media regulatory authority refused permission for filming. Ece Yorenc, the screenplay writer, said the authority had refused to grant permission for the series “If Only” because of a gay character in the series. Netflix chose to cancel the entire series rather than change the content, she said. The issue of social media content took a personal turn more recently, when Mr. Erdogan’s newborn grandson — the fourth child of his daughter, Esra Albayrak, and Berat Albayrak, who is also the  finance minister — was insulted on various social media platforms. “Those spaces where lies, defamation, attack to personal rights, character assassinations are running wild, should be put in order,” Mr. Erdogan told party officials in a televised speech on July 1. “We want such social media spaces to be entirely removed, to be controlled,” he added. But criticism of the law was swift, filling the very sites the government was seeking to control. Yaman Akdeniz, an expert in online rights, wrote on Twitter that “a new and dark period in Turkey is starting.” “The aim is to silence,” he wrote. “It is the intention of the government to clean its past from critical content including news coverage of corruption allegations as well as all sorts of irregularities.” Even without the new bill, Turkey blocked access to more than 400,000 websites by the end of 2019, according to Mr. Akdeniz, whose organization, the Freedom of Expression Association, compiles an annual report on internet access in the country. According to his analysis, last year more than 130,000 web addresses were blocked; 40,000 posts on Twitter taken down; 10,000 YouTube videos removed; and 6,200 Facebook posts scrubbed from the site.  The new bill will give the government even greater freedom to remove content of independent news outlets which are the almost the only source of unbiased local news coverage in Turkish. For many in Turkey, social media is also the last forum where they can publicly express grievances on topics raging from violence against women to political corruption. Before the vote, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that the law “would give the state powerful tools for asserting even more control over the media landscape.” Quinn McKew, executive director of Article 19, an advocacy group for an open internet and free expression, said that the law placed companies in a difficult position.  “Social media companies face either becoming the long arm of the state censorship or having access to their platforms slowed so much that they are in effect blocked in Turkey,” she said. “Given the erosion of the rule of law in Turkey under the current government, tech companies cannot rely on the courts to challenge blocking decisions or requests for user data.” Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on the bill. According to Twitter’s transparency report for the first half of 2019, Turkey had the highest number of content removal request, with more than 6,000. Raymond Zhong, Adam Satariano and Carlotta Gall contributed reporting.  ']","The legislation extends control over platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Boris Johnson’s New Tactic Against the Virus: Urge Britons to Lose Weight,2020-07-27,By Anna Schaverien,"['LONDON — Britain will crack down on junk food advertising and introduce calorie counts on menus in an effort to tackle obesity and ease the pressure on the country’s National Health Service amid the coronavirus pandemic, the government said on Monday. For the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the intersection of obesity and the coronavirus is personal. Mr. Johnson was, by his own admission, “way overweight” when he was admitted to the hospital after becoming ill with Covid-19 this year, and his health deteriorated to such an extent that at one point he needed intensive care. Studies have linked obesity to a greater risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19, and Mr. Johnson, writing in the British newspaper The Daily Express, described his time in hospital as a “wake-up call.” “We all put things off — I know I have,” Mr. Johnson wrote. “I’ve wanted to lose weight for ages, and like many people I struggle with my weight.” “I go up and down, but during the whole coronavirus epidemic and when I got it, too, I realized how important it is not to be overweight,” he added. As part of the government’s new obesity strategy, advertisements for any food high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned on television and online until 9 p.m. to avoid hours when children are most likely to see them. There will also be a consultation on whether Britain should entirely ban online ads for junk food. All large restaurants and cafes will be required to add a calorie count to their menus, and the government will look into adding calorie labels to alcoholic drinks. Promotional offers like “buy one, get one free” on fatty or sugary foods will also be prohibited. Obesity in Britain has long been cited as a growing problem and as a drain on the N.H.S., and the country is usually near the top of lists ranking Europe’s fattest countries. Government statistics show almost two-thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese. The World Health Organization estimates that about 39 percent of adults worldwide are overweight and that around 13 percent are obese. More than 45,000 people in Britain have died from the coronavirus. Nearly 8 percent of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units have been morbidly obese, the British government said, even though morbidly obese people account for only 2.9 percent of the general population. Mr. Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter on Monday that he had lost more than 14 pounds since his time in the hospital. The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, reported that the prime minister weighed 245 pounds when he was hospitalized in April. Even with his recent slimming, Mr. Johnson, who is about 5 feet 10 inches tall, would still rank as obese, according to an N.H.S. calculator, though the prime minister said he had only just started concentrating on building his fitness and losing weight. The wide-ranging measures announced on Monday are a change in tack for Mr. Johnson, who last year described a levy on sugary drinks as “sin stealth taxes” and warned of the “continuing creep of the nanny state.” Professor Parveen Kumar, a spokeswoman for the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said in a statement on Monday that the strategy “could go a long way in kick-starting a health revolution for the nation.” But the measures did not receive such a warm welcome from the food and retail industry. Tim Rycroft, the chief operating officer at the Food and Drink Federation, a group representing manufacturers in the sector, called the plans a “punishing blow” for companies that had been “heralded by government for feeding the nation during the Covid crisis.” The federation said that, while it supported the government’s push for Britain to become healthier, the proposed policies had been shown to be ineffective and would serve only to raise prices.']","The prime minister, who cited his own problems with obesity, said his hospitalization with Covid-19 had prompted his push to tighten regulations on junk food."
Belarus Says Russian Mercenaries Planned to Disrupt August Election,2020-07-29,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Escalating a simmering feud with Russia, its neighbor and longtime ally, Belarus on Wednesday charged that more than 200 mercenaries from Russia, disguised as tourists, had infiltrated Belarus on a mission to disrupt its presidential election. Reports of a Russian mercenary force in Belarus, which could not be independently confirmed, followed months of increasingly ill-tempered exchanges between Minsk and Moscow, close but fractious allies that used to be bound together by their shared wariness of the West, but are now intensely wary of each other. The news reinforced a narrative promoted in recent weeks by President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, who has ruled with an iron fist for 26 years, that widespread public discontent stemmed from foreign meddling, not his own unpopularity. Mr. Lukashenko has a long record of blaming foreigners for his troubles but has only recently turned his propaganda machine on Russia, rather than Western powers like the United States, previously his favorite target. Belta, Belarus’s official news agency, published the names and birth dates of 32 detained Russian fighters whom it described as employees of Wagner Group, a mercenary recruiting company linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The Russian embassy in Minsk said it had asked the Belarusian authorities about the reports of a mercenary force but had received no official information about any Russians being detained. Russia has long been Belarus’s closest ally and principal benefactor, and the two nations are bound together by language, similar political systems and a shared reverence for many aspects of the Soviet Union. But relations have soured dramatically as President Putin has pushed Mr. Lukashenko to implement a long-stalled plan to form a “union state,” effectively a merger of the two countries in which Russia, with 15 times as many people as Belarus, would be very much the senior partner. Mr. Lukashenko, who has a reputation for erratic behavior and wild claims, announced on Tuesday that he had been infected by the coronavirus but had fully recovered without treatment. That announcement was greeted with skepticism, as it played into his longstanding position that the pandemic poses no serious danger to public health and can be kept at bay by drinking vodka, riding tractors and playing ice hockey. In June, Mr. Lukashenko had two would-be rival candidates in Belarus’s Aug. 9 presidential elections arrested on corruption charges, claiming that he had thwarted a plot to foment revolution by Russian interests. On Wednesday, the government released video footage of a nighttime raid this week on a sanitarium near Minsk, where 32 Russian fighters were arrested; another one was arrested in a different part of the country. The video featured heavily armed officers from Belarus’s security service — still called, as in Soviet days, the K.G.B. — storming into guest rooms occupied by the alleged mercenaries. It showed a number of beefy Russians in handcuffs, one of them lying on the floor in boxer briefs, Russian passports and a stack of $100 bills. But belongings seized in the raid also included bank notes and telephone cards from Sudan and texts written in Arabic, which suggested the arrested Russians may have been en route to or from North Africa, rather than on a mission targeting Belarus. The arrested Russians, according to a report by Belta, aroused suspicion as soon as they arrived in Belarus because they had three heavy suitcases, wore military-style clothing and behaved in ways “uncharacteristic for Russian tourists,” shunning alcohol and avoiding night clubs. Wagner Group, the mercenary outfit accused of employing the men, has sent fighters, mostly veterans of Russia’s armed forces, to Syria, Libya, Sudan and various other countries. According to United States officials, it is controlled by Mr. Prigozhin, known as “Putin’s chef” because of his success in winning catering contracts from the Russian military. He has been indicted in the United States over meddling in the 2016 American presidential election by another of his ventures, the troll farm in St. Petersburg formally known as the Internet Research Agency. He has repeatedly denied any links to Wagner or to interference in the U.S. election. Zakhar Prilepin, a Russian writer who fought in eastern Ukraine in support of a separatist rebellion fomented and armed by Moscow, told Russian media on Wednesday that he recognized several of the arrested men shown by Belarusian television as veterans of his former unit in Donetsk, a Russian-speaking Ukrainian region that declared itself an independent, pro-Russian state in 2014. While the men may have been in Belarus, he said, they were probably headed to a mission elsewhere. Similarly, a social media channel run by a Russian war correspondent and often used by Russian mercenaries said the arrested Russians were most likely passing through Belarus on their way to conflict zones in Africa where Wagner fighters have been heavily involved in combat operations. President Lukashenko, however, painted Belarus as the target of the mercenary force and called an emergency meeting on Wednesday of his security council to discuss the Russian threat. Belta news agency quoted him as saying he had ordered the head of the Belarus K.G.B. to ask Russia “what is happening?” Such talk, critics say, is an attempt at distraction, as Mr. Lukashenko faces growing domestic opposition. Riot police units have intervened repeatedly and brutally to halt street protests in Minsk and other cities across the country since the arrests in June of two popular would-be candidates. A third prospective candidate, Belarus’s former ambassador to Washington, fled to Russia last week to avoid arrest. After the arrest of his strongest potential rival, Viktor Babariko, the former head of a Russian-owned bank, Mr. Lukashenko claimed that he had foiled a plot orchestrated from Moscow to overthrow his government. That claim was widely dismissed by independent observers as a clumsy attempt to rally Western support for his pre-election crackdown. The news that alleged Russian mercenaries had been arrested broke just hours after Mr. Lukashenko visited a Belarus military base, where he boasted to a gathering of army and riot police officers of his work to rebuild the country’s security and defense apparatus after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. “Nobody gave us anything, and we owe nothing to anyone,” he told the officers in an apparent snub to Russia, which has provided weapons and training to Belarus for years. Long adept at maneuvering between Russia and the West to extract political and economic favors, Mr. Lukashenko has increasingly tilted away from Moscow in recent months, particularly since a visit to Minsk in February by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. After that visit, the first by a secretary of state since the early 1990s, Washington appointed its first ambassador to Belarus in more than a decade and both countries pledged to improve their previously frozen relations.

An American Mustache That Irritated South Koreans Is No More,2020-07-27,By Tiffany May,"['The mustache, a thick salt-and-pepper number neatly shaped into a chevron, had survived questions, protests and even Photoshopped ridicule. But it has met its match: the long, sticky days of a Korean pandemic summer. At least that was the account given by the American ambassador to South Korea, Harry B. Harris Jr., as he walked into a Seoul barbershop. He sat down for a clean shave of a bit of facial hair he had held fast to for two years, even as it threatened to escalate diplomatic tensions. Some in South Korea had viewed the mustache worn by Mr. Harris, a Japanese-American, as a distasteful reminder of those worn by the colonial Japanese governors who ruled Korea from 1910 to 1945, a period that holds traumatic memories on the peninsula. Mr. Harris long maintained that he meant no disrespect with his mustache, which he said he had grown for his retirement as a Navy admiral. This weekend, though, he said that the facial hair had become intolerable under the masks he had been wearing in the muggy heat. “For some people, they can wear a mask and have a mustache or a beard. But for me, it’s just uncomfortable in this heat, and I have to wear a mask,” Mr. Harris said in a video posted on Saturday by the U.S. Embassy. The video, which showed him bumping elbows with a barber in a traditional wood-paneled shop before settling in for his shave, was produced in the style of a cheerful game show, punctuated by dramatic sound effects and captions in bubble font. Draped in pink towels, Mr. Harris rolled his eyes to comic effect when the barber dipped his black leather seat backward and brought a pale green razor to his face. “Glad I did this. For me, it was either keep the ‘stache or lose the mask,” Mr. Harris wrote in a tweet on Saturday. Mr. Harris, who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American Navy officer, became ambassador to South Korea in 2018. One of the first questions he was asked upon landing in the country was about his mustache, with some South Koreans wondering if it was a calculated insult. In 2019, demonstrators protesting the cost of hosting U.S. troops in South Korea held placards with Photoshopped cat whiskers on his face. In an interview with The Korea Times in December, Mr. Harris said that the mustache reflected his new life as a diplomat after a four-decade career in the Navy that required him to be clean-shaven at most times. He said his ethnicity had no bearing on his work in the embassy, adding: “I’m American ambassador to Korea, not the Japanese-American ambassador to Korea.” Asked at the time whether he would shave in order to improve his relationship with South Koreans, he said he would keep the facial hair. “You would have to convince me that somehow the mustache is viewed in a way that hurts our relationship,” he said.']","Blaming the summer’s heat, the U.S. ambassador lopped off a bit of facial hair that had reminded some of brutal colonial Japan."
Latin America Is Facing a ‘Decline of Democracy’ Under the Pandemic,2020-07-29,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['CARACAS, Venezuela — Postponed elections. Sidelined courts. A persecuted opposition. As the coronavirus pandemic tears through Latin America and the Caribbean, killing more than 180,000 and destroying the livelihoods of tens of millions in the region, it is also undermining democratic norms that were already under strain. Leaders ranging from the center-right to the far left have used the crisis as justification to extend their time in office, weaken oversight of government actions and silence critics — actions that under different circumstances would be described as authoritarian and antidemocratic but that now are being billed as lifesaving measures to curb the spread of the disease. The gradual undermining of democratic rules during an economic crisis and public health catastrophe could leave Latin America primed for slower growth and an increase in corruption and human rights abuses, experts warned. This is particularly true in places where political rights and accountability were already in steep decline. “It’s not a matter of left or right, it’s a general decline of democracy across the region,” said Alessandra Pinna, a Latin America researcher at Freedom House, an independent Washington-based research organization that measures global political liberties. There are now five Latin American and Caribbean nations with recent democratic histories  — Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guyana, Bolivia and Haiti — where governments weren’t chosen in free and fair elections or have overstayed their time in office. It’s the highest number since the late 1980s, when the Cold War receded and several countries in the grips of civil war or military dictatorships transitioned to peace and democracy. Most of these leaders were already bending the rules of democracy to stay in power before the pandemic, but seized on emergency conditions created by the spread of the virus to strengthen their position. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has detained or raided the homes of dozens of journalists, social activists and opposition leaders for questioning the government’s dubious coronavirus figures. In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega released thousands of inmates because of the threat posed by the virus, but kept political prisoners behind bars, while in Guyana, a lockdown prevented protests against the government’s attempt to stay in power despite losing an election. In Bolivia, a caretaker government has used the pandemic to postpone elections, tap into emergency aid to bolster its electoral campaign and threaten to ban the main opposition candidate from running. And in the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, the government imposed a strict lockdown on its 50,000 people during the campaign for general elections in June, hampering opposition efforts to meet voters while also keeping international election observers from traveling to the country. It was the first time that the Organization of American States, a regional group that promotes democracy, had its invitation to observe elections withdrawn by a host country in recent history. The loss of public trust in Latin America is not new, but the erosion of democratic norms in the pandemic arrived at a time when the region’s economic growth and social progress were already unraveling, leaving many uncertain about the ability of democratic leaders to solve entrenched problems such as inequality, crime and corruption. By 2018, only one in four Latin Americans said they were satisfied with democracy — the lowest number since Latinobarómetro, a regional polling company, began asking that question 25 years ago. Discontent with the political establishment led to a wave of populist victories in recent years, including President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who is on the far right, and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, who is on the left. It also led to mass street protests in several Latin American countries last year. The pandemic, hitting during this time of political upheaval, has plunged the region into the deepest recession in its history, exacerbating weaknesses in health and welfare systems and highlighting the ways in which many leaders are unable to meet public demands. “All the things that Latin Americans have already been clamoring for — greater equality, better services — have been dramatically worsened by the pandemic,” said Cynthia Arnson, Latin America program director at the Wilson Center, a think-tank in Washington. “The economic pain is dramatic, and it’s putting additional strain on the already-weak institutions.” It has also put a strain on the region’s struggling health care systems. Latin America has become a global hot spot for the virus, with Brazil, Mexico and Peru among the 10 nations with the highest number of deaths. And according to the United Nations, about 16 million Latin Americans are expected to fall into extreme poverty this year, reversing nearly all the gains made by the region this century. Adding to these challenges, democracy in Latin America has also lost a champion in the United States, which had played an important role in promoting democracy after the end of the Cold War by financing good governance programs and calling out authoritarian abuses. Under President Trump, the United States has mostly focused regional policy on opposing left-wing autocrats in Venezuela and Cuba and curbing immigration, making aid to Central American nations, among the region’s poorest, contingent on cooperating with the administration on immigration. The Trump administration also refrained from commenting when Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, ignored Supreme Court rulings and used the military to crack down on quarantine violators during the pandemic. American support for democracy initiatives in Latin America fell by almost half last year to $326 million, according to preliminary figures compiled by the United States Agency for International Development. “In the last few years, we have not only abandoned our role as a democratizing force in Latin America and the world, but we have promoted negative forces,” said Orlando Pérez, a political scientist at the University of North Texas. “Our policy is now: ‘You’re on your own — America first.’” In the few democratic strongholds in Latin America, such as Uruguay and Costa Rica, leaders responded to the pandemic with efficiency and transparency, boosting public trust in the government. In the Dominican Republic and Suriname, incumbent presidents recently bowed out of power after losing elections that were held despite the pandemic. In many instances, judges and civil servants have resisted the attacks on democratic institutions during the pandemic, said Javier Corrales, a professor of Latin American studies at Amherst College in Massachusetts. “The defenders of liberal democracy in Latin America are not defeated,” said Mr. Corrales. “It’s not an open terrain for would-be authoritarians.” Yet in most Latin American nations, the coronavirus accelerated a pre-existing democratic decline by exposing the weakness and corruption of governments in the face of the catastrophe. “When confronted with an existential threat, countries that did not already have deep democratic systems are choosing tactics that help leaders consolidate their power,” said John Polga-Hecimovich, a political scientist at the United States Naval Academy in Maryland. The political tensions gripping the region in the pandemic could be just the beginning of a longer wave of unrest and authoritarianism, said Thomas Carothers, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It will drag the region down into poorer economic performance,” he said. “It also means poorer treatment of human beings, their dignity and rights.” Natalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from Mexico City.

Australia Says Chinese Students Are Targets in ‘Virtual Kidnapping’ Scams,2020-07-28,By Damien Cave,"['SYDNEY, Australia — The young woman’s parents in China believed the video was real. It seemed to show their 21-year-old daughter pleading for help somewhere in Australia. She had been out of touch for days. She looked to be in pain, and the perpetrators pointed to only one solution: a six-figure ransom payment. The woman’s family deposited the money in an offshore bank account. But it was all a scam. A few hours after the woman’s housemate contacted the police in Sydney on July 14, she was found safe and sound at a hotel, where she had been lured by the scam artists. Now, the Australian authorities are warning that “virtual kidnappings” could be on the rise as anonymous criminals seek to exploit Chinese students in the country and their families back home, many of whom are already on edge and isolated because of the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the police in New South Wales said there had been at least eight confirmed cases this year, with more than $2 million paid in ransom for abductions that never happened. “The victims of virtual kidnappings we have engaged are traumatized by what has occurred, believing they have placed themselves, and their loved ones, in real danger,” said Peter Thurtell, the assistant commissioner of the New South Wales police force. The recent spree points to the evolution of a crime that exploits oversharing and fear for a distant loved one with digital savvy and old-fashioned coercion by con artists. Since at least the 1990s, criminal gangs from Taiwan and China to Mexico and Cuba have been persuading families to pay ransom for simulated kidnappings, often with personal information provided intentionally or unintentionally by the victims. Last year, extortionists called hotel rooms on the American side of the U.S.-Mexico border and convinced guests that armed enforcers were nearby, and that they needed to drive across the border and switch to a Mexican hotel, where they had to take a screenshot of themselves that the criminals then used to persuade loved ones to pay a ransom. In the Sydney form of the scam, which the authorities said they first started seeing a few years ago, robocalls deliver messages to thousands of random phones purporting to be from a messenger service. It says a package needs to be delivered. Those who continue on the call are greeted by someone speaking Mandarin who asks for basic identity information — name, address, phone number, anything else of import — and promises to call back. For the Chinese students in Australia — whose ranks have swelled in recent years, with 212,000 enrolled last year — the return calls have come from someone who claims to be from the Chinese government, bearing bad news: The supposed package to be delivered holds illegal contents or is somehow connected to a larger crime that could get that person deported or imprisoned, or get one of their relatives hurt. To be safe, the caller tells the mark, the person must check into a hotel and turn off the phone. And, oh, don’t tell anyone or else what’s already bad will become downright horrific. “Especially for Chinese students, here without any support from family, they get scared when they get information like this,” said Prof. Lennon Chang, a senior lecturer in criminal justice at Monash University who has studied the scam. “The talented criminals understand this psychological emotion and use it as a way to lead the students under the pass.” The scammers use technology to bolster the fraud. Professor Chang said they usually mask where they call from, presenting a number from the Chinese Embassy that can be found online. In some cases, they ask the victim to send a photo, or alter what they find online to create an image or video that seems to show the person kidnapped. The parents, far away, usually receive the ransom demand by phone and are then sent what appears to be evidence of a crime. Worried about their children, perhaps after reading about actual kidnappings of Chinese students in Canada and in the United States, some parents in China comply. In one case from Sydney last month, a family paid 2 million Australian dollars ($1.4 million) to the unknown criminals. In the other cases, payments ranged from a few thousand dollars to more than $200,000. “During this period of time, with the pandemic and with less human contact, the parents might not know who to contact if they get a message like that, or for the student, they might not be able to talk to people they trust to verify whether this kind of message is true,” Professor Chang said. “This kind of isolation might create some opportunity for criminals.” When the police have been called, it has typically taken them only a few hours to uncover what had really happened. But the names of victims have been rarely publicized, and no masterminds have been identified. On Tuesday, the Australian authorities reminded people to report anyone they suspected of pretending to be from the Chinese government. “NSW Police have been assured from the Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney that no person claiming to be from a Chinese authority such as police, procuratorates or the courts will contact a student on their mobile phone and demand monies to be paid or transferred,” said Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Bennett. “If this occurs,” he added, “it is a scam.” Tiffany May contributed reporting from Hong Kong.']",Recent cases reveal the evolution of a crime that often exploits worry over family members abroad with digital savvy and old-fashioned coercion.
"In Russia’s Far East, a New Face of Resistance to Putin’s Reign",2020-07-28,By Anton Troianovski,"['KHABAROVSK, Russia — Valentin Kvashnikov, a construction worker and recovering heroin addict, lives near the railway depot in a wooden shack, with a plastic trash can in the corner that serves as his toilet. But he has risen from obscurity into a celebrity in far eastern Russia by helping to energize the antigovernment demonstrations that have gotten bigger and bolder in the past three weeks. “It’s him!” a passing woman, Natasha Gordiyenko, said after she spotted Mr. Kvashnikov outside his house on Sunday, before unleashing a tirade of profanity against Russian officialdom. The protests in Khabarovsk reached well into the tens of thousands over the weekend, establishing this distant city — some 4,000 miles from Moscow — as the site of the biggest popular challenge to President Vladimir V. Putin’s authority that a city in Russia’s far-flung regions has produced in his 20 years in power. The protests have no leader and few concrete demands. But they have electrified a quiet city half a world away from the capital, turning apolitical residents into activists overnight and showing how quickly the embers of discontent over corruption, poverty and the stranglehold of Mr. Putin’s rule can ignite a conflagration. “It’s not that there is something wrong with us,” said Elena Okhrimenko, a retired accountant, who has been protesting with homemade signs along with her husband, a retired truck driver. “We realized that there is something wrong with the country.” The involvement of protesters from a broad cross-section of the city, an eight-hour flight from Moscow and only 15 miles from China, is a new kind of warning for the Kremlin. For years, large-scale protests have mainly been limited to Moscow and St. Petersburg, making them easy to dismiss as the work of an out-of-touch urban elite. Yet the well of popular anger so far from the capital undercuts the Kremlin’s narrative of Mr. Putin’s Russia, which he has essentially ruled for the past two decades. Mr. Putin won a heavily orchestrated referendum less than a month ago that rewrote the Constitution to allow him to stay in office until 2036. But many analysts have called the vote fraudulent, and while pollsters have identified rising discontent among Russians in recent years, the anger has never spilled into the streets with such force outside the nation’s biggest cities. “For now, society doesn’t appear to be so radicalized as to storm the gates, if you will,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research organization focused on politics and policy. “But from my point of view, that is only a question of time if the authorities are not able to see what is really happening in the country.” Mr. Kvashnikov, long struggling with poverty and grousing at the state’s injustice, turned into a bullhorn-carrying cheerleader of protesters who have marched through the city each day since July 11 in defense of their popular governor, Sergei I. Furgal, who was arrested by the federal authorities this month. The protesters gather in Lenin Square in front of the marble-sheathed hulk of the regional government headquarters — known locally as the White House — before spilling into the road for a three-mile loop above the sprawling Amur River. Cars honk in support, drivers offer high-fives and marveling bystanders — the ice-cream vendor, the cosmetics shop security guard, the officer in front of the railway-company building —\xa0have their phones out to record the scene. “I never believed our people were so united,” Mr. Kvashnikov said, describing the protests. The protests have drawn their ranks from political novices like Elena Skorodumova, a 23-year-old kindergarten teacher’s assistant. On July 9, she was scrolling through a social media page devoted to local news and pets when she saw a post about the arrest of Mr. Furgal, the governor. In a sharp blue suit, Mr. Furgal was pictured being led away by a masked Federal Security Service officer in camouflage gear, a gloved hand pressing down on the governor’s head. Ms. Skorodumova recalls that she got goose bumps from her anger. The “only way” to support the governor, she wrote in the comments, was to “go out in the streets.” The arrest of the governor, on suspicion of having organized murders some 15 years ago, seemed to many residents a blatant power play by the Kremlin to get rid of a regional leader seen as insufficiently loyal. Mr. Furgal, a former scrap metal trader, defeated the incumbent, a widely disliked ally of Mr. Putin’s, in the 2018 regional election. Then Mr. Furgal won over residents with a populist style that his staff assiduously documented on Instagram. Officially dismissed by Mr. Putin last week, Mr. Furgal had highlighted how he set aside millions of dollars for school lunches, cut his own pay and put the governor’s yacht on the market. More calls for protest over his arrest coursed through social media, often in the coded language of invitations for a stroll or “feeding the pigeons” in the central square. On July 11, a Saturday, Ms. Skorodumova, the teacher’s assistant, packed sanitizing wipes and a toothbrush in case she got arrested and went to Lenin Square. She had never protested before. Tens of thousands of her fellow residents also came. And they keep coming back. Mr. Kvashnikov, the construction worker, found a wellspring of people who shared his disdain for Mr. Putin and what he sees as a system that enriches the few. He has scarcely enough money to eat, he said, and had been involved in criminal groups and done time in prison in an earlier life. “You rabid dog, why don’t you deal with what is under your own nose?” he said of Mr. Putin. “Your people are hungry. Look at how your people live.” Mr. Kvashnikov drew the attention of the many YouTubers livestreaming the protests by his almost daily attendance, his loud chants and his readiness to defy the police. In one widely viewed video, he can be seen shouting at a police officer that the Russian Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly. The crowd next to him starts chanting “We’re the ones in charge here!” The crowds of demonstrators have grown for three consecutive Saturdays, with some estimates putting last weekend’s crowd at more than 50,000 — a spurt of spontaneous political activism that is rare in Russia. Alyona Panteleyeva, 22, and her mother run a cramped sewing workshop and fabric store. She said she had never been involved in politics until one of her employees suggested producing face masks that say “I Am/We Are Furgal.” For the past week, the workshop has been producing about 50 masks a day, and Ms. Panteleyeva said she was selling them at cost over Instagram and in her store. The first person who bought one, she said, paid in cash marked with a pro-Furgal slogan; such bills are increasingly in circulation in the city, she explained. “I am sure that the protests will continue until the citizens get what they want,” including a public trial for Mr. Furgal in Khabarovsk, rather than in Moscow, she said. “We are fighting for the truth.” Mr. Furgal’s popularity as a regional elected official is unique, so the Khabarovsk protests are not likely to be replicated elsewhere, the social scientist Sergei Belanovsky wrote recently. But they show an increased willingness to protest in response to any number of slights. “Given the overall unfavorable economic and social situation, the reasons to protest keep growing in number,” Mr. Belanovsky said. “The fabric of the state has thinned, and to tear it requires less and less effort.” Mr. Putin remains in control of the country’s powerful security services, and, though in decline, his approval rating stands at 60 percent. A major question is to what extent the Kremlin will be prepared to use force to put down protests — it has done so in Moscow but not yet in Khabarovsk. At one point on Monday, a sole police officer followed the column of roughly 1,000 protesters, apparently to keep the cars at bay. Many protesters assume that some police officers sympathize with them. Analysts also say that the Kremlin seems to be hoping the protests will fade on their own, and the state media has largely ignored them. Meanwhile, the authorities seem to be putting pressure on some activists. Late Sunday evening in Lenin Square, videos showed Mr. Kvashnikov haranguing a man in plainclothes who he said had threatened him, then being wrestled to the ground by other people in plainclothes; he was carried by his ankles, chest and elbows to a waiting police car. Hours later, the authorities released Mr. Kvashnikov. Waiting video bloggers were there to record his walk from the police station. Mr. Kvashnikov had already let his fans know that he was taking a break from protesting, for his family’s safety. “Don’t be afraid and keep at it, friends,” Mr. Kvashnikov said in a video message recorded on Sunday. “Most important, don’t abandon what we started together.” Oleg Matsnev contributed research from Moscow.']","As the protests swell in the city of Khabarovsk, 4,000 miles from Moscow, residents who had never before found a public outlet for anger are becoming activists."
Trump Falsely Claims Much of U.S. Is ‘Corona-Free’,2020-07-28,,"['Read our live Coronavirus Pandemic coverage here.  President Trump returned to defending a discredited drug at a White House briefing Tuesday evening in which he also made claims about the trajectory of the virus that clash with his own administration’s assessments and bemoaned his low approval ratings. The president defended sharing a version of a video promoting the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine that was deleted Monday night by Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which all said that the video had violated their policies on sharing misinformation about the virus. He claimed that “you can look at large portions of our country — it’s corona-free,” even as federal officials distributed a new report finding that 21 states had outbreaks so severe that they were in the “red zone.” Twenty-eight states were in the “yellow zone,” and only one state, Vermont, was in the “green zone.” And he lamented that health officials in his administration, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, were more popular than he is. “He’s got this high approval rating,” Mr. Trump said. “Why don’t I have a high approval rating — and the administration — with respect to the virus?” “They’re highly thought of, but nobody likes me,” he said. “It can only be my personality.” Mr. Trump continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, which several major studies have concluded is not effective in treating the virus. “I happen to think it works in the early stages,”  he said, and claimed that “from a safety standpoint it’s safe.” Federal health officials have warned of dangers. In June the Food and Drug Administration revoked an emergency use authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and another malaria drug, chloroquine, in the treatment of Covid-19. In a July 1 update, the F.D.A. said there were reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries and liver problems and failure. In revoking the emergency use authorization, the F.D.A. said, “We made this determination based on recent results from a large, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients that found these medicines showed no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery.” Asked on “Good Morning America” about the president’s sharing of claims about hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Fauci said that the “prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.” At the briefing, Mr. Trump was asked about one of the speakers in the video, who identified herself as Dr. Stella Immanuel. She claimed “you don’t need masks” to prevent the spread of the virus and spoke of treating hundreds of virus patients with hydroxychloroquine. He called her “impressive.” “She was on air along with many other doctors,” he said. “They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine. And I thought she was very impressive in the sense that from where she came — I don’t know which country she comes from —  but she says she’s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. And I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.” Dr. Immanuel has drawn scrutiny for a series of religious sermons posted on her YouTube channel, in which she linked medical conditions to sex with demons and witches, as well as making references to alien DNA. When a reporter mentioned Dr. Immanuel’s background to the president, including comments attributed to her that “doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens,” Mr. Trump responded, “I know nothing about her,” and abruptly ended the briefing moments later. Key Data of the DAY A new federal report found that the number of states with outbreaks serious enough to place them in the “red zone” had grown to 21, and urged officials in them to impose more restrictions. The 21 states now in the “red zone” — Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin — were designated as such because they had more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Three more states were added to the most serious category since a similar report dated July 14: Missouri, North Dakota and Wisconsin.  The findings in the new report, which contained profiles of each state, were sent to state officials by the White House’s coronavirus task force and obtained by The New York Times. The report, which was dated July 26, recommended that more restrictions be put in place in “red zone” states. But on Monday, a day later, President Trump called for more states to reopen. “A lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening, and we’ll see what happens with them,” Mr. Trump said during a visit to North Carolina — one of the states in the red zone.  The report recommended that North Carolina “close establishments where social distancing and mask use cannot occur, such as bars” and “limit indoor dining to less than 25% of normal capacity.” It made similar recommendations for other hard-hit states, calling for reducing the occupancy of other businesses, closing gyms, and urging people to scale back their public interactions and activities to a quarter of what they normally are.  Mask mandates were consistently recommended for states and cities where the virus is spreading. Noting that Arizona, included in the red zone, had seen cases level off in recent days, the report credited its “aggressive mitigation efforts of mask wearing, social distancing and closing bars.” But some governors continue to be resistant. When Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, visited Tennessee on Monday, she spoke with Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, about mask mandates, but he was loath to issue a statewide order. “We talked about statewide mandates; we also talked about alternative approaches,” he said afterward.  The report put it more bluntly: “Statewide mask mandate is critical to stop the spread.” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, said in an interview Tuesday on “Good Morning America” that he was concerned about rising positivity rates in several states, and that officials should heed federal guidelines when deciding whether to open up. “I think we can prevent the surges that we’ve seen in the Southern states, because we just can’t afford, yet again, another surge,” he said. Currently, Vermont is the only state in the “green zone” category for cases, with less than 10 cases a week per 100,000 people. The remaining 28 states and the District of Columbia were placed in the “yellow zone.” The report considers some hard-hit local areas in those states to be in the “red zone” as well. Top Democrats indicated they would be unwilling to accept anything less than an extension of the current $600 weekly unemployment insurance benefits, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, told reporters after a private meeting on Tuesday, a demand that is all but certain to be rejected by the majority of Senate Republicans.  Democrats also said they viewed another infusion of relief for state and local governments as a significant priority, Mr. Meadows said. In the meeting on Capitol Hill, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, “indicated they weren’t willing to negotiate down on the unemployment benefit,” Mr. Meadows said.  That demand is all but certain to be rejected by the majority of Senate Republicans, many of whom do not want to approve any additional aid beyond what is already provided through traditional unemployment benefits. The Republican $1 trillion proposal would not extend the benefit and would instead maintain a flat $200 extra per week above regular unemployment benefits. That amount would ultimately be replaced with a new system of calculating federal aid that would cap benefits at about 70 percent of a worker’s prior income. Additional funding for state and local governments was also raised, but the top Democrats did not explicitly say that the nearly $1 trillion allocated in the Democratic opening offer was a red line, Mr. Meadows said. “Just the beginning of the talks,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said as he left the office Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, late Tuesday afternoon. Both enhanced unemployment insurance benefits and state and local funding form some of the largest policy gulfs between Republicans and Democrats, who are beginning an intense round of negotiations over another coronavirus relief package to shore up the economy.  While Democrats have been publicly united behind the $3 trillion stimulus proposal the House approved in May, Republicans are in near open revolt over their own $1 trillion proposal, which top lawmakers unveiled on Monday.  While “united in disagreement,” as Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, put it, several Republicans have said they would not support a full extension of the unemployment insurance benefit, arguing that it discourages workers from returning to their jobs. Republicans are also at odds with the White House over President Trump’s insistence that the next bill include $1.75 billion for the construction of a new F.B.I. headquarters in downtown Washington. Mr. McConnell, under fire for embracing an obsession of Mr. Trump’s, said he favored dropping the F.B.I. provision from his party’s emergency pandemic aid proposal, along with other provisions unrelated to the virus.  He did not say whether that applied to more than $1 billion for military projects included in the plan for projects that Mr. Trump defunded earlier this year to pay for a wall on the southern border, his signature 2016 campaign promise. Both proposals drew outrage from Democrats, who said the president and his Republican allies were using the economic stabilization package — meant to help struggling Americans weather a pandemic and a recession — to further Mr. Trump’s personal and political agenda. The second-largest teachers’ union in the United States announced on Tuesday that it would support its 1.7 million members if they chose to strike in districts and states that moved to reopen classrooms without adequate health and safety measures. The union, the American Federation of Teachers, said strikes should be a “last resort.” But the resolution approved by the organization’s executive council gives educators and their union representatives additional muscle in negotiations over what would constitute adequate protection for teachers and school employees.  The union is pushing for schools to wait to reopen classrooms until coronavirus transmission rates in a community fall below 1 percent and average daily test positivity rates stay below 5 percent — something that very few places have achieved. A recent New York Times analysis found that only two of the nation’s 10 largest school districts could reopen under the latter threshold.  The union also wants effective contact tracing in place in regions that reopen schools, mask requirements for students and teachers, updated ventilation systems in school buildings and procedures to maintain six feet of distance between individuals. Randi Weingarten, the union’s president, said that if the federal government could support the cruise industry and hedge funds during the crisis, “they sure as hell can help working families, and can help educators ensure our kids get the education they need.” Education leaders have said they need hundreds of billions of dollars for measures that would allow schools to reopen safely. On Monday, Senate Republicans introduced a stimulus package that fell far short of what Democrats and organized labor have proposed. The measure would provide $70 billion for K-12 education but condition two-thirds of that money on schools’ reopening at least partially in person, a priority for Mr. Trump, who sees it as critical to reviving the nation’s economy by allowing parents to work. The A.F.T.’s authorization vote leaves it up to local chapters to make the decision on whether to plan a strike. The Florida Education Association has already sued Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials to prevent school buildings from reopening in that state, where virus cases are surging. On Tuesday, Florida again broke its daily record for deaths, reporting 186 fatalities. It also reported 9,230 new cases. Less than a week into its long-delayed season, Major League Baseball’s schedule fell into turmoil Tuesday as the number of positive tests within the Miami Marlins continued to grow.  The Marlins now have 17 cases within their traveling party — 15 involving players — and will not play again until Monday at the earliest. The Philadelphia Phillies, who hosted the Marlins for three games last weekend, will not play again until Friday. The Marlins were scheduled to play four games against the Baltimore Orioles this week, and the Phillies were slated to play four against the Yankees. Instead, the Yankees will play the Orioles in Baltimore on Wednesday and Thursday. The Washington Nationals, who were scheduled to play in Miami this weekend, will now be off. The Marlins played the Phillies on Sunday after learning that four players had tested positive. Nine more members of their traveling party were found to have tested positive on Monday, and four more cases were confirmed on Tuesday. The Phillies have not registered any new positives, but were undergoing more tests on Tuesday. The league still hopes to have all teams play 60 games this season. The Phillies and the Marlins could conceivably reach that number by playing doubleheaders or playing on mutual off days. A union representing FedEx pilots called on the delivery company Tuesday to suspend operations in Hong Kong after its members were subjected to quarantine facilities under “extremely difficult conditions.” Hong Kong began testing all airline workers who were previously exempt from mandatory coronavirus tests this month, prompting United Airlines and American Airlines to suspend flights to the city. A FedEx pilot who had arrived from the United States and visited a popular restaurant tested positive on July 11. The Air Line Pilots Association International said on Tuesday that three FedEx pilots who had tested positive for the coronavirus but were asymptomatic were “forced into mandated hospital facilities” in Hong Kong. Those who tested negative but had been in close contact with an infected person “were put into government camps under extremely difficult conditions.” “Pilots who test positive for Covid-19 face compulsory admission and treatment in government-selected public hospitals, with as many as five patients to a room with one shared bathroom,” the union said in a statement. “Not only do these situations pose unacceptable risks to our pilots’ safety and well-being, but they also create added stress and distraction for flight operations,” it added. Hong Kong has had the same quarantining and hospitalization requirements for its own residents who test positive or were in close contact with a confirmed case. The semiautonomous Chinese territory is fighting its biggest surge in coronavirus infections yet, with more than 100 new cases reported in each of the past seven days. Health officials believe that people who had been exempt from mandatory quarantine rules — including airline workers, seafarers and business executives — were behind the spike in cases. Hong Kong previously allowed such exemptions to help boost the economy, but it planned to tighten testing and quarantine arrangements for air and sea crew members starting on Wednesday. Reports about Hong Kong’s quarantine facilities have varied. Some camps have been compared to a “cozy university dorm” with brand-new Ikea furniture, but others have complained about unsanitary and moldy environments. Separately, a 76-year-old woman who was initially hospitalized due to shortness of breath from heart failure died on Wednesday, a hospital spokesman said, bringing the death toll from the virus in Hong Kong to 24. She had been admitted to a hospital cubicle that had confirmed Covid-19 cases, and she was later identified as a close contact and subsequently tested positive. After a weekend outbreak ended a 100-day streak with no reported local transmissions of the coronavirus in Vietnam, officials said on Wednesday that the virus had popped up across the country, with cases discovered in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and two provinces in central Vietnam.  Over the past few days, the Vietnamese health authorities have also confirmed clusters of cases at hospitals in Danang, a central city that is a tourism and trade center. At least 30 cases have been detected there, according to Reuters, and the government shut down flights in and out of the city on Tuesday. Vietnam was lauded for its early and decisive approach to the pandemic, which emerged in China, its northern neighbor. International flights were suspended and schools were closed. Residents wore face masks. A one-party state well equipped to track the local populace focused on comprehensive contact tracing. With fewer than 450 cases of the virus confirmed, Vietnam has not reported a single death from Covid-19. After a 57-year-old man in Danang was confirmed to have tested positive for the virus over the weekend, despite having no history of travel outside the city, the Vietnamese government locked down quickly and unveiled plans to evacuate up to 80,000 domestic tourists, who had traveled to Danang as a sense of normalcy returned to the country. “I am quite worried because the source of this outbreak has not been found,” said Nguyen Thi Minh Hoa, a director of a marketing firm in Danang. “The country must act quickly and decisively.” A Baltimore physician who spent 15 years as chief of the critical care unit at a Baltimore hospital died there of the coronavirus about a month after becoming a patient. About 20 of Dr. Joseph Costa’s co-workers at Mercy Medical Center surrounded him in his final moments on Saturday while his husband held him, The Baltimore Sun reported. Dr. Costa, 56, had worked at Mercy for 23 years. “He showed compassion with his colleagues, no matter the role, the same way he showed compassion to his patients: with grace and dignity,” said Leah Forest, a quality analyst who worked with Dr. Costa. “He was so humble he didn’t want his picture on the wall.” Hospital executives said in a statement that Dr. Costa had “selflessly continued his work on the front lines” as the virus swept into Baltimore and that he had been “deeply committed to serving our patients and our city during this time of great need.” His husband, David Hart, told The Washington Post that when the pandemic hit, he begged Dr. Costa, who had a rare autoimmune disorder, not to go to work, but that Dr. Costa insisted on working alongside his staff.  At least 820 health care workers in the United States have died of the coronavirus, according to a tally compiled by Kaiser Health News and The Guardian. Global ROUNDUP In any other year, Muslims undertaking the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca that observant Muslims are obligated to perform at least once, would drink from a holy well. They would kiss the Kaaba’s sacred black stone as they thronged the Grand Mosque. Before they left Mecca, they would collect pebbles to ritually stone the devil. During the virus edition of the hajj that begins on Wednesday, the black stone is off limits. Authorities in Saudi Arabia are issuing bottled water from the Zamzam well instead of letting pilgrims drink from cups at the source. Also in the pilgrim packages: sterilized pebbles to hurl at the devil, personal prayer rugs and other items intended to prevent an outbreak from marring the hajj. But the chief public health measure the Saudi government has taken is to limit attendance, shrinking one of the world’s most famous crowds to a select few. About 2.5 million Muslims from around the world performed the hajj last year; this year, Saudi Arabia said it would allow just 1,000 pilgrims, all of them from within the kingdom, though it has not released the final number. Across the Middle East, celebrations for Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice that marks the end of the hajj this weekend, will likewise be paler this year. In Oman and Bahrain, where the unchecked spread of the virus among low-paid foreign laborers living in crowded conditions has contributed to two of the world’s worst outbreaks, officials have urged residents to forgo the large celebrations that usually mark Eid, and Oman has reinstituted a domestic travel ban and curfew. In Egypt, new cases have fallen as the country resumes normal life, but a live broadcast will replace communal Eid prayers. In the United Arab Emirates, where it is common for residents to buy sheep or other livestock to sacrifice and donate during Eid, the authorities were encouraging people to use apps to reduce crowding at slaughterhouses and markets. Countries across the region are reopening despite lingering hot spots. While Persian Gulf countries including Oman and Bahrain continue to struggle with large outbreaks, smaller ones in Yemen and Syria — where years of war have decimated health care systems and mired the population in deepening poverty — are rapidly metastasizing. Here are other developments from around the globe: Spain’s prime minister said that Britain had made “an error” by imposing a quarantine on everyone arriving from his country, a decision that blindsided British vacationers and dealt another blow to Spain’s tourism industry. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, in an interview with the news outlet Telecinco on Monday, said that Britain should have taken into account the regional divergences in Spain’s coronavirus cases and not issued a blanket order. Data released by the United Nations World Tourism Organization on Tuesday showed that leisure travel fell by 98 percent during the first five months of the year, compared with 2019. The group said that, globally, 300 million fewer people traveled, representing a loss of $320 billion for the tourism industry. Joran van der Sloot of the Netherlands, who is in prison in Peru for killing Stephany Flores, 21, and who is the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway, has Covid-19, Dutch news outlets report. The prison has four inmates and seven workers with confirmed infections, according to a Peruvian rights group. China recorded 68 new virus infections on Monday, its National Health Commission said on Tuesday, including six in Liaoning Province and 57 in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where a flare-up since mid-July has shown little sign of abating. As China battles the surge, the authorities in the northeastern port city of Dalian, in Liaoning, have said they will test all 6 million residents after an outbreak. Samples have been collected from about 1.68 million Dalian residents as of Sunday night, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, closed all bars and banned the sale of alcoholic drinks in restaurants for 30 days to try to curb the spread of the virus. In a speech Monday, Mr. Kenyatta said recent reopening measures had given “some Kenyans false comfort that this is not a serious health risk to them and their families.” The Venice Film Festival announced the lineup on Tuesday for its 77th edition, setting out precautions including temperature checks and new outdoor screening sites for one of the first large international festivals held since the pandemic began. It will run from Sept. 2 to Sept. 12, with a reduced schedule; 55 to 60 films will be screened, compared with last year’s 80. Aleksandr Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, who is facing an election next month and has been criticized for allowing the coronavirus to spread in his country while he denied and downplayed the danger, said Tuesday at a gathering of security services officers that he had contracted the virus but showed no symptoms. Dubai’s flagship airline, Emirates, says it will provide all passengers with free insurance covering medical expenses up to 150,000 euros (about $175,000), and €100 daily for a 14-day quarantine period, should a passenger be found to have the virus within 31 days of traveling on one of its flights. Should a passenger die from Covid-19, the airline will provide €1,500 toward funeral costs. To qualify, customers must book a ticket before the end of October. U.S. ROUNDUP Across the United States, the number of known infections among state prison inmates and correctional officers has surged by 45 percent since July 1, to more than 80,000, despite limited testing in correctional institutions, according to a New York Times database. Prison deaths related to the coronavirus have risen by nearly 25 percent in that time. The 13 largest known clusters of the virus in the United States, and 87 of the top 100, can be found inside correctional institutions, according to a New York Times database. “They have been checking our temps every day, and the staff are now wearing the white hazmat suits, gloves and masks,” Kayle Smith, an inmate at Wakulla Correctional Institution in Florida, wrote in an email Monday. The number of infected inmates at Wakulla has shot up to 263, from just 15 two weeks ago.  It is not just inmates and guards who have been affected. The director of the Ohio state prison system, Annette Chambers-Smith, has tested positive for the virus, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction announced Monday. Ms. Chambers-Smith has been confronted by one of the nation’s earliest and deadliest prison outbreaks, which has taken the lives of at least 80 inmates.  Public health officials believe the virus is introduced into prisons by correctional officers and other prison employees, and sometimes through inmate transfers from other facilities. Prison outbreaks often correspond with increases in infection in the surrounding communities, according to data collected by The Times. A recent surge of infections at San Quentin State Prison in California, for instance, has occurred along with a sharp rise in surrounding Marin County, where daily infection counts have soared more than 800 percent since June. Nearly three-quarters of the prison’s 3,300 inmates have now tested positive; a month ago, the prison had no known infections. Many of the recent outbreaks have occurred not in major state prisons but in jails in midsize cities, suburbs and rural towns. The Benton County Jail in Arkansas has gone from one case to 229 in recent weeks; the Comanche County Jail in Oklahoma from zero to 179; and the jails in Fresno, Calif., from a handful of cases to more than 640. Elsewhere in the United States: The mayor of Honolulu asked Hawaii’s governor on Tuesday to shut down bars on the island of Oahu for three weeks so that health officials and liquor control officers could develop a stronger enforcement plans to slow the spread of the virus. Kirk Caldwell, the city and county mayor, said he was concerned about bars becoming sources of the virus’ spread after a number of patrons and employees were infected. With virus cases rising steeply in southeastern Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam announced a rollback of the reopening there. The region includes Virginia Beach, the naval bases around Norfolk and Hampton Roads, and tourist attractions like Colonial Williamsburg and Busch Gardens. The governor’s order, effective at midnight Thursday, prohibits the sale and consumption of alcohol after 10 p.m., and requires restaurants to close by midnight. It also limits indoor dining to 50 percent of capacity and social gatherings to 50 people, down from 250. In Montana, officials announced four deaths on Tuesday. The sparsely populated state, where daily case reports have risen recently to an average of about 100, had not previously reported more than three deaths from the virus in a single day. Officials in Arkansas announced 20 new deaths on Tuesday and Oregon announced more than 15 new deaths, both single-day records for those states.  Child care providers in Ohio will be allowed to return to full capacity starting Aug. 9, Gov. Mike DeWine said on Tuesday, though they would forego a state subsidy if they do. Providers who choose to stay at reduced capacity would receive the subsidy, he said. Either way, child care centers would have to keep on performing temperature and symptom checks and comply with other health requirements. The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would extend a $765 million loan to the Eastman Kodak Company to make critical pharmaceutical components, in an effort to reduce American dependence on foreign countries for essential medicines. The arrangement leverages the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that gives the government vast powers and resources to direct certain kinds of production in the interest of national security. Ten residents at a state-run veterans home in Oklahoma died after becoming infected in an outbreak, the executive director of the state’s Department of Veterans Affairs said Tuesday. Since July 1, 52 residents and 21 employees at the Claremore Veterans Center outside Tulsa have tested positive, according to the state, which reported that 36 residents were hospitalized. The outbreak was most likely caused by an asymptomatic employee who unknowingly spread the virus, officials said. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington announced Tuesday that he was extending indefinitely a statewide pause to counties in various stages of reopening, according to The Associated Press. It’s the second time this month that he has extended the pause, and it comes days after he tightened restrictions on indoor activities.  New York Roundup A charity concert Saturday night in the Hamptons that featured performances from the chief executive of Goldman Sachs and the D.J. duo the Chainsmokers drew outrage and a state investigation after video footage showed attendees appearing to ignore health precautions. The concert, called Safe & Sound, was supposed to involve guests sitting outside near their vehicles in spaced-out areas to watch the performances, including one from Jay Schneiderman, the supervisor of the Town of Southampton, where the concert was held. The event generated angry social media posts, and on Monday and Tuesday, criticism from state officials. In a letter on Monday to Mr. Schneiderman, New York’s health commissioner wrote that he was “greatly disturbed” by reports of thousands of people standing close and “generally not adhering to social-distancing guidance.” “We have no tolerance for the illegal & reckless endangerment of public health,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a tweet on Monday night.  At a news conference in Southampton on Tuesday, Mr. Schneiderman said that when his band was performing, nobody was crowded in front of the stage. But he said people were allowed to gather there later, which violated the permit for the event. Elsewhere in the New York area: New York will require travelers from Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., and 34 states to quarantine themselves for 14 days, Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday. The new states added to the list are Illinois, Kentucky and Minnesota. Failure to do so could result in fines up to $10,000.  Connecticut and New Jersey also said travelers from those 36 places were subject to a 14-day quarantine, though compliance is voluntary in New Jersey. In Connecticut, travelers can avoid quarantine if they show documentation that they tested negative within 72 hours of arrival. Otherwise, violators are subject to a $1,000 fine. Many states have added traveler restrictions. In New Jersey, 35 lifeguards from two boroughs on Long Beach Island, a popular summertime destination, recently tested positive, the island’s health department said Monday. Half had mild symptoms and the rest had none, public health officials said; none were hospitalized. The German federal agency in charge of disease control sounded an alarm on Tuesday over a rising number of cases across the nation. Lothar Wieler, the leader of the agency, the Robert Koch Institute, urged Germans for the first time to wear masks outdoors if a distance of 1.5 meters, or about 5 feet, cannot be maintained. Germany reported 633 new cases on Monday, and four deaths. Though Germany’s daily death count has been in the single digits for most of this month, it has seen more than 3,000 new cases over the past week. “The new developments in Germany make me very worried,” Mr. Wieler said, adding, “The rise has to do with the fact that we have become negligent.” When the virus began spreading in March, Germany imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. It was seen as a model for other countries. Since it began reopening, there have been flare-ups that have spurred local lockdowns, including one in June. But on Tuesday, Mr. Wieler said he wondered if this latest uptick was a harbinger of something more. “We don’t know if this is the beginning of a second wave, but of course it could be,” he said. He added, “I am still optimistic that we can prevent this.” Missing social contacts and altered routines can be particularly intense for children with developmental challenges. Disturbed sleep and eating habits, too, can make life more challenging for the children and their families. Here are some strategies to cope better.

British-Australian Academic Jailed in Iran Is Moved to Remote Prison,2020-07-28,By Elian Peltier,"['LONDON — A British-Australian academic serving a 10-year sentence in Iran for espionage has been moved to a remote prison south of Tehran that is said to be riddled with coronavirus cases, according to rights activists, raising further concerns about her deteriorating health. The academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a Cambridge-educated professor in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne, was arrested in 2018 at the Tehran airport as she tried to leave Iran after a conference. Her detention was publicly confirmed a year later by the Australian authorities. Ms. Moore-Gilbert has strongly denounced the charges and maintains her innocence. She was tried in secret and had been detained for the past two years at Evin prison in Tehran, where friends say she was often forced to sleep on the floor and sent to solitary confinement. She was moved on Friday to Qarchak, a notorious and isolated women’s detention facility southeast of the capital, according to Reza Khandan, an Iranian rights activist who said he spoke to Ms. Moore-Gilbert by telephone. “I cannot eat anything,” Ms. Moore-Gilbert said, according to Mr. Khandan, who wrote about the conversation on Facebook. “I don’t know, I’m so disappointed,” he quoted her as saying. “I’m so very depressed.” Dozens of women detained at the Qarchak prison have reportedly been infected with the coronavirus in recent months, according to rights activists and prisoners’ relatives. Inmates at the prison have described a lack of accessible drinking water, inedible meals, overcrowding and insufficient access to medical treatment. The State Department included the prison in a list of entities it deems responsible “for extrajudicial killings, torture or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.” “It is known for unbearable conditions, including regular assaults and inappropriate behavior of prison guards toward women,” the State Department said in a statement released in December. “It’s not a positive sign to move her there,” said Sanam Vakil, a researcher on Iran at Chatham House, an international affairs research institute based in London. “They’re looking to isolate her more, to put more pressure on the Australian government for whatever they’re seeking to obtain,” she added, referring to Ms. Moore-Gilbert. “The big question remains, what do they want?” Iran has imprisoned dozens of foreign academics and dual citizens on espionage or national security charges in recent years, with some of them used as bargaining chips to obtain the repatriation of Iranian citizens detained abroad. A French academic was released in March as part of a prisoner swap. Ms. Moore-Gilbert was at Evin prison for nearly two years along with Fariba Adelkhah, a renowned French-Iranian academic who in May was sentenced to six years in prison on national security charges. A British-Iranian prisoner whose case has made international headlines, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, was also held at Evin, but she was temporarily released in May. It is unusual for foreigners to be incarcerated at Qarchak prison, and the reason for the transfer is unclear. But the move raised new concerns for Ms. Moore-Gilbert’s mental and physical health. Ana-Diamond Aaba Atach, a Finnish-Iranian dual citizen who was imprisoned in Evin for eight months in 2016, speculated that the transfer of Ms. Moore-Gilbert allowed the Iranian authorities to show how they could keep a firm hand on highly publicized cases. “Prisoners describe Evin as a hotel in comparison to Qarchak,” Ms. Aaba Atach said. “And Evin is a horrendous place.” Inmates at Qarchak have said in testimonies collected by the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran that the facility did not have enough toilets or beds, and that some inmates were denied medical treatment based on their alleged crimes. They also said that the food is barely edible, and that they had to buy expensive bottled water because the water they were given was too salty to be drinkable. The coronavirus pandemic has worsened the detention conditions in overcrowded Iranian prisons. Some 85,000 inmates were released in March in an effort to fight the spread of the virus. “Prisons were a huge concern in Iran in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak,” said Ms. Vakil of Chatham House. “Since then, we’re back to not knowing things.” Yet thousands more still behind bars have staged protests in recent months, saying that they are not being protected from the coronavirus. Amnesty International said in April that some 36 prisoners were feared to have been killed by security forces in an effort to control the protests. United Nations experts have urged the Iranian authorities to release more dual citizens like Ms. Moore-Gilbert. In letters smuggled out of Evin in 2019 and published by British news outlets in January, Ms. Moore-Gilbert said she felt “abandoned and forgotten” and described how her health had “deteriorated significantly.” She accused the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which manages the prison ward where she was detained, of “playing an awful game with me.” And she again proclaimed her innocence. “I am not a spy,” she wrote. “I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organization in any country.”']","Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who has denied charges of espionage, is now in a facility where many have been infected with the coronavirus, rights activists say."
"Judge Blocks Green Card Wealth Tests, Citing Pandemic Hardships",2020-07-29,,"['Read our live Coronavirus pandemic coverage here.  A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with plans to deny green cards to immigrants who have received Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers, even on a limited basis — a wealth test that several states, led by New York, sued over during the coronavirus pandemic. The judge, George B. Daniels of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, granted a nationwide temporary injunction, suspending the eligibility requirements that were introduced last year and that drew several legal challenges, including before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in January that the Trump administration could move forward with the plan, but that was before the pandemic. President Trump has sought an expansion of the requirements, but critics argued that they could have a chilling effect for legal immigrants who needed medical treatment or financial aid during the pandemic. Judge Daniels wrote that the policy “fails to measure up to the gravity of this global pandemic that continues to threaten the lives and economic well-being of America’s residents.” “No person should hesitate to seek medical care, nor should they endure punishment or penalty if they seek temporary financial aid as a result of the pandemic’s impact,” he added. Attorney General Letitia James of New York, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday, “This is a major victory to protect the health of our communities across New York and the entire nation.”  It was the latest immigration clash between Democrats and the Trump administration, which was thwarted by the Supreme Court last month from ending a program protecting about 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. This month, the administration walked back a plan to strip visas from international students who took only online classes at universities or colleges. California and Florida on Wednesday reported single-day records for deaths, as a number of other states moved to reimpose restrictions to cope with soaring caseloads. California recorded more than 185 deaths, along with a record number of new cases, more than 12,300, according to a New York Times database.  Florida reported more than 216 deaths, surpassing its previous high of 186, which was recorded on Tuesday.  In Hawaii, which set a  single-day record with 109 new cases, Gov. David Ige said he would seek to limit social gatherings to 10 people after officials noted large gatherings in parks and beaches. He said he was also asking mayors to consider closing bars. “I’m very much concerned with what’s happening,” Mr. Ige said. “It is a dropping of our vigilance.” Rhode Island said it would lower the limit on social gatherings from 25 people to 15 after officials there tracked cases back to a number of large gatherings, including a house party with more than 50 people and a baby shower.  “We are partying too much,” Gov. Gina Raimondo said.  Beginning on Friday, people in Maryland will be required to wear masks in all public buildings, not just in stores and on public transit, as well as  in all places outdoors where social distancing is not possible. In Michigan, officials said they would reduce the number of people who can attend indoor social gatherings to 10 and would close bars for indoor service. Even as the state imposed that restriction, however, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she would allow Detroit’s casinos to open on Aug. 5, though at only 15 percent capacity. A $600-a-week federal unemployment benefit that has helped keep tens of millions of Americans afloat as the pandemic upended the economy is likely to lapse as scheduled on Friday, a top White House official said Wednesday, as the prospects for a quick compromise between Democrats and the Trump administration on a new round of aid sank further. “We’re nowhere close to a deal,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, told reporters after leaving talks with top Democrats in the office of Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. “It means enhanced unemployment insurance provisions will expire.” Democrats want to extend the full benefit through January, while Republicans in the Senate have called for scaling it back to $200 per week. Earlier in the day, President Trump indicated that he did not care about the fate of a broad economic recovery package that lawmakers in both parties, along with members of his own administration, are scrambling to put together before tens of millions of Americans formally lose their jobless benefits on Friday, telling reporters he would rather see a narrow package. “You work on the payments for the people,” Mr. Trump said, referring to another round of direct payments, “and the rest of it — we’re so far apart, we don’t care.” “We really don’t care,” Mr. Trump added. Mr. Trump suggested that he wanted to renew a federal moratorium on evictions that expired earlier this month for millions of Americans, saying, “We want to stop the evictions.” But the Republican proposal his administration helped draft has no measure to do so. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary,  and Mr. Meadows are expected to huddle with Senate Republicans during their weekly policy lunch and meet for the third consecutive day with Ms. Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, later Wednesday afternoon. Democrats have so far rejected the prospect of a narrow package, insisting on a comprehensive package, and Mr. Trump has dismissed the Republican package as “semi-irrelevant.” On Wednesday, he slammed Republicans for distancing themselves from his efforts to secure funding for a new F.B.I. headquarters in Washington as part of the recovery package, saying that, “Republicans should go back to school and learn.” Key Data of the day Back in April, the United States’ leading authority on infectious diseases expressed hope that no more than 60,000 people in the U.S. would die from the virus. A few weeks later a major research center predicted that the figure would be just over 70,000 people by early August. In May, the president said that between 75,000 and 100,000 people might die. On Wednesday, the nation’s death toll surpassed 150,000, according to a New York Times database. That the figure has soared so fast and so far beyond those estimates illustrates how difficult it can be to accurately forecast the spread of the virus, or to predict the way citizens and politicians will respond to it. “The aspect which is really impossible to predict is human behavior,” said Virginia Pitzer, a professor of epidemiology at Yale. “To what extent are people going to socially distance themselves? To what extent are politics going to influence whether you wear a mask? All of these factors are impossible to factor in.” About 1,000 virus-related deaths a day have been reported over the past week, the worst rate since early June, when the number of fatalities seemed to be falling. Now, daily death counts are rising in 23 states and Puerto Rico. The first virus-related death in the U.S. was reported in February. The nation passed the 50,000 mark on April 27 and 100,000 deaths on May 27, a milestone The Times commemorated by filling its front page with names of the dead. As of Wednesday evening, at least 150,909 people were known to have died of the virus in the U.S., out of more than 4.4 million reported infections. And even these figures are likely to be undercounts, experts say. EDUCATION ROUNDUP The Miami-Dade County, Fla., public school system said Wednesday that it would delay the start of the school year by a week to Aug. 31, and that schools would initially open online only. Alberto M. Carvalho, the superintendent, said he hoped to open schools for in-person instruction on Oct. 5 if virus conditions had improved enough by then. Miami-Dade is the latest large school district to opt for remote learning, even as Mr. Trump has pushed for in-person instruction and sought to withhold some federal funding from schools that go online.  Districts in Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix,  suburban Washington and elsewhere have all decided it is not yet safe to return to in-person instruction. The Miami-Dade school district is the fourth largest in the nation and the largest in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has pushed hard for students to attend brick-and-mortar schools next month. A few hours before Mr. Carvalho’s announcement in Miami, Mr. DeSantis visited a school in Clearwater, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, to promote school reopenings. Earlier this month the education commissioner,  Richard Corcoran, issued an emergency order requiring schools to open. After a teachers’ union sued, Mr. DeSantis said districts could delay the start of the school year if needed. Several have done so. “Every parent needs to have a choice about their kid’s education, whether they want to continue with distance learning — I think that’s the parents’ right — or whether they would like that in-person instruction, because I know a lot of students really need that,” Mr. DeSantis said. But Mr. Carvalho said even a hybrid model, with some students going to school and others learning online, would not be feasible with the virus so prevalent in Miami-Dade. Here are other developments in education: Researchers have estimated that the states’ decisions to close schools last spring probably saved tens of thousands of lives and prevented many more infections. Still, the authors acknowledged that their findings are not broadly applicable today, and  experts caution that  the findings highlighted a period when few precautions were in place. A Times survey of every public four-year college in the country, as well as every private institution that competes in Division I sports or is a member of an elite group of research universities, revealed at least 6,300 cases tied to about 270 colleges over the course of the pandemic. And the new academic year has not yet begun at most schools. Alabama said Wednesday that in addition to school employees, students in second grade through college must also wear masks. U.S. Roundup The Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero on Wednesday and pledged to keep supporting the United States economy as the pandemic continues to depress economic growth and sideline millions of workers. “The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,” the central bank said in its post-meeting statement. “The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference following the meeting that the pace of the economic recovery was “far from certain” given the uncertainty surrounding the virus, which has surged in certain spots around the country. While employment ticked up in May and June, recent up-to-date labor market data show signs of slowing as efforts to slow infection weigh on activity again, Mr. Powell said. He also predicted a long slog ahead for workers in certain sectors of the economy, even once the economy reopens more fully, particularly those that involve “lots of people getting together in close proximity” like restaurants, bars, hotels and other places. “There won’t be enough jobs for them,” he said. “There will be a need both for more support from us and for more fiscal policy.”  Here’s a look at other developments around the U.S.: Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said that restaurant employees and patrons would be required to wear masks beginning Monday. He also said that more businesses — including concert venues, theaters, stadiums, arenas and gymnasiums — would be allowed to operate beginning Monday as long as they follow certain restrictions, including limiting capacity to 50 percent of occupancy or 250 people, whichever is less. Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has frequently refused to don a face covering in the Capitol, confirmed on Wednesday that he had tested positive ahead of a planned trip with President Trump on Air Force One. Hours later, Speaker Pelosi  announced a new mandate requiring lawmakers and staff  to wear masks on the House floor, on penalty of removal. Mr. Gohmert has  participated in congressional hearings this week, including Tuesday’s Judiciary Committee session with Attorney General William P. Barr, during which he did not wear a mask.  He said he was not experiencing symptoms.  Florida, which is in the grip of a serious outbreak, announced that all state-supported drive-through and walk-up testing sites would close Thursday at 5 p.m. because a major storm is forecast. Officials noted that tents at the test sites would not be able to withstand tropical storm force winds. Sites are expected to reopen by Wednesday at the latest. In a move long sought by advocates, California has stepped up its efforts to track whether the virus is affecting L.G.B.T.Q. people at disproportionate rates. State health officials announced Tuesday that health care providers and labs would be required to collect and report to the state data that patients give voluntarily about their gender identity and sexual orientation, in addition to their age and ethnicity. GLOBAL ROUNDUP After roughly 100 days without any confirmed cases of local transmission, a coronavirus outbreak has struck Vietnam. And it’s rapidly spreading in the nation of 95 million people. The surge of the virus in the country, which has so far recorded fewer than 450 cases, demonstrates the dangers of the virus even in the places that appeared to have done almost everything right. Japan, China, Australia and South Korea, all of which seemed to have their outbreaks reasonably under control, recorded spikes on Wednesday. The health ministry in Vietnam said that the strain of virus detected in the coastal city of Danang was different from ones that circulated during an earlier round of local transmission, suggesting that virus was imported. Both medical experts and residents are spooked by the surge. “This outbreak is more dangerous than the previous one because it is happening at the same time in many places,” said Nguyen Huy Nga, the dean of public health and nursing at Quang Trung University in Binh Dinh Province. “We do not know the source.” Hours after clusters of cases were confirmed in Danang hospitals this week, officials said they would be shutting the city’s airport. Up to 80,000 local tourists who had traveled to the city would be evacuated, the authorities said. Vietnam is the largest country in the world without a single confirmed death from the virus. Here are other developments from around the globe: A union representing FedEx pilots called on the delivery company on Tuesday to suspend operations in Hong Kong after its members were subjected to quarantine facilities under “extremely difficult conditions.” Ashleigh Barty, the top-ranked women’s singles player, has confirmed that she will not play in the United States Open  in New York because of concerns about traveling during the pandemic. ”I don’t feel comfortable putting my team and I in that position.,” Barty, an Australian, said. The Open is still set to begin on Aug. 31. The last time the tournament was held without the top women’s singles player was 2010, when Serena Williams withdrew because of a foot injury.  Across the Middle East, celebrations for Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice that marks the end of the hajj this weekend, will be tamer this year. About 2.5 million Muslims from around the world performed the pilgrimage to Mecca last year. This year, Saudi Arabia said it would allow as few as 1,000 pilgrims, all from within the kingdom. The agriculture minister of Zimbabwe, Perrance Shiri, who led a military unit that massacred thousands of civilians during civil strife in the 1980s and helped plot the coup that overthrew the country’s longtime strongman leader, Robert Mugabe, in 2017, has died of coronavirus, according to local media reports. Mr. Shiri was 65 (an earlier version misstated his age), and was thought to have contracted the virus from his driver, who also died recently. Australia recorded its deadliest day since the pandemic began, with all 13 fatalities on Wednesday reported from the southern state of Victoria, which also had 723 new cases. A total of 21 new cases were recorded in other states, as the authorities tightened borders and local restrictions. Sending patients from hospitals to nursing homes to free up hospital beds early in the pandemic has been described as “reckless” by lawmakers in Britain, the BBC reports. The death toll in British care homes has been a defining scandal of the pandemic for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Drinkers in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, now must make reservations for seats on patios. The measure was introduced after Dr. Vera Etches, the city’s medical officer of health, expressed concern that a rise in cases among people in their 20s was partly related to long lines outside bars. In its battle to contain the coronavirus, Iran is facing tough decisions on how to proceed with coming marquee academic and religious events: the annual university entrance exam and a holy month of Shia mourning rituals. The university entrance exam, which ranks and matches students with universities and is known as “konkur,” usually takes place in June. But it was delayed because of the virus and millions of recent high school graduates remain in limbo, not knowing if they can attend college  this fall. Commemorating the holy month of Muharram, the first of the Islamic lunar calendar starting on Aug. 20 this year, and Shia Islam’s most important holiday, Ashura, which takes place during that month, has turned into another thorny issue for the government. Every year Iran stages grand religious ceremonies to honor the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad. The event is deeply rooted in Iranian culture and identity. Black banners drape street walls, and every neighborhood hosts nightly prayer gatherings in mosques or people’s homes. Thousands march in street processions and take part in charity food handouts. Health ministry officials sternly oppose holding either event, citing rising numbers of infections and deaths. “We are at the peak of this disease now in most of the provinces and especially Tehran,” said Dr. Minou Mohrez, the health ministry’s top infectious disease specialist and a member of the government’s coronavirus committee. “All public gatherings must be banned to the extent possible.” The government of President Hassan Rouhani, under pressure from religious and educational establishments, has pushed back on the idea of canceling the events, insisting that both will be held with health protocols observed. “We will not allow anyone to question these annual Muharram commemorations and blame them for the surge in Covid-19 cases,” Mr. Rouhani said on Wednesday. The chairman of the House select committee investigating the government’s coronavirus response is accusing the White House of suppressing its own dire state-by-state assessments of the virus’s spread and keeping science-based public health recommendations a secret as Mr. Trump insists the pandemic is under control. The chairman, Representative Jim Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, sent a letter Wednesday to the White House coronavirus task force, demanding that it make its internal assessments public. On Tuesday, The New York Times published the most recent task force report, which identified 21 “red zone” states and offered public health guidance like imposing statewide mask orders or close bars and gyms. (Read the letter to Vice President Mike Pence.) “We are primarily concerned right now with the difference that seems to be existing between what the White House is saying publicly and what it is saying and doing privately,” Mr. Clyburn said in an interview, adding, “Covid-19 is recognized by this White House as being much more serious in their private dealing with it.” Mr. Clyburn also sent letters to the Republican governors of four “red zone” states — Tennessee, Florida, Georgia and Oklahoma — asking them to produce internal correspondence with the administration, as well as proof that they are following the task force’s recommendations. The letter sent to the task force was addressed to Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator. “This unpublished report recommends far stronger public health measures than the Trump administration has called for in public — including requiring face masks, closing bars, and strictly limiting gatherings,” Mr. Clyburn wrote. “Yet many states do not appear to be following these unpublished recommendations and are instead pursuing policies more consistent with the administration’s contradictory public statements.” Mr. Clyburn does not have the power to compel the documents, unless he issues a subpoena — and even then, the Trump White House has ignored such legally binding requests. Mr. Clyburn stopped short of saying he would subpoena the documents, but his committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has broad authority to investigate the government’s response and will hear from three top health officials, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci at a hearing on Friday. Dr. Birx is not scheduled to testify. Only a few weeks into the rollout of New York City’s much-heralded contact-tracing program, which began on June 1 and was a vital initiative in the effort to contain the virus and to reopen the local economy, the newly hired contact tracers were already expressing growing misgivings about their work. The city’s new Test and Trace Corps hired about 3,000 contact tracers, case monitors and others. Some contact tracers described the program’s first six weeks as poorly run and disorganized, leaving them frustrated and fearful that their work would not have much of an impact. They spoke of a confusing training regimen and priorities, and of newly hired supervisors who were unable to provide guidance. They said computer problems had sometimes caused patient records to disappear. And they said their performances were being tracked by call-center-style “adherence scores” that monitor the length of coffee breaks but did not account for how well tracers were building trust with clients. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration acknowledged that the program had gotten off to a troubled start, but said that improvements had been made. “All signs indicate that the program has been effective in helping the city avoid the resurgence we’re seeing in other states,” Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said. Elsewhere in New York: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo estimated on Wednesday that the state would be facing a $30 billion budget shortfall over the next two years — including $14 billion this year — if the federal relief aid bill does not include funding for state governments. He warned of possible 20 percent cuts in funding that would affect state agencies and aid to local governments, schools and hospitals. The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles will allow driving schools, starting on Wednesday, to conduct remote learning for pre-license driving courses, Mr. Cuomo said. Driving schools can hold courses over video chat programs like Zoom and Skype. Talking about money is always difficult, but new financial hardships may be hitting those closest to you, making these conversations all the more important. It doesn’t have to be awkward.

"Spanish Leader Attacks U.K. Quarantine Order, Calling It an ‘Error’",2020-07-28,By Raphael Minder,"['MADRID — Spain’s prime minister said Britain had made “an error” by imposing a quarantine on everyone arriving from his country, a decision that blindsided British holidaymakers and has dealt another serious blow to Spain’s crippled tourism industry. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, in an interview with the news outlet Telecinco on Monday night, also said that Britain should have taken into account the strong regional divergences in the uptick in Spain’s coronavirus cases, rather than instituting a blanket quarantine order. Since the infection rates in some regions of Spain are lower than that in Britain, he argued, it was safer for British tourists to visit those areas than it would have been to stay home. More countries have begun issuing travel warnings for Spain. The German foreign ministry on Tuesday warned against travel to three northeastern regions — Aragón, Catalonia and Navarra — that have all seen upticks in Covid-19 cases. On Monday, the Dutch government urged its citizens to avoid nonessential travel to Barcelona, Spain’s second-largest city and the capital of Catalonia. Simon Clarke, a junior minister in the British government, was quick to defend the quarantine rule. “We don’t agree with that assessment,” Mr. Clarke told Sky on Tuesday in response to Mr. Sánchez’s comments, adding that Britain’s travel advice was guided by science. “Obviously we continue to work very closely with the Spanish authorities and wish them every success in getting this situation under control as quickly as possible.” Spain’s coronavirus caseload has grown significantly in the last week, with 11,000 new infections putting it back among the worst in Europe, after significant improvement between May and June. Many of the new cases are among younger people, who are often asymptomatic, and the new outbreaks have been concentrated in northeastern Spain. Over the weekend, the government had asked Britain to exclude Spain’s two archipelagoes, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands — both major destinations for British tourists, with low Covid-19 caseloads — from its quarantine order. But on Monday, Britain’s foreign office confirmed that both areas would be subject to the quarantine order and advised Britons to avoid all nonessential travel to Spain. Several British news outlets reported that the government was considering reducing the length of quarantine for returnees from Spain to 10 days from 14. Though Spain’s foreign minister said on Sunday that the current outbreaks had been contained, Catalonia’s leader, Quim Torra, warned on Monday that the region faced “a critical situation,” adding that the coming 10 days would determine whether it needed to return to full lockdown. He said Catalonia was now in the same situation as in early March, shortly before Spain declared a monthslong state of emergency. Britain’s weekend quarantine order for Spain followed a similar decision by Norway. But its impact on Spanish tourism is far more significant, given that Spain welcomed more than 18 million British visitors last year. Britons form the largest contingent of tourists in several vacation hot spots, notably on Spain’s islands. The Spanish tourism sector has urged the European Union to step in and align travel rules across the continent to help avoid the chaos of last-minute cancellations triggered by quarantine orders. On Monday, the World Tourism Organization, a United Nations agency based in Madrid, warned that “unilateral actions can cause confusion and produce unnecessary consequences.” ']","Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Britain should not have required all arrivals from Spain to go into quarantine, arguing that his country’s Covid-19 surge has spared some regions."
South Korea Says It Will Launch Spy Satellites as Missile Deal Is Revised,2020-07-28,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean government said on Tuesday that it would begin work on launching its own military surveillance satellites to monitor North Korea, after negotiating a loosening in an agreement with the United States that limits the kind of rockets it is permitted to develop. South Korea and the United States have just finished negotiations to revise their so-called missile guidelines, first signed in 1979, under which Washington maintained tight restrictions on what type of missiles and rockets Seoul could develop, Kim Hyun-jong, a senior national security aide to President Moon Jae-in, said in a news briefing on Tuesday. Mr. Kim denied that the easing of the missile guidelines had been part of negotiations over how much South Korea should pay annually to help cover the cost of keeping 28,500 American troops in the South. President Trump has insisted on a sharp increase from this year’s 1.04 trillion won ($866 million), accusing South Korea of not spending enough for its own defense. Under the revised guidelines, Mr. Kim said, Washington has removed the limit on how powerful solid-fuel rockets South Korea can build to launch space vehicles. Solid-fuel rockets are much easier to store and handle than their liquid-fuel counterparts, making them ideal for missile engines. The lifting of the cap allows South Korea to build powerful rockets with potential applications for long-range ballistic missiles. Seoul remained obliged not to build ballistic missiles with a range of more than 800 kilometers, or 497 miles, Mr. Kim said, but hoped to start launching low-orbit military surveillance satellites using its own solid-fuel rockets within the next several years. “I cannot go into classified military details but I can tell you that we will soon have many low-orbit military satellites with excellent surveillance capabilities monitoring the Korean Peninsula from the sky 24 hours a day,” Mr. Kim said. South Korea has no military satellites of its own, relying instead on United States spy satellites to monitor North Korea. But with Mr. Trump questioning the merit of keeping United States troops in South Korea even as the North’s nuclear and missile capabilities have rapidly expanded, Seoul has struggled to augment its own abilities to counter the North Korean threat. South Korea plans to deploy five military reconnaissance satellites by 2023 at a cost of $1 billion, the national news agency Yonhap reported. On Tuesday, Mr. Kim said that South Korea has lacked “eyes and ears” despite its $41.6 billion defense budget, partly blaming restrictions in the missile guidelines. Under those guidelines, the United States provided South Korea with technical help in building missiles. But it also imposed restrictions on missile developments because of concern over a regional arms race. The guidelines have been revised three times before. In 2012, as the North’s missile threat increased, the United States agreed to let South Korea possess solid-fuel ballistic missiles with a range of up to 497 miles as long as the payload did not exceed 500 kilograms, or about half a ton. In 2017, the United States lifted the payload limit. But South Korea is still banned from developing ballistic missiles with a range of more than 497 miles. South Korea test-launched a new short-range ballistic missile, Hyunmoo-4, in March. The missile had a 497-mile range but was designed to carry a payload of up to two tons, according to South Korean news media.']","Seoul will be able to launch military surveillance satellites to monitor the North after a loosening in an arms agreement with the United States, an aide to the South’s president said."
Mysterious Coronavirus Outbreak Catches Vietnam by Surprise,2020-07-29,By Hannah Beech and Chau Doan,"['In a world plagued by pandemic, Vietnam seemed like a miracle. As months went by without a single recorded coronavirus death, or even a confirmed case of local transmission, residents began leaving their face masks at home. Noodle shops resounded with the clack of chopsticks and sipped broth. Schools opened. And lured by good deals, Vietnamese tourists began taking vacations again, crowding the coastal city of Danang, with its golden beaches and plentiful seafood. But over the weekend, Vietnam, which had gone about 100 days without a single confirmed case of local transmission, announced that the virus was lurking in the country after all — and it was spreading. First, a 57-year-old man from Danang tested positive for the virus and is now on life support. Then clusters quickly emerged in five hospitals. By Wednesday, the virus had spread north to Hanoi, the capital, south to Ho Chi Minh City and afflicted two provinces in central Vietnam, as well as the remote Central Highlands. The surge of the coronavirus in Vietnam, which has so far recorded fewer than 450 cases, revealed the dangers of the virus even in places that appeared to have done most everything right in their battle against contagion. Japan, China, Australia and South Korea, all of which seemed to have their outbreaks reasonably under control, recorded spikes on Wednesday. In the Australian state of Victoria, authorities announced 295 new cases on Wednesday, along with nine new deaths. Hong Kong, which kept its caseload low for months, is now racing against a wave of new infections, sickening about 100 people a day. With infections turning up in nursing homes and restaurants, Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive, warned on Tuesday that Hong Kong was “on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak.” Although Vietnam, a nation of 95 million people, remains the largest country in the world to have not confirmed a single fatality from the coronavirus, the mystery surrounding the infections popping up across the country has spooked medical experts and residents alike. “In my opinion, this outbreak is more dangerous than the previous one because it is happening at the same time in many places,” said Nguyen Huy Nga, the dean of public health and nursing at Quang Trung University in Binh Dinh Province. “We do not know the source of disease, especially with tens of thousands of tourists flocking to Danang.” The Vietnamese authorities have reacted to the latest wave of cases with the kind of fast and forceful response that characterized their actions in the early days of the pandemic. Hours after clusters of cases were confirmed in Danang hospitals earlier this week, officials said they would be shutting the city’s airport. Up to 80,000 local tourists who had flooded the city for a summer break would be evacuated, the authorities said. Since then, several provinces have instituted quarantines for arrivals from Danang, and the dragnet has already turned up positive cases. A waiter at a pizzeria in Hanoi tested positive for the coronavirus after visiting Danang with his family, local news media reported. On Wednesday, the pizzeria was sprayed down with disinfectant by workers in protective gear, according to a video released by local news media. In the Central Highlands, a 21-year-old woman who had been studying in Danang and returned home by car also tested positive. In Danang, a normally bustling city popular with tourists and traders alike, restaurants and bars are closed. Face masks are mandatory again. With holiday swimming in the sea banned by local authorities, the city’s famous beaches were deserted on Wednesday, residents said. “My family and I are not in the area where people are infected but I am very worried,” said Le Thi Thuy Vi, a grocer in Danang. “I decided today that the whole family should stay at home.” As the coronavirus began radiating out from the Chinese city of Wuhan in January, Vietnam, which shares a border and a governing ideology with China but remains wary of its northern neighbor, moved swiftly. The country had learned from previous outbreaks of novel contagions, such as SARS and H1N1 influenza. By late January, Vietnam had shut its schools. A bureaucracy well equipped to track the local populace turned its attention to comprehensive contact tracing. Most Vietnamese, already conditioned to wearing face masks because of air pollution, saw the value in protecting themselves from airborne viral droplets. After a woman returned from the fashion shows in Europe and helped to spread the coronavirus at home, Vietnam stopped nearly all international flights in March, and returning nationals have to undergo quarantine in government facilities. On Wednesday, 120 Vietnamese hydropower workers arrived on a government charter from Equatorial Guinea, where they had contracted the coronavirus. It is the largest contingent of infected returnees to take a government-sponsored repatriation flight, the Vietnamese foreign ministry said. Last week, Vietnam effectively banned the wildlife trade, amid fears that the trafficking of exotic fauna might have precipitated the emergence of the latest outbreak. Vietnam is both a consumer of illegal wildlife products and a transit point of endangered animals destined for China across its shared mountainous border. With no clarity as to the source of the outbreak in Danang, which has infected at least 26 people there, medical authorities were racing to figure out how cases were proliferating in a supposedly closed country. The health ministry said that the strain of virus detected in Danang is different from ones that circulated during the earlier round of local transmission. “This is imported,” said Professor Nga, the public health expert at Quang Trung University. “A virus cannot survive for three months in a community without causing illness.” Professor Nga said he thought the virus likely arrived in Vietnam in late June or early July. In Danang, the police fanned out across the city, trying to locate outsiders who might have brought the virus with them. On Saturday, the police apprehended nine Chinese nationals who had sneaked into Vietnam illegally, local authorities said. Dozens more Chinese who had entered the country illegally were nabbed earlier this month in central Vietnam. A Chinese man, whom the police said had set up an illegal immigration network, was arrested on Monday. The Chinese who were caught were either put in quarantine camps or isolated in hospitals, the police said. Across Vietnam, hospitals were getting beds ready to handle a rise in cases. Professor Nga noted that ventilators and other equipment needed in the fight against the coronavirus are limited in Vietnam. People, he said, had become complacent. “After 100 days with no outbreaks, people weren’t taking precautions anymore,” Professor Nga said. “They weren’t wearing masks or cleaning their hand with soap. People were going to crowded places.” In Danang, Nguyen Thi Minh Hoa, a director of a marketing firm, said that grocery shelves were not being emptied en masse, meaning that residents were anxious but not panicked. Renewed social distancing measures were being followed carefully, she said. “I’m just sad that this coastal city has suddenly become a center of disease after 100 days of peace,” Ms. Hoa said. Hannah Beech reported from Bangkok and Chau Doan from Hanoi, Vietnam.']","After months without a single coronavirus death, or even a confirmed case of local transmission, a new outbreak has struck Vietnam. And it’s spreading."
"Research Boosts Evidence of Masks’ Utility, Some Experts Say",2020-07-27,,"['Read our live Coronavirus Pandemic coverage here.  Researchers have long known that masks can prevent people from spreading airway germs to others. But now experts are pointing to evidence suggesting that masks also protect the people wearing them, lessening the severity of symptoms, or in some instances, staving off infection entirely. Different kinds of masks “block virus to a different degree, but they all block the virus from getting in,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco. If any virus particles do breach these barriers, she said, the disease might still be milder. Dr. Gandhi and her colleagues make this argument in a paper to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. Drawing from animal experiments and observations of various events during the pandemic, they contend that people wearing face coverings will take in fewer coronavirus particles. Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the work, cautioned that the links between masking and milder disease haven’t yet been proved as cause and effect.  Ideas about the importance of viral dose in the development of disease have cropped up in the medical literature since at least the 1930s. More recently, scientists have gone as far as to puff different amounts of a flu virus up the noses of human volunteers. The more virus in this nasal plume, they found, the likelier the participants were to get infected and experience symptoms. That sort of experiment can’t be done ethically for the new coronavirus, given how dangerous it is. But earlier this year, a team of researchers in China tried something similar in hamsters: They housed coronavirus-infected and healthy animals in adjoining cages, some of which were separated by buffers made of surgical masks. Many of the healthy hamsters behind the partitions never got infected. And the unlucky animals who did got less sick than their “maskless” neighbors. Rules around mask wearing have been highly politicized. President Trump spent months questioning their utility and refusing to wear one in public, though he has recently changed course.  Another of summer’s most cherished rites was upended by the pandemic on Monday when the attempted return of Major League Baseball hit a snag, as the Miami Marlins postponed their home opener after 14 members of the team tested positive for the coronavirus. The troubled return of the national pastime, after months of careful planning, was only the latest sign that the virus, instead of ebbing over the summer as officials had once hoped it would, is spreading at record levels across wide sections of the United States. A month that began with canceled July 4 fireworks displays across the country and sporadic beach closures has continued with edicts shutting down the bars of Bourbon Street in New Orleans and the dance floors of Nashville. Now a new round of cancellations — including the Marlins game and a Phillies game in Philadelphia, where the visiting Yankees would have had to use the same clubhouse that the Marlins had — is continuing to disrupt summer life. The infections, and postponements, cast a pall over baseball’s plans to attempt a 60-game season using 30 stadiums, including a ballpark in Buffalo for the Toronto Blue Jays, who were barred from playing home games by the Canadian government because of the risk of travel to and from the United States. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, warned early on about how the pandemic would transform professional sports. He threw out the first pitch at baseball’s opening game last Thursday between the Yankees and Washington Nationals, an image featured on a limited-edition Topps NOW baseball card that Topps said sold 51,512 copies during its 24-hour offering.  Topps said that the demand for the card was more than double the previous record for a Topps NOW card, which was 19,396 copies of a Vladimir Guerrero Jr. card in 2019. There will also be no summer blockbuster at the local movie theater: “Tenet,” the Christopher Nolan thriller that Warner Bros. had hoped would lure fans back to multiplexes this month, has been postponed until Sept. 4, the beginning of Labor Day weekend. The political blockbusters planned for later this summer — the national conventions — will be unrecognizable from in years past. President Trump said last week that he was bowing to the reality of the virus and canceling the convention activities he had tried to move to Jacksonville, Fla., after officials in North Carolina, where they were initially supposed to be held, had insisted on enforcing health guidelines. And Democrats have long been working on a scaled-back convention in Milwaukee where they plan to nominate Joseph R. Biden Jr.  One of the other big television events of the summer — the Olympics — is off, too. Tokyo, where the games were supposed to be underway right now, instead finds itself grappling with record numbers of new cases on several recent days.  Even the unofficial end of summer — the start of the school year — is being postponed in many districts, where officials say that they need more time to prepare for classes, which will be held in person in some places and online in others. President Trump shared on his Twitter account Monday night a viral video containing a series of false or misleading medical claims about the coronavirus, as social media companies scrambled to halt the video’s rapid spread. Facebook and YouTube removed versions of the video, and Twitter later removed the post shared by the president. At least one version, which was shared on Facebook by the right-wing Breitbart news site, had garnered over 13 million views before it was removed. Other versions of the video, including shorter, edited clips, were still online Monday night.   The video featured what appeared to be a group of doctors in white coats, standing in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., in what appeared to be a news conference. The doctors made a series of misleading claims, including that hydroxychloroquine could be taken as a preventive measure.  The use of the drug to treat or prevent coronavirus has been widely disputed by the medical establishment. The Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency authorization in June after deeming it “unlikely to be effective” while carrying potential risks, and the National Institutes of Health halted clinical trials of the drug in June. But Mr. Trump repeatedly boosted the drug in the early months of the crisis, and said in June he was taking it himself.   It was the most recent example of misinformation that has spread about the coronavirus, at times being shared by Mr. Trump and others in the White House. A YouTube spokesman said in a statement that the video had been removed for “violating Covid-19 misinformation policies.” Republicans are seeking a $400-per-week reduction in unemployment benefits in their $1 trillion economic recovery package, initially lowering the extra federal payments for tens of millions of jobless Americans from $600 to $200, according to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. The proposal to slash the jobless aid by two-thirds, part of a Republican plan they began rolling out on Monday afternoon, is likely to be among the most bitterly contested issues in bipartisan negotiations over the next round of pandemic relief. Democrats support a $3 trillion package that includes extending the $600-per-week federal payments, which expire on Friday, through the end of the year. Many Republicans detest the supplement to state jobless aid, put in place by the $2.2 trillion stimulus law, arguing that it is a disincentive to returning to work because it exceeds what some workers can earn in regular wages. The Republican proposal, which has badly divided the party, envisions eventually shifting to a new system of calculating benefits that would cap payments at about 70 percent of a worker’s prior income, which would also amount to about $200 per week. It also proposes another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans. In a nod to the long odds of striking a deal before the benefits expire on Friday, administration officials continue to float the prospect of speeding through a much narrower bill that would extend extra jobless aid, provide funding for schools and enact new liability shields for operating businesses. But Democrats have rejected that idea, saying it would sap momentum for other crucial relief measures. Democratic leaders left a nearly two-hour meeting with White House officials on Monday evening saying they were unsatisfied with the opening bid Republicans had put forward and all but taunting their Senate counterparts for struggling to coalesce around a proposal. “If they’re not even getting to the fundamentals of food and rent and economic survival, they’re not really ready to have a serious negotiation,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said after nearly two hours of meeting with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff; and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. Mr. Schumer added, “We hope they can get their act together — we very much want to get something done for the needs of the people.” Mr. Meadows, as he left Ms. Pelosi’s office with Mr. Mnuchin, declared it a good meeting and said the pair would return on Tuesday. Both Democratic leaders said they planned to carefully review the Republican offer overnight. Even as the virus rages across much of the nation, forcing many states to slow or reverse their reopenings, President Trump said on Monday that more states should be opening up. During a visit to a North Carolina biotechnology lab, Mr. Trump boasted that progress toward a vaccine was “substantially ahead of schedule” and that a breakthrough would lead to a “tremendous” economic recovery.  In the next breath, Mr. Trump complained that “a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening, and we’ll see what happens with them.” It was something of a return to form for Mr. Trump, who has long pressed states to reopen, downplaying the threat of the virus, but who had seemed to shift last week when he declared at the White House that the virus “will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.” But on Monday, Mr. Trump also urged Americans to “especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wears masks when appropriate.” And he then donned a mask himself for a subsequent tour of the lab facility, where researchers are making components for a potential vaccine. Mr. Trump spoke after the White House announced that his national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, had tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the most senior White House official known to have contracted the virus. In a statement, the White House said that Mr. O’Brien “has mild symptoms” and is working remotely from “a secure location off site.” Mr. O’Brien typically works from a West Wing office that is steps away from the Oval Office. It is unclear when he was last in contact with Mr. Trump, although he joined him on a July 10 trip to Florida. A photo of Mr. O’Brien taken after he left the plane in Miami shows him without a mask. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, made it clear during a visit to Tennessee on Monday that she believed that everyone in the state should be required to wear masks — but she stopped short of publicly asking its governor to issue a statewide mandate. “We need 100 percent of the counties, including the rural counties, to have these mandates,” Dr. Birx said during a news conference. Then the state’s governor, Bill Lee, a Republican, took to the lectern and was asked if Dr. Birx had pressed him to issue a statewide mandate. “We talked about statewide mandates. We also talked about alternative approaches,” he said. Tennessee reported 2,871 new cases on Sunday, the most it has reported in a single day, according to a New York Times database. It was another example of how the nation’s patchwork of rules and recommendations at different levels of government has complicated efforts to control the virus. Federal health officials issue guidelines and make recommendations, but state and local officials do not always follow them. Mr. Trump has been dismissive of or slow to promote some federal recommendations — it took weeks for him to appear in a mask after health experts called for face coverings — and suggested on Monday that more governors should reopen.   As Kentucky officials weighed new restrictions, Dr. Birx said over the weekend that the leaders of nearby states should consider doing the same by closing bars again and issuing restrictions on public gatherings “to really make it possible to control the pandemic before it gets worse.” Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said Monday that the state’s bars would have to close again to slow the spread, about a month after they had reopened.  He also reduced the legal restaurant capacity from 50 percent to 25 percent, and issued an informal recommendation that schools wait until the third week of August to resume in-person classes. Kentucky had already implemented two other recommendations put forward by Dr. Birx: requiring face masks for public indoor spaces, and limiting social gatherings to 10 people. “I don’t want to be a state where casket makers are running out,” Mr. Beshear said. States in the South and Midwest are facing the prospect of shutting down parts of their economies again to try to stem the virus, which the Trump administration and many governors have increasingly been forced to recognize as unrelenting. Florida has surpassed New York, an early center of the pandemic in the United States when testing was scarce, in the number of known cases. And on Monday, Oklahoma and New Mexico broke state records for single-day cases. Texas became the fourth state to record over 400,000 total cases, after California, Florida and New York. And despite increased testing capacity across the nation, there is a consensus among federal state and local officials that test results are taking too long. Britain will crack down on junk food advertising and introduce calorie counts on menus in an effort to tackle obesity and ease the pressure on the country’s National Health Service amid the coronavirus pandemic, the government said on Monday. For the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the intersection of obesity and the coronavirus is personal. Mr. Johnson was, by his own admission, “way overweight” when he was admitted to the hospital after becoming ill with Covid-19 this year, and his health deteriorated to such an extent that at one point he needed intensive care. Studies have linked obesity to a greater risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19, and Mr. Johnson, writing in the British newspaper The Daily Express, described his time in hospital as a “wake-up call.” “We all put things off — I know I have,” Mr. Johnson wrote. “I’ve wanted to lose weight for ages and like many people I struggle with my weight.” As part of the government’s new obesity strategy, advertisements for any food high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned on television and online until 9 p.m. to avoid hours when children are most likely to see them. There will also be a consultation on whether Britain should entirely ban online ads for junk food. All large restaurants and cafes will be required to add a calorie count to their menus, and the government will look into adding calorie labels to alcoholic drinks. Promotional offers like “buy one, get one free” on fatty or sugary foods will also be prohibited. Instead of the welcome that a tourism-hungry island would usually extend, travelers to Puerto Rico over the weekend encountered angry protesters outside the San Juan airport, demanding that the airport be closed to tourists. The protesters’ complaint: Too many visitors have been blithely ignoring social-distancing precautions and mask mandates. A caravan of cars honking their horns, with protesters holding up signs, blocked traffic into the airport, and some protesters on foot clashed with police. “We are going to continue with this caravan and with this fight, because this is a question of life or death,” one protester, Ricardo Santos Ortiz, said on WAPA-TV Saturday. Puerto Rico reopened to tourism July 15, but a day later Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced reversed course, pushing the opening off for a month and shutting many businesses down again, because coronavirus cases were soaring on the island. That has not stopped tourists from arriving anyway, often flying in from virus hot spots around the U.S. to vacation in one of the few tropical getaways that Americans can visit now. About 12,000 people have flown to San Juan from Miami so far in July, five times as many as in April, according to Greg Chin, a spokesperson for Miami International Airport. José Reyes of the Puerto Rico National Guard said in a televised interview last week that only about 20 percent of arriving visitors were complying with Puerto Rico’s requirement that they have a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours. Puerto Rico shut down early, before any U.S. state, and managed to avoid a major coronavirus outbreak in the spring. But its daily case counts have soared in the last two weeks, and residents say the influx of tourists is to blame for much of the rise. Videos of unmasked tourists dancing in the streets and scuffling at the airport have recently gone viral, and some businesses have called the police to deal with tourists who became aggressive when asked to wear a mask. Though the island’s hotels are open, much else is shut down, including hotel swimming pools, casinos and tourist attractions; beaches are closed except for solo exercise. One of the first large studies of safety and effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine in the United States began on Monday, according to the National Institutes of Health and the biotech company Moderna, which collaborated to develop the vaccine. The first shot was given to a person at 6:45 a.m., Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infections disease expert, told reporters. The study, a Phase 3 clinical trial, will enroll 30,000 healthy people at about 89 sites around the country. Half will receive two shots of the vaccine, 28 days apart, and half will receive two shots of a saltwater placebo. Neither the volunteers nor the medical staff giving the injections will know who is getting the real vaccine. Dr. Fauci estimated that the trial’s full enrollment of 30,000 will be completed by the end of the summer, and that results might be available by November. Even earlier results might be possible, he said, but added that he doubted that would be the case. A second company, Pfizer, announced Monday afternoon that it would also begin a late-stage study of a coronavirus vaccine, on Tuesday. Pfizer has been working with a German company, BioNTech. Their study will also include 30,000 people, from 39 states in the United States, and from Brazil, Argentina and Germany. The government announced last week that it had reached a $1.95 billion deal to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine by the year’s end, but only if the trial proves it safe and effective. At the news briefing, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said that at least three other Phase 3 trials would be starting soon, each needing 30,000 patients. Those trials will involve vaccines made by Novavax, by a collaboration of the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, and by Johnson & Johnson. All are part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed.  Once volunteers are vaccinated, researchers will be looking for side effects and waiting to see if the vaccine significantly lowers cases of Covid-19. The study will also try to find out if it can prevent severe Covid-19 cases and death; if it can prevent infection entirely, based on lab tests; and if just one shot can prevent the illness. Earlier tests of the vaccine showed that it stimulated a strong immune response, with minor and transient side effects like sore arms, fatigue, achiness and fever. But exactly what type of immune response is needed to prevent the illness is not known, so Phase 3 studies are essential to determine whether a vaccine really works. Long Beach Island, a popular summertime destination along the Jersey Shore, is now a different kind of hot spot. Thirty-five lifeguards from two boroughs on the barrier island — Surf City and Harvey Cedars — recently tested positive for the coronavirus, the island’s health department announced on Monday. Public health officials said that half of the lifeguards were experiencing mild symptoms and the rest were asymptomatic. None were hospitalized, the officials said. The outbreak was traced to two social gatherings that the lifeguards attended on July 12 and July 14, according to the Long Beach Island Health Department, which said it dispatched nurses to investigate cases and issue quarantine orders.  “Based on our investigation so far, the workplace was not the source of transmission and practices likely prevented additional cases,” the Health Department said in a news release on Monday. “The youth and young adults should recognize they are not immune to this virus.” During a daily briefing on the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey mentioned the outbreak on Long Beach Island and said he was troubled by reports of large social gatherings of young people. “This is among us, folks,” Mr. Murphy said. “Any of us who thinks we can just put our feet up and relax and let this take its course is not paying attention, particularly congregating inside, in close proximity, poor ventilation, without face coverings. You’re looking for trouble. You’re absolutely looking for trouble, no matter how old you are.” In Harvey Cedars, 18 of 73 lifeguards were infected, according to the borough’s website, which said that its beaches were still open and fully staffed. The lifeguards who tested positive for the virus will not be allowed to return to work until they meet the safety protocols set by the island’s health department, according to a post on the borough’s website. It was not immediately clear what those protocols are. When reached by phone on Monday evening, the mayor of Surf City, Francis R. Hodgson Sr., refused to comment.  On Long Beach Island, only one lifeguard is allowed in a lifeguard stand under social distancing guidelines that the island’s Health Department said it implemented at the start of the season. Lifeguards must report directly to their stand, and communal activities are barred, health officials said. The doctor who supplied the data for two discredited Covid-19 studies had a history of cutting corners and misrepresenting information as he pursued his ambitions, former colleagues say. In May, Dr. Sapan Desai published two high-profile studies, including one that found that anti-malaria drugs promoted by President Trump had harmed patients being treated for Covid-19. The study almost instantly disrupted multiple clinical trials amid the pandemic. (The Food and Drug Administration said that hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to be safe and effective and should not be used outside clinical trials.) Last month, both studies were retracted by the medical journals that had published them, after researchers around the world suggested the data was dubious. Dr. Desai, who declined to share the raw data even with his co-authors, claimed it was culled from a massive trove acquired by Surgisphere, a business he started during his residency. The New York Times interviewed more than two dozen people who have known Dr. Desai over the past two decades. He has cast himself as an ambitious physician, an entrepreneur with an M.B.A. and a prolific researcher published in medical journals. But more than a dozen doctors who worked with him during training and residency said they had often found him to be an unreliable physician, who seemed less interested in patient care than in his company and a medical journal he founded. “You couldn’t trust what he said,” said Dr. Vanessa Olcese, a former chief resident who worked with Dr. Desai at Duke University Medical Center. U.S. ROUNDUP Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told employees Monday that they would not be expected back in the office until mid-2021. The company’s work force, which has been working remotely since March, had previously been told to expect a return to offices in January 2021. A Google spokesman said: “To give employees the ability to plan ahead, we are extending our global voluntary work from home option through June 30, 2021, for roles that don’t need to be in the office.” Technology companies moved quickly with work-from-home policies, and have been reluctant to bring workers back too early. In May, Facebook said it would allow many employees to work from home permanently. In other developments around the United States: Washington, D.C., said travelers should quarantine themselves for 14 days if they arrive from 27 “high-risk” states that meet certain criteria, including California, Florida and Texas. Residents in nearby Maryland and Virginia — which are both seeing increased numbers of cases — are exempted from the order. People arriving after essential travel in those states or arriving in Washington for essential travel should self-monitor. Many states across the United States have added restrictions on incoming travelers in hopes of curbing the spread of the virus. The Labor Department has been struggling to process a pileup of compensation claims from federal workers who have fallen ill with the coronavirus, according to an audit by the department’s inspector general. The department expects to have received roughly 6,000 claims by next Tuesday, and has been slow to sift through the ones it has received already, according to the report: As of June 16, the department had processed only 911 of the 2,866 claims it had received. Twenty-three states are going ahead with in-person bar exams — the grueling tests that aspiring lawyers must pass to practice — on Tuesday and Wednesday, despite the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the country. Most of the states are in the South or Midwest; many, like Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma, have seen sharp recent rises in case reports. The danger posed by having numerous test-takers sitting in the same rooms for hours has prompted many other states to postpone the exam until later in the year, switch to administering it online, or both. Some states that usually give the exam in early September have also announced postponements. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a $52 million grant from the federal government aimed at slowing the virus’s rampage through the states’s Central Valley, where residents of predominantly Latino communities have consistently been required to keep showing up at work in fields or meatpacking plants and warehouses. The money will go toward more focused testing efforts to identify outbreaks, education for employees and employers about rights to sick leave and other safety issues, as well as improvements to quarantine and isolation protocols. State officials in Texas changed their methodology for reporting coronavirus deaths on Monday, causing a spike in their data. More than 6,000 people in Texas are now known to have died from the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database that uses state and county data, an increase of more than 1,000 since Sunday. The gym chain Planet Fitness announced Monday that guests would be required to wear masks at all times while inside its facilities, effective Aug. 1. The announcement follows similar policies by national chains in recent weeks. Planet Fitness opened its 2,000th gym in December 2019. George Washington University announced on Monday that all undergraduate classes would be taught online this fall as the number of cases rises in Washington, D.C.,  Maryland and Virginia. The university said it would provide on-campus housing to a limited number of students with extenuating personal or academic circumstances. (An earlier version of this briefing reported erroneously that Georgetown University would also be holding all classes online.) The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference said it would cancel fall sports competition because of virus concerns, including men’s and women’s soccer, women’s volleyball, and men’s and women’s cross country. It joined the Ivy League and the Patriot League in placing sports on hold. The surge in coronavirus infections in Missouri has temporarily shut down Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis, less than a month before the fall semester was set to begin, because of a cluster of reported infections among campus employees. The historically black university conducted all its summer classes online this year, so there were few students and faculty members on the campus. But a smattering of other university employees have been working there since May, and the city of St. Louis and the surrounding county have been reporting high rates of infection. Across France, thousands of winemakers, famous and obscure, are facing moments of heartbreak. The economic crisis, combined with the Trump administration’s 25 percent tax on French wines in a trade war dispute with Europe, has collapsed the wine market. So some of the wine for which France is famous will wind up as hand sanitizer. The 2020 harvest, blessed by abundant sunshine, is barely a month away. The wine vats must be emptied for the new production. The distillery is the only option. “We’re producing more than we can sell,” said Thibaut Specht, a winemaker in Alsace. “We have no choice.” Marion Borès’s family business, Domaine Borès, in Reichsfeld, is sending off half its production — 320,000 liters — to a distiller for conversion into alcohol for sanitizer. “It’s like you are saying goodbye to somebody who is very dear to you,” she said. GLOBAL ROUNDUP After North Korea on Sunday accused a man of secretly crossing into the country from South Korea and bringing the virus with him, Seoul went in search of any defectors \u200bin \u200bthe South who were missing. By Monday, South Korean officials had zeroed in on a 24-year-old man, identified only by his family name, Kim, who in 2017 swam across the western inter-Korea border to defect to the South. On July 19, he swam back across the border into Kaesong in the North, they said. It was not immediately clear why the defector had crossed. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the man had been wanted by the South Korean police for questioning after a rape accusation. North Korea said on Sunday that the North Korean man was “suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus” and could be the country’s first case. And the reverse defection prompted the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to order a total lockdown of Kaesong, a border city of 300,000, and declare a “maximum” national emergency. Until Sunday, North Korea had \u200brepeatedly \u200bsaid that it had no Covid-19 cases. The claim was questioned by outside experts. South Korea officials could not say whether the man might have \u200bcarried the virus across the border. In other news from around the world: Vietnam, which on Saturday broke a streak of 100 days without a local virus transmission, will evacuate 80,000 people from the central city of Danang after four residents there tested positive this weekend. Hong Kong will prohibit dining in restaurants, limit public gatherings to two people and require mask-wearing in public at all times, officials said on Monday, reacting to a spike in coronavirus cases. The territory reported 145 cases on Monday, its highest single-day count since the pandemic began. Belgium’s prime minister reinstated strict social-distancing rules on Monday, saying she was taking aggressive steps to avoid another lockdown. She ordered Belgians not to socialize with more than five people and restricted all shopping visits to 30 minutes. Such measures were in place this spring, as Belgium was just emerging from a strict lockdown. Belgium’s infection numbers remain small but are increasing quickly, particularly in the second-largest city, Antwerp. Lebanon on Monday ordered bars, houses of worship, cinemas, sporting events and markets to close for two weeks as part of a lockdown after a surge in infections, Reuters reported, citing state media accounts. Some shops, banks and schools will be allowed to open, but only for two days a week. The virus has been surging across Zambia, with the government announcing a record number of cases. Last week, the authorities also said that 15 lawmakers and 11 members of staff had tested positive. The Australian Open, the premier golf tournament on the PGA Australasia Tour, won’t be played this year because of the pandemic, Golf Australia announced. The event, which is in its 105th year, had been scheduled for November. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said Monday that the coronavirus was “easily the most severe” global health emergency that the organization has declared. He defended how the W.H.O. has handled it from critics including Mr. Trump, who have accused it of being slow to sound the alarm, and added that the pandemic “has shown what humans are capable of, both positively and negatively.” Reporting was contributed by Julie Bosman, Stephen Castle, Troy Closson, Emily Cochrane, Lindsey Rogers Cook, Michael Cooper, Michael Crowley, Nicholas Fandos, Julia Echikson, Sheera Frenkel, Gillian Friedman, Ellen Gabler, Kevin Granville, Denise Grady, Rebecca Halleck, Shawn Hubler, Choe Sang-Hun, Tyler Kepner, Patrick J.

North Korea Thinks He Brought Covid-19. The South Wanted to Arrest Him.,2020-07-28,By Choe Sang-Hun,"['SEOUL, South Korea — Three years ago, out of work\u200b and hungry, Kim Geum-hyok climbed Mount White Horse near his North Korean hometown, Kaesong, brooding on the meaninglessness of life. Not far\u200b to the south\u200b, across a river, the 21-year-old could see high-rise buildings in South Korea, dazzlingly lit up. The sight beckoned him. After two nights on the mountain, Mr. Kim crossed the world’s most heavily armed border to get to it. He climbed down, crawled under and over layers of barbed-wire fences and made his way through minefields. At the river’s edge, he hid among reeds, improvising a life jacket from washed-up plastic trash. When night fell, he began to swim. “I kept swimming toward the light,” Mr. Kim said of his seven and a half hours in the water, in an interview that a fellow North Korean defector posted on YouTube. “When I finally landed on the South Korean side and walked through reeds and saw South Korean soldiers approaching, I was so exhausted I collapsed.” This month, after three years of life in the South, Mr. Kim went back — swimming across the same river he’d crossed in 2017, South Korean officials said. On Sunday, North Korea said he may have brought the coronavirus into the country for the first time, and it put Kaesong, Mr. Kim’s hometown, under lockdown. On Monday, a police department in South Korea said that before Mr. Kim left, a warrant had been issued for his arrest on a rape accusation. North Korea did not identify Mr. Kim in its statement. But South Korea said he was the only defector in the South who had gone back to the North this month. The South did not disclose his full name, but it released enough information for reporters to establish his identity. And other defectors who knew him — including the YouTube interviewer, Kim Jin-ah, a woman from Kaesong — confirmed that it was him, uploading photos of Mr. Kim to social media. Weeks before his departure, \u200bMr. Kim, now 24, gave several interviews for Kim Jin-ah’s YouTube channel, Lady From Kaesong, \u200btalking about his lives in the \u200btwo Koreas. He used an alias\u200b and wore sunglasses, and in some clips his face had been digitally altered. Much of what he said could not be independently verified. “I once visited his apartment in late June and I was surprised that it was so bare of furniture,” Ms. Kim said in a video posted after Mr. Kim’s return to the North. “Looking back, I think he was already preparing to leave South Korea.”  Even before Mr. Kim went back, his story was an unusual one. Most of the 33,000 North Korean defectors now living in South Korea got there by way of China and Southeast Asia. But some, like Mr. Kim, made the dangerous decision to cross the inter-Korean border. For a defector to return, however — to a desolate economy and a dictatorship that calls defectors “human scum” — is rare. Eleven have done so in the last five years, according to the South’s Unification Ministry.  Like many defectors, those who go back have often had trouble adjusting to the South’s freewheeling capitalist society. In one of the YouTube interviews, Mr. Kim said he had lost most of his hearing at an early age. “Because of that, I had difficulty communicating with people,” he said. “I was \u200bbeaten because I was told to bring one thing and brought some\u200bthing else.”  When he was still a child, Kaesong, a city of 300,000, was chosen as the site of an industrial park run jointly by the two Koreas. It opened in 2004, and Kaesong became a boomtown, awash with cash. Mr. Kim’s cousins worked at the park, he said, and he himself \u200bsold eggs and vegetables.   But four years ago, the South \u200bshut down\u200b the complex \u200bin a dispute \u200bover the North’s nuclear weapons program. The economy crashed, and Mr. Kim, like many others, was soon out of work. (Last month, with inter-Korean relations at another low, the North blew up an office in Kaesong that it had jointly operated with the South.)  By the time he climbed Mount White Horse in June of 2017, Mr. Kim \u200btold Ms. Kim, he “saw no hope for the future, no meaning in life, wondering \u200bwhether I should continue to live or die.” Seeing the South Korean buildings at night compelled him to “go there and check it out even if that meant my death,” he said. Mr. Kim said he could not take his eyes off South Korean television during his debriefing by officials, which all defectors undergo after arriving in the South. In the North, all TV sets are preset to government propaganda channels. Mr. Kim settled in Gimpo, a city across the Han River from Kaesong. \u200bA doctor corrected the hearing problem that he had lived with since childhood.  He gave Ms. Kim no details about his condition or the treatment, but he told her that he cried that day. He also told her that he missed his parents deeply. He had enrolled in a vocational school, as part of the resettlement program that the South offers to defectors. But he said he quit and found work, hoping to send money to his family, as defectors often do through middlemen in China.  Off camera, according to Ms. Kim, Mr. Kim confided something else.  He told her that he was being investigated by the police because another defector had accused him of raping her. He told Ms. Kim that he had been so drunk on the night in question that he couldn’t remember anything. With Mr. Kim now in the North, it is impossible to contact him for comment. But the police in Gimpo confirmed that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. On July 17, officials say, Mr. Kim arrived on Ganghwa Island, which may have been where he first set foot on South Korean soil. At 2:20 a.m. on the 18th, he got out of a taxi on the island’s northern shore. Around that time, he sent his last text message to Ms. Kim. “I really didn’t want to lose you because you were like a big sister to me,” he wrote, according to Ms. Kim, who read the message on YouTube\u200b. “I will repay my debt \u200bto you \u200bno matter where I live, as long as I live.” Ms. Kim, who was working at a 24-hour convenience store when the message arrived, rushed to Mr. Kim’s apartment as soon as her shift ended, she told her viewers.   She learned that he had given up the apartment days earlier, reclaiming his deposit. She said he had also sold a used car he had borrowed from her, apparently to raise as much money as he could before going home. South Korean officials concluded that Mr. Kim had crossed by crawling through a drain, three feet in diameter, that runs underneath barbed-wire fences \u200bon Ganghwa’s north shore. That led him to the Han River, which they believe he swam back across. In a bag near the drain, officials found bank receipts indicating that Mr. Kim had withdrawn 5 million South Korean won \u200bfrom his account, then converted most of that to $4,000. What happened to Mr. Kim after he crossed is unknown. North Korea said Sunday that he was in quarantine, accusing him of creating “the dangerous situation in Kaesong City that may lead to a deadly and destructive disaster\u200b.”']","Kim Geum-hyok, the defector who swam back to the North — leading to a coronavirus lockdown — was wanted in South Korea, where he had been accused of rape.

"Taliban Executes Female Prison Guard, and U.N. Raises Concern Over Afghan Violence",2020-07-27,By Mujib Mashal and Najim Rahim,"['KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban abducted and executed a female prison guard in the eastern Afghan province of Ghazni, officials and relatives said Monday, as the United Nations expressed concern over the war’s unending toll on civilians. Fatima Rajabi, 23, who had trained as a police officer, was pulled out of a civilian minibus on her way to her home village in the Jaghori district two weeks ago. After holding her captive for two weeks, the Taliban executed the young woman and sent her body to her family, her brother, Samiullah Rajabi, said. “My sister was shot eight times,” Mr. Rajabi said. “When we opened the coffin, her hands were behind her, together and stiff — you could tell her hands were first tied and they had only untied them after they sent the body.” The United Nations, in a report released on Monday on civilian harm in the Afghan conflict in the first six months of the year, expressed particular concern about the rise of abductions and executions by the Taliban. There has been an increase of more than a fivefold in civilian casualties tied to abductions since last year, it said. Nearly 1,300 civilians have been killed and close 2,200 others wounded in the first six months of the year, according to the United Nations, which attributed 43 percent of the civilian casualties to the Taliban and 23 percent to Afghan forces. It said the insurgent violence had grown deadlier, with a 33 percent increase in deaths caused by the Taliban over the same time period last year. Women and children made up about 40 percent of the overall dead and injured, with pro-government forces responsible for the death of more children than the Taliban, the United Nations said. Civilian casualties from airstrikes by Afghan forces tripled from the first half of 2019. “The reality remains that Afghanistan continues to be one of the deadliest conflicts in the world for civilians,” the report noted. “Each year, thousands of civilians are killed and injured, abducted, displaced and threatened by parties to the conflict in Afghanistan.” The numbers still marked an overall 13 percent reduction in civilian casualties — which accounts for injuries and deaths — from the same period last year. That is largely attributed to a major drop in casualties from United State airstrikes and attacks by the Islamic State branch in the country, which has shrunk significantly after major military operations. As part of a withdrawal deal signed with the Taliban in February, the United States is no longer deploying its air power against the group except in extreme cases, such as when their Afghan allies are being routed. Although the United States has reduced its troops in the country to about 8,600 — it is on schedule to complete a full withdrawal over a 14-month period laid out in the agreement — other elements of the peace agreement, mainly direct negotiations between the Afghan sides over future power-sharing, have stalled as the violence continues. “At a time when the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban have a historic opportunity to come together at the negotiating table for peace talks, the tragic reality is that the fighting continues inflicting terrible harm to civilians every day,” said Deborah Lyons, the U.N. secretary-general’s special representative for Afghanistan. Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States’ special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, has begun another trip to meet with the Taliban’s negotiating team, based in Doha, and Afghan leaders in Kabul and push for direct negotiations, the State Department said. Those negotiations were expected to begin in March, but were delayed by disagreements over a prisoner swap under which the Afghan government was expected to free 5,000 Taliban fighters in return for 1,000 of its forces. Jaghori, where Ms. Rajabi was traveling to see her family at the time of her abduction, was long considered one of the safest districts in a volatile region inhabited by the Hazara ethnic group. But in 2018, the Taliban launched an assault on the area and nearly took control, before being pushed back. The insurgents have increasingly threatened the highways and main roads across Afghanistan, taxing commercial vehicles and searching buses for anyone suspected of working for the government. Mr. Rajabi said his sister would often travel home unannounced to reduce the risk of being detained. Her family found out she was taken by the Taliban only after five days had passed. Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, denied that the group was behind the execution. But local officials said the Taliban had been using Ms. Rajabi to pressure local leaders into resolving certain outstanding issues, possibly including taxes that the Taliban believe they are owed. “The Taliban were angry that despite repeated notices, the leaders hadn’t reported to them,” said Mohamad Ayub Bahonar, the district governor of Jaghori. Ms. Rajabi’s 70-year mother, Mariam Akbari, traveled to the Taliban-held area to beg for her daughter’s release. The Taliban told her she must bring 15 district leaders who they wanted to talk to — something that was out of her power, she said. “I went and begged, I lowered myself at their feet, so my sweet daughter could come back to me alive,” Ms. Akbari said. “They told me ‘You are old, we respect you, but don’t come again.’” Ms. Akbari had already lost one son, a police officer, to the war about ten years ago. One of her two remaining sons lives with her and has a heart condition, and the other has lived in Iran for years without much contact with the family. “I really loved my daughter,” she said. “She had joined the police out of poverty. Fatima was my only breadwinner.”']",The guard was abducted while traveling to her home village and later killed. The United Nations says civilians continue to bear the brunt of the Afghan conflict.
"China Uses Quarantines as Cover to Detain Dissidents, Activists Say",2020-07-30,By Sui-Lee Wee,"['On the day of his release from prison, Wang Quanzhang, one of China’s most prominent human rights lawyers, thought he was finally free. After being held for nearly five years on charges of subversion of state power, Mr. Wang was escorted by the police to an apartment building in the eastern city of Jinan. There, he was given a room with iron bars on the windows. Twenty police officers stood guard outside. His mobile phone was confiscated, and his use of it was later restricted and monitored. Mr. Wang was effectively under temporary house arrest, but the authorities had another name for it: quarantine. Rights activists say the coronavirus has given the Chinese authorities a new pretext for detaining dissidents. Summary quarantines — often imposed just after detainees, like Mr. Wang, had cleared a previous one — are the latest way to silence dissent, part of a broader campaign under China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, to stamp out activism through arrests, detentions and harsher internet controls, activists say.  Before the pandemic, China had already mounted an intensive crackdown on human rights, which many activists have described as the most aggressive since the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Activists in quarantine are often detained without their families’ knowledge. They are typically “not allowed to communicate with the outside world, held in a secret location and not given the option to self-isolate at home,” said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a rights watchdog. “This treatment is de facto enforced disappearance,” she said. Though two-week quarantines are common in Asia for returning travelers, and prisons have been identified as hot spots for coronavirus transmission, the details of Mr. Wang’s case suggest that he was not detained purely for public health reasons. When he was forced into a two-week quarantine in April, the outbreak had already been tamed in Jinan, and people were free to move about the city and return to work. Mr. Wang said he had already tested negative for the virus five times in prison and had completed a 14-day quarantine before his release. “All of China now is about epidemic prevention,” said Mr. Wang, who was kept in prison for three years before even being charged, and who was the last of hundreds of human rights lawyers to be tried and sentenced after their arrests in 2015. “Under such a big slogan, personal freedom can be compromised and you can’t say anything,” he said. Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the pandemic had given the government an excuse to restrict movement so that it can “justify the violation of people’s human rights.” “These people are clearly not in any condition that needs to be quarantined,” Ms. Wang said. “It’s not science-based, it’s just an excuse for the government to restrict their movements and suppress their speech.” Ms. Eve said her rights group had documented nine cases of activists who were recently released from prison and then held in quarantine, but added that “there are likely many more.” Among those forcibly detained in quarantine, the group says, are a citizen journalist who tried to raise awareness about the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan; five labor rights activists; and a laid-off worker who, in an interview with a foreign news outlet, had urged people to take up arms against the ruling Communist Party. China’s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a request for comment. China’s government is not the only one to use the pandemic as an excuse to grab more power, restrict rights or crack down on dissent. The Indian government has rounded up and detained critics. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines recently empowered the police to enter people’s homes searching for the sick. And in Hungary, the prime minister can now rule by decree. Although Chinese law grants the government emergency powers to quarantine people during a public health emergency, several local officials have indicated that the practice of putting released convicts into quarantine violates those regulations. In the central province of Hubei, the police said that prisoners who complete their jail terms needed to be released within 24 hours, according to Shanghai Observer, a state-controlled news website. The Paper, a news site run by the government of Shanghai, cited police officials in Sichuan Province as saying that prisoners have to be released “in accordance with the law” after undergoing a 14-day quarantine inside the prison and a physical examination, which includes a nucleic acid test for the coronavirus, blood tests and a CT scan. Jiang Jiawen, 65 — the laid-off worker mentioned by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, who had called for resisting the Communist Party — completed a one-and-a-half-year sentence in March for “picking quarrels and causing trouble.” In July, he was en route to meet a friend at a Beijing railway station when he was waylaid by state security officers. They took him to a detention center and interrogated him, Mr. Jiang said. Then they told him he had to be quarantined, and they brought him to a hotel room in the northern city of Dandong, more than 500 miles away. The room had iron bars on the door and the windows. Two police officers and two government officials kept watch outside. No one took his temperature during the 14-day quarantine, Mr. Jiang said. Officials initially asked him to pay the $17 a day charge for the quarantine, he said, but he refused. “They just want to find a reason to detain us,” Mr. Jiang said. “The epidemic has given them a good reason.” Ding Yajun, a 51-year-old woman who had protested the forced demolition of her home, was released from prison on May 11 in the northern city of Harbin after serving a three-year sentence, also for “picking quarrels and causing trouble.” When she was in prison, officials swabbed her throat, did a blood test and subjected her to quarantine. Still, upon her release, Ms. Ding was placed in quarantine again. For more than a month, she was held in a windowless room that was kept locked with an iron baton, she said. She was finally released on June 16. Liu Xianbin, who spent 10 years in prison for writing articles critical of the Chinese government, was released on June 27 and told to complete a 14-day quarantine. But he was allowed to do so at home in the southwestern province of Sichuan, according to his wife, Chen Mingxian. “This is the national policy and these are special circumstances,” Ms. Chen said. “So we support and understand it.” Mr. Wang, the human rights lawyer, is now back in Beijing with his family. He says he is occasionally followed but does not believe he is under round-the-clock surveillance, as most dissidents are after being freed from prison. Recalling his time in quarantine after his release, Mr. Wang said that police officers often checked on him, even though he was supposed to be in isolation. “It was absurd,” he said. “The real purpose was to shut me up and tell me not to contact my friends.” Liu Yi contributed research.']","Critics of the government said they were held in rooms with barred windows and denied permission to contact their families, all in the name of public health."
Poacher Who Killed Gorilla Rafiki Sentenced to 11 Years in Prison in Uganda,2020-07-30,By Elian Peltier,"['A poacher who confessed to killing a rare silverback gorilla in Uganda in June was sentenced to 11 years in prison on Thursday, on charges of illegally entering a protected area and killing a gorilla, among other charges, authorities said. The silverback, known as Rafiki, was the leader of a group of more than a dozen gorillas known as the Nkuringo troop, which has been popular with visitors to Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park for decades. The nearly 80,000 acre UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to nearly half of the world’s mountain gorillas and has long drawn tourists from around the world hoping to catch a glimpse of the rare species. “We are relieved that Rafiki has received justice and this should serve as an example to other people who kill wildlife,” Sam Mwandha, Uganda Wildlife Authority’s executive director, said in a statement released Thursday. “If one person kills wildlife, we all lose.” Rafiki was believed to be about 25 years old when he went missing on June 1. His body was found the next day and four poachers were arrested a short time later. Byamukama Felix, one of the poachers, confessed to killing the silverback after entering the national park but said it was in self-defense. Mr. Felix pleaded guilty to three counts that included illegal entry into the protected area, killing a gorilla and killing a small antelope known as a duiker, the Uganda Wildlife Authority said the statement. Mr. Felix said he had gone hunting with another poacher when they came across the group of gorillas. Rafiki charged, he told the authorities, and he killed the silverback with a spear. The Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, in southwestern Uganda, is known for its exceptional biodiversity, and is a critical refuge for the mountain gorillas, a species that was once on the verge of extinction. Anti-poaching and conservation efforts have, in recent years, helped the population grow again. In 2018, the status of the silverback gorilla was changed from critically endangered to endangered by the Union for Conservation of Nature, the authority on the conservation status of the world’s species. A gorilla hadn’t been killed by a poacher in the park since 2011, according to the International Gorilla Conservation Programme. But the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on vital tourism in the region has made wildlife conservationists and park authorities wary that poaching could surge. According to the most recent census, 1,063 mountain gorillas remained in the wild as of 2018, 459 of which lived in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and in the adjacent Sarambwe Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Nkuringo troop that Rafiki led has been in the park since 1997, according to the Uganda Wildlife Authority, and earlier this month, the authority said the troop had stabilized to 11 members and had a new dominant gorilla, Rwamutwe. Fifteen troops have been habituated for tourism in the park. And the Ugandan Wildlife Authority also shared some happy news on Thursday: two baby gorillas were born in recent weeks to two different troops in the national park.']","The man had confessed to killing Rafiki, a rare silverback gorilla who was the leader of the famed Nkuringo gorilla troop, popular with tourists."
"For Senegal’s Biggest Holiday, a Shortage of the All-Important Sheep",2020-07-29,By Ruth Maclean,"['MISSIRAH, Senegal — The couscous was all ready for the lunchtime crowd in Yassin Dicko’s restaurant near one of the biggest sheep markets in Senegal. But except for family members, the place was empty. Ms. Dicko’s usual customers, shepherds from Mauritania, had not shown up. She looked outside to the vast holding area where just a few meager herds of sheep trotted around, their bleating oddly human. While the corrals in Missirah, in central Senegal, are usually packed with sheep at this time of year, hardly any salesmen had shown up. Almost no buyers either. “This is a real crisis,” she said. It was 13 days before Tabaski, the Senegalese version of Eid al-Adha, the biggest religious celebration of the year in the country, which is about 95 percent Muslim. No sheep for the Tabaski feast for a Muslim Senegalese family is like no presents at Christmas for a Christian one, and in the two weeks before the holiday, which takes place this year on July 31, there is usually a shopping rush for the animals. But monthslong government-imposed measures to contain the coronavirus — borders closed, markets shuttered and travel severely restricted — have been financially devastating for many people in Senegal, putting a purchase of great cultural and social importance beyond the reach of many this year. Even in ordinary years, the sheep is a major purchase for many families, who take out high-interest loans to pay for it and the other food and new clothes that are typically an obligatory part of the celebration. Owners guard their sheep purchases closely, sometimes even sleeping in the same room with the animal, to avoid falling victim to a theft. While most families buy their sheep in the month before Tabaski, some buy them a year or more in advance and do the fattening up themselves. This year, aware that citizens would be worried about catching the virus at in-person markets, the livestock ministry set up a Tinder-like digital matchmaking site, where sellers could post appealing photos of their sheep. Buyers were able to swipe left or right through hundreds of sheep profiles on Sama Xaru Tabaski — or “My Tabaski Sheep” in Wolof, the most widely spoken of Senegal’s many languages — and then arrange a deal for the animal that catches their fancy, skipping hours of risky face-to-face haggling. But the service has received meager traffic so far, and even if a would-be buyer can find a sheep, it may not be affordable. A $140 sheep last year now costs over $170, with the hike attributable, according to industry players, to the ripple effects of the coronavirus restrictions. Around half of Senegal’s Tabaski sheep come from neighboring Mali and Mauritania, and until late June, all the herds were completely stuck on the other side of the border, except those smuggled across. Now sheep are welcome, but even though the bovid border has been reopened, the expected surge of sheep has not materialized. One reason is that sheep now must be transported only in trucks, and many drivers are charging twice as much as usual to move the animals. On a recent Saturday, shepherds, swinging their sticks, yipped and whooped their skinny charges into the back of a truck in Kidira, a town in Senegal on the border with Mali where the sheep had been let out to graze. They were traveling to Dakar with the animals, riding in hammocks strung from truck beams above their undulant flocks. Watching the shepherds and their charges scurry aboard was Alassane Ndongo, president of the local herders’ association. While three shepherds can ride in each truck, Mr. Ndongo said that owners don’t because they generally travel alongside by car, and cars are banned from crossing the border. So many owners were simply keeping their flocks home, another reason for the shortages. In addition, Mr. Ndongo added, in typical years, many herds would cross the border on foot. But that requires setting off months in advance, and in 2020, that start date for the journey was just when governments were ordering everyone indoors. While the restrictions imposed to combat the coronavirus have been financially devastating for many, Senegal has not been as hard hit as many countries by Covid-19. Fewer than 10,000 people have had it, of whom 194 have died, according to official figures. In Dakar, Senegal’s capital, where the streets every year run red with sheep’s blood on Tabaski morning, Abou Gallo Thiello Kane runs the swankiest sheep mall in town, a spacious, manicured tent full of magnificent beasts. A famous mbalax dancer and comedian as well as sheep merchant to the stars — local celebrities and government ministers are said to be among his clients — Mr. Kane’s 20 years in the business have taught him what prospective buyers look for. “Women usually want a fat sheep, and a young one, because they’re thinking about how it will taste,” he said from behind a mask, as assistants hauled mangers up and down his ovine kingdom. “Men, on the other hand, buy for aesthetics, and for love.” Professional butchers are kept busy in Dakar for those who are too squeamish to slit the animal’s throat themselves or for those who have grown too close to their woolly companion. “Sheep for us are like dogs for Europeans,” said Mr. Kane, who is also president of the National Federation of Sheep Industry Actors. “They’re good company. They’re useful, and they’re friendly.” The sheep’s role in the Tabaski celebration is far more central than just providing a meal. Eid al-Adha honors the story of Ibrahim, whom God asked to sacrifice his cherished son, Ismail, but then told him at the last minute he could swap in a ram. “God did not tell Ibrahim to kill the sheep, or to eat it,” Mr. Kane said. “He said it should be a sacrifice. So you have to choose the sheep you love.” Most of Mr. Kane’s sheep are less lovable than imposing: They are Ladoums, an enormous and majestic crossbreed much prized by the Senegalese, for whom the mere mention of a Ladoum can elicit a wistful sigh. Mr. Kane’s best Ladoums sell for up to $3,500, and as I spoke with their owner, the regal creatures seemed to know it. One tossed his long tail; another stamped groomed hooves in freshly sprinkled sand. A third, his ears poking through striped, curling horns, looked up with a snooty expression as we walked past. They needn’t be so conceited. This year, even elite buyers are thin on the ground, Mr. Kane said. The reduced incomes brought by the pandemic shutdown has pushed some Senegalese from comfortable to struggling. Ms. Dicko, the restaurant owner, said she was worrying about her friends and neighbors, those who used to make $9 a day and now could only make $4. For them, she said, a sheep was out of the question, and tough days were ahead. “There will be a lot of hardship,” she said. Ousmane Balde contributed reporting.']","Properly celebrating Tabaski, as Eid al-Adha is known in Senegal, requires a sacrificial sheep.

U.N. Panel Takes Aim at Heavy-Handed Police Tactics at Protests,2020-07-29,By Nick Cumming-Bruce,"['GENEVA — Law-enforcement authorities are obligated to protect and facilitate peaceful demonstrations, an influential United Nations human rights panel said on Wednesday, challenging tactics the police have used against anti-racism protests in American cities and around the world. The international treaty governing civil and political rights requires states to allow peaceful demonstrations, not to block or disrupt them without a compelling reason, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said. Authorities should also seek to de-escalate situations that might lead to violence and to use only the minimum force necessary to disperse crowds. “A failure to respect and ensure the right of peaceful assembly is typically a marker of repression,” the panel said in its finding. The committee of 18 international law experts monitors compliance with the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, a cornerstone of human rights law signed by 173 countries, including the United States.  The panel’s comment, a product of more than two years of deliberations, sets out international guidelines that speak to issues central to America’s deepening discord over the Trump administration’s response to the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland and elsewhere. The protests in Portland and elsewhere swelled after the administration dispatched federal law enforcement officials to confront demonstrators over the objections of local officials.  The U.S. Attorney General, William P. Barr, defended the administration’s intervention during heated exchanges on Tuesday with the House Judiciary Committee, asserting that “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction.”  On Wednesday, Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said the U.S. government had agreed to remove tactical teams that had been deployed to Portland, and that the state would provide extra security for the federal courthouse in the city. The panel’s findings are not legally binding. But the timing of the comments thrusts the U.N. into a divisive debate roiling the United States during the heat of a presidential campaign. The U.N. panel said that law enforcement authorities should facilitate demonstrations and restrict the use of force to control or disperse protesters. It said crowds should be dispersed “only in exceptional cases” and after the authorities have exhausted nonviolent means to de-escalate tensions. “It is a fundamental human right for individuals to join a peaceful assembly to express themselves, to celebrate, or to air grievances,” said Christof Heyns, a law professor at South Africa’s University of Pretoria and the panel member who drafted the document. “Together with other rights related to political freedom, it constitutes the very foundation of a democratic society.” The United States, while endorsing some of the committee’s guidance, said in a commentary that the panel’s observations were “beyond its competence and mandate and contrary to international law.” The panel said military or paramilitary forces should not be used to police gatherings except in extraordinary circumstances and that concealing the identity of the police, a practice followed by federal agents in unmarked vehicles in Portland, undercut accountability. It also took aim at the use of tear gas, which has been heavily used by law enforcement agencies in Portland and elsewhere. It said tear gas should only be used as a last resort, and that rubber bullets should only be fired in response to an imminent threat of death or serious injury. The committee also asserted the “particular importance” of journalists and human rights defenders in monitoring demonstrations, emphasizing they should not be harassed or their equipment confiscated or damaged. Even if violence erupted to a point that justified dispersing a crowd, it did not justify dispersing journalists. “All of these are lessons that the government of the United States should be taking very much to heart,” said Gerald Neuman, a professor of international law at Harvard University who served on the committee. Human rights experts said the panel’s findings put a critical spotlight on the actions of federal agents in Portland and other cities and reinforce concerns that the heavy-handed policing there falls far short of international standards. “There are serious questions as to whether the administration’s response in Portland is sufficiently de-escalatory, respectful of rights, discerning about differences between peaceful and violent protesters, restrained in the use of force and weapons,” said Harold Hongju Koh, a Yale Law School professor who served as the State Department’s legal adviser in the Obama administration. “Of special concern is whether the federal agents being deployed have appropriate training,” he added.']",The comments by the United Nations Human Rights Committee come as the Trump administration faces growing criticism for deploying federal agents to confront Black Lives Matter protesters.
U.K. Officials’ New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?,2020-07-31,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II threw him an extravagant state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Former Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed him to Blenheim Palace, the family seat of his hero, Winston Churchill. Her successor, Boris Johnson, refused to join a global chorus of criticism after he ordered troops to break up a Black Lives Matter protest outside the White House. Few countries have worked harder than Britain to please President Trump. But now, with Mr. Trump trailing in the polls to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., British officials are waking up to an unsettling prospect: The president they tried so hard to accommodate may be out of power next year. In Paris and Berlin, a Trump defeat would be welcomed as an unalloyed relief, removing a leader who has sundered alliances, threatened a trade war, and tried to dismantle the European project. But in London, where Mr. Johnson’s government just left the European Union, it is more complicated. At a moment of British isolation, Mr. Trump’s full-throated endorsement of Brexit has made the United States a safe harbor. His promise of a lucrative trade deal gave Mr. Johnson a selling point with his voters. His populist politics were in sync with the bare-knuckle tactics of the Brexiteers. If Mr. Biden wins in November, Britain would face a president who opposed Brexit, would look out for the interests of Ireland in a post-Brexit Europe, and would have little motive to prioritize an Anglo-American trade deal. His former boss, President Barack Obama, once warned Britons that if they left the European Union, they would put themselves at the “back of the queue” in any trade talks with the United States. “It will not be lost on Biden that the last two British prime ministers went out of their way to be nice to and about Trump,” said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States. “He is instinctively comfortable with Brits, but London will have to work on the relationship.” As Mr. Trump’s polling numbers have eroded, pro-government papers have begun to make the case that a President Biden would actually be better for Britain than President Trump. Unlike Mr. Trump, he is a believer in alliances. He would not subject Mr. Johnson to rude lectures about the need for Britain to take a harder line against China. He would not be toxic with much of the British public. In a recent column in The Sunday Times, a well-connected political journalist, Tim Shipman, quoted an unnamed government minister saying that a Trump defeat ‘‘would make things much easier.’’ That sounds like a government hedging its bets. Mr. Johnson has been careful to say nothing about the American election but he has already tried to keep Mr. Trump at arm’s length even as he avoids offending him. Mr. Trump, by contrast, called into a London radio show in the heat of the British election to praise Mr. Johnson and run down his opponent. Britain’s uneasiness is compounded by the strangeness of this election. The Biden campaign has all but banned contact with foreign governments to avoid the questions that dogged the Trump campaign in 2016 about its ties to Russia. The pandemic has deprived Britain of its long practice of embedding a diplomat in the challenger’s campaign because there is little in-person campaigning. Jonathan Powell, who as a young British diplomat rode on the bus during Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, said the connections he made were valuable in smoothing over bitterness Mr. Clinton’s aides felt toward Britain’s Conservative government after it tried to dig up incriminating details about Mr. Clinton’s years at Oxford to help George H.W. Bush’s campaign. Mr. Powell later introduced Mr. Clinton to Tony Blair, who went on to become prime minister and a friendlier counterpart. Riding the bus is less important this time, he said, given that Mr. Biden is already so well-known to British officials. But the lack of a personal connection may foretell a relationship that is destined to become more distant. The risk for Britain, several experts said, is not a sudden rupture but a gradual slide into irrelevance. Mr. Biden’s emphasis, they said, would be on mending fences with Berlin and Paris, not celebrating a “special relationship” with London that got plenty of attention from his predecessor. On a visit to London in October 2018, Mr. Biden, not yet a candidate, cast his opposition to Brexit in geopolitical terms, saying it would make Britain less valuable to the United States as a lever to influence the European Union. “Had I been a member of Parliament, had I been a British citizen, I would have voted against leaving,” Mr. Biden said at Chatham House, the London research institution. “U.S. interests,” he added, “are diminished with Great Britain not an integral part of Europe.” Charles A. Kupchan, a professor at Georgetown University who worked on European affairs in the Obama White House and is advising Mr. Biden’s campaign, said, “The question is not, ‘Will there be a special relationship?’ There will be. The question is, ‘Will the special relationship matter?’” British officials recognize the challenge. They cite human rights and Russia as areas where Britain could carve out a robust role alongside the United States. Mr. Johnson’s recent reversal barring the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from access to its 5G network brings Britain in line with a more hawkish American policy toward China. That is likely to extend beyond Mr. Trump’s presidency. He may need to patch up other lingering issues. In 2016, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, he recounted in a newspaper column that Mr. Obama replaced a bust of Churchill in the Oval Office with one of Martin Luther King Jr., and attributed the switch to “the part-Kenyan president’s ancestral dislike of the British Empire.” Some say fears of tension between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Biden are overblown. “It’s part of the job for American presidents to get along with prime ministers,” said Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member of Parliament who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and has spoken with advisers to Mr. Biden. Still, there are potential land mines, not least Northern Ireland. A devoted Irish-American, Mr. Biden will fiercely defend Ireland’s interests, as will his allies in the Democratic Party’s Irish lobby on Capitol Hill. In speeches, Mr. Biden’s go-to literary reference is from ‘‘Easter 1916,’’ a poem by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats about the Irish uprising against British rule. British diplomats gamely point out that Mr. Biden has English roots, too. He has talked of a great-great-great grandfather who was a captain in the British East India Trading Company. But they say that as far as Brexit goes, his primary concern is likely to be the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement, the Clinton-era accord that ended decades of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland. “Biden is very keen on his Irish Catholic roots, though he has British ones too,” Mr. Westmacott said. “If the U.K. ends up with a no deal or other Brexit outcome which is bad news for Ireland, he will not be impressed.” So far, Mr. Johnson has avoided that problem by striking a withdrawal agreement with the European Union that leaves an open border on the island of Ireland. But Ireland could still suffer economic damage if Britain fails to negotiate permanent trading arrangements with Brussels. Trade is another area where Mr. Biden could prove frustrating. Mr. Trump’s promise of a blockbuster deal with Britain had already begun to fade, with his trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, saying last month it was unlikely before the election. Were Mr. Biden to win, experts said, he would face a Democratic Party deeply skeptical of a deal, at a time when free trade is in retreat worldwide. British officials recently floated the idea of both countries joining the successor agreement to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump pulled out of in 2017, as a way to sidestep the thorny issues in a direct negotiation. But even if Mr. Biden were to rejoin T.P.P. — a big if — analysts noted that its provisions on food sanitation were largely written by the United States and would raise the same objections that have stymied trans-Atlantic talks. “In other words,” said Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Center for European Reform, “the chlorine chicken debate is here to stay.”']","If Joe Biden wins the November election, Britain would face a president who opposed Brexit, would look out for Ireland, and may have little interest in a trade deal."
Hong Kong Bans Eating in Restaurants. And Then It Doesn’t.,2020-07-31,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — Hong Kongers have rarely seen their government react so swiftly to public opinion. On Thursday, city officials lifted a ban on dining in restaurants — imposed just a day earlier, to fight the spread of the coronavirus — after a public outcry sparked by pictures of workers and older people eating outside in the punishing July heat, on pavements, curbs and the steps of footbridges. Hong Kong is battling its worst community outbreak since the pandemic began, after initial success in containing the coronavirus. This month, the death toll nearly doubled in a week — as of Friday, it stood at 27 — and infections sharply spiked. Some new clusters were linked to nursing homes and restaurants, while scores of other cases had no known origin. The government’s initial response included limits on restaurants’ opening hours, with dining in allowed until 6 p.m. but forbidden after that. But with case numbers staying high, dine-in service was banned altogether on Wednesday — leaving many working-class residents, used to grabbing a quick bite during the lunch hour at one of Hong Kong’s countless inexpensive restaurants, with nowhere to go. Photos of the results quickly went viral, including one of a 62-year-old cleaner eating in a park during a downpour, huddled under an umbrella. (“What can I do; I can only blame myself for being poor,” a local news outlet, Citizen News, quoted the man as saying.) Chan Chun-heung, 50, who sells vegetables at a wet market in the Wan Chai District, said she had to eat her Wednesday lunch sitting on the ground. “I had to cover my food whenever someone walked past me, otherwise the dust would get everywhere,” Ms. Chan said. “And it was so hot.” Critics accused the government of failing to think about working people who can’t spend their lunch breaks in air-conditioned offices. Stung by the reaction, officials scrambled to open 19 community centers across the city as makeshift shelters where people could go for lunch. Then, on Thursday, it reversed the policy altogether, announcing that dining in for breakfast and lunch could resume the next day. (Dinner is still limited to takeout or delivery.) The mini-furor tapped into longstanding perceptions that Hong Kong’s policymakers, many of them well-heeled, are out of touch with how most people live. (Carrie Lam, the city’s unpopular leader, was once mocked for not knowing where to buy toilet paper.) Daphne Ho, the organizing secretary of the Construction Site Workers General Union, said many construction workers had crowded together in a covered area for lunch on Wednesday. Others ate at dust-filled, poorly ventilated construction sites, and some opted to skip lunch altogether, she said. “Many people thought, why couldn’t Hong Kongers even have the dignity to eat a meal?” Ms. Ho said. “Why did they have to squat in the streets?” Ms. Chan, the vegetable seller, was relieved on Thursday to be able to eat at one of the converted shelters near her market. A few other residents ate takeout at sparsely distributed tables, all facing the wall, while a pack of reporters waited outside to interview them. Before the shelters were opened, a wide variety of venues — including churches, hotels, clinics, hair salons and art studios — had offered to let people eat in their facilities free. Critics of the government were quick to tie that spirit of grass-roots solidarity to the city’s pro-democracy protest movement, which has seen a variety of mutual aid networks spring up. Health officials have tied Hong Kong’s current surge to incoming travelers who had been exempted from quarantine requirements, including airline crew, sailors and some business executives. (Quarantine rules have since been tightened.) Ben Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, said that unless crowds were present, eating lunch outdoors was a “low-risk activity, but not very comfortable.” But the risks of dining in are also limited, he said, “given the measures that had already been put in place in restaurants, including screens between tables, temperature checks and hand sanitizers.”']","City officials did a quick U-turn in the face of public anger, after viral photos showed workers eating lunch on curbs and bridges in the hot sun."
"One in Three Children Have Unacceptably High Lead Levels, Study Says",2020-07-30,By Rick Gladstone,"['Lead contamination has long been recognized as a health hazard, particularly for the young. But a new study asserts that the extent of the problem is far bigger than previously thought, with one in three children worldwide — about 800 million in all — threatened by unacceptably high lead levels in their blood. The ubiquity of lead — in dust and fumes from smelters and fires, vehicle batteries, old peeling paint, old water pipes, electronics junkyards, and even cosmetics and lead-infused spices — represents an enormous and understated risk to the mental and physical development of a generation of children, according to the study, released late Wednesday. The danger is particularly acute in poor and middle-income countries where industrial pollution safeguards are poorly enforced or nonexistent. “The unequivocal conclusion of this research is that children around the world are being poisoned by lead on a massive and previously unrecognized scale,” said the study, a collaboration of UNICEF and Pure Earth, a nonprofit that seeks to help poor countries threatened by toxic pollutants. The study also said that nearly one million adults a year die prematurely because of lead exposure. The authors said they based their analysis and statistical conclusions on research compiled by United Nations agencies including the World Health Organization, as well as by numerous universities and nonprofit groups. The authors also used modeling techniques from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent health research center that is part of the University of Washington. Their primary conclusion was that one-third of the world’s children, up to the age of 19, have blood lead levels at or exceeding five micrograms per deciliter, a threshold that both the W.H.O. and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined is a cause for action. Most children in the United States and many other developed countries have lead levels well below this threshold, the study said, although in some areas they are “dangerously high.” The vast majority of affected children, it said, “live in poor countries where they are exposed to lead through multiple routes.” Nicholas Rees, a policy specialist on climate and environment at UNICEF and one of the study’s co-authors, said the consequences are dire. “When you’re talking about a third of the world’s children, you’re talking about a potential loss of learning opportunities, an impact on future wages, you’re talking about a tremendous burden on society,” he said. A major contributor to lead poisoning is a surge in the recycling of lead in automotive batteries to satisfy soaring growth in the numbers of cars and trucks, particularly in the developing world, the study said. While lead recycling for batteries is heavily regulated in the United States, it is often done haphazardly in poor and middle-income countries. A global industry group of lead battery manufacturers and recyclers said it did not dispute the study’s conclusions on battery recycling, which accounts for the vast majority of all lead use. “We want to see an end to all informal and unregulated recycling as documented by Pure Earth and UNICEF,” the group said in a statement. At the same time, the group said, “we cannot do this alone.” It emphasized its own efforts in helping member companies ensure that “inappropriately recycled lead does not enter our supply chain.” The group also said it provides consulting to countries on improving recycling standards. “For many people in low- and middle-income countries, informal and unregulated recycling is a subsistence issue, and the materials they are handling have a high economic value,” it said. “Governments and regulators in these countries must incentivize high-performing, regulated recyclers and crack down on the informal sector and its practices.” Perry Gottesfeld, an expert on lead poisoning prevention who is executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce industrial pollutants, said that, if anything, the new study may have underestimated the number of adults who die of exposure to lead poisoning. Mr. Gottesfeld also said the study did not hold lead recycling companies sufficiently accountable for the contamination problem. While the industry is “much more regulated in the United States than anywhere else,” he said, it would be misleading to describe lead recycling as safe even if done properly. Lead has been known as a potent neurotoxin for hundreds of years — Benjamin Franklin wrote of its harm in 1786 — but the most insidious effects have become clearer only in recent decades. The exposure of children to lead is linked to reductions in I.Q. scores, shortened attention spans and potentially violent and criminal behavior. Fetuses and children under 5 are at the greatest risk of lifelong damage. Richard Fuller, president of Pure Earth and a co-author of the study, said he believed it was not just coincidence that the violence and instability in many parts of the developing world are in regions where lead contamination is relatively high. “I think getting rid of lead is going to reduce violence,” he said. “I just wonder if this might be one of the most important things.” But he also acknowledged the lack of a substitute for lead-acid batteries. “Honestly, I would love if we didn’t have these things in the world,” Mr. Fuller said.']","“Children around the world are being poisoned by lead on a massive and previously unrecognized scale,” according to the study, a collaboration of UNICEF and Pure Earth, an advocacy group."
Paris Beehives Trace Notre-Dame’s Toxic Fallout,2020-07-29,By Elian Peltier,"['The hundreds of tons of lead that burned in the April 2019 fire that nearly destroyed Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris created a dangerous dust that landed in parks, buildings and playgrounds, raising health alarms. Now, scientists say, some of that lead has found its way to a surprising place: honey produced by urban beehives. A study outlined this week in Environmental Science & Technology Letters found that honey samples collected northwest of the cathedral, downwind from the fire, contained nearly three times as much lead on average than did those from before the fire. As investigators continue to seek the origins of the fire that ravaged the 850-year-old cathedral, and scientists, architects and historians study the building’s fragile structure and the debris, other research has focused on the pollution caused by the 460 tons of lead that burned that night. The honey study, conducted by Kate Smith and Dominique Weis of the University of British Columbia, is one of the first to explore the relationship between pollution from the fire and its impact on residents through a product they can ingest directly. The honey’s lead concentration — an average of 2.3 nanograms per gram — fell within consumable standards, said Ms. Smith, a doctoral candidate in geological sciences and the lead author of the study. She said the higher lead levels matched the geographical distribution of the dust cloud that was carried across Paris from the fire. “The evidence is pretty strong that the fire caused the lead elevation observed in the honey,” Ms. Smith said. Urban beekeeping has increased sharply in cities like Paris over the past decade, and the city estimated recently that it has more than 1,000 hives. Bees have taken up residence on the roofs of the gilded Opera Garnier and prestigious restaurants, in the flower-rich Luxembourg Gardens, and at Notre-Dame, too, where 200,000 bees that lived on the roof survived the fire. The study on the Parisian hives drew from 36 honey samples that were collected in July 2019, several months after the fire. Samples from before the fire were used as a reference point. It found that honey collected downwind of Notre-Dame had lead levels three times those in samples collected elsewhere in central Paris not only before the fire, but also after. In one hive, the levels were nearly nine times normal. Ms. Smith said that while the levels measured in the honey were safe, Parisians were right to have been worried about alarming lead concentrations in the aftermath of the fire. “Lead is recognized for its toxicity,” Ms. Smith said. “The health risk doesn’t diminish simply because the lead was not deposited recently.” Ms. Smith’s research focuses on how bees can act as sensitive pollution detectors. When bees forage for pollen or nectar, they pick up tiny particles of lead and other metals, and the honey they produce provides a snapshot of their hive’s immediate surroundings. Researchers continue to be concerned about the effects of pollution from the Notre-Dame fire. In a study of lead levels in Parisian soils published earlier this month, scientists at Columbia University found that people living within 1,100 yards and downwind of the fire were likely to have been exposed to more lead fallout than previously announced. Previous investigations by the French news website Mediapart and later by The New York Times found unsafe lead levels in dozens of places across Paris, including schools, parks and day-care centers. City and state authorities did not order lead testing until a month after the fire, and it took four months to complete a full decontamination of the cathedral’s neighborhood. If ingested, lead can produce cognitive damage, especially in children. City officials have acknowledged that Paris needs a more comprehensive lead-abatement plan, and scientists are investigating whether rainwater dropping from the roof of Notre-Dame may have polluted the Seine river for centuries. Professor Weis, the other lead author of the study, was in Paris the day after the fire and said she has stayed far from the cathedral out of fear of lead exposure. Although the lead levels measured in the honey accounted for “80 drops of water in an Olympic swimming pool,” she said, they should still act as a warning. “For Paris, it’s not dramatically high and it doesn’t mean that the honey cannot be eaten,” Professor Weis added about the lead levels. “But honey here is the canary in the coal mine.”']","Bees can act as tiny pollution detectors, say researchers, who found higher but still safe lead levels in honey gathered downwind of the cathedral."
Turkey Passes Law Extending Sweeping Powers Over Social Media,2020-07-29,By Marc Santora,"['Turkish lawmakers passed legislation on Wednesday that would give the government sweeping new powers to regulate social media content, raising concerns that one of the few remaining spaces for free public debate in the country could fall under greater government control. The bill orders social media platforms with over one million daily users — such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube — to open offices in Turkey and imposes stiff penalties if the international companies refuse, including slowing the bandwidth of the sites and making them largely inaccessible. These offices would be responsible for responding to the demands of the government and individuals to block or remove content hosted on their platforms that is deemed offensive. They would have 48 hours to comply and could be fined more than $700,000 if they fail to respond.  The new law, which is expected to go into effect  Oct. 1, also requires the social media companies to store user data inside Turkey, raising privacy concerns. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his governing A.K.P. party, having already taken control over most of the nation’s traditional media outlets, were behind the legislation, arguing that it was needed to protect citizens from cybercrime and slander. Critics, however, say it is part of a broader effort to control the flow of information in the country and stifle dissent. “The new law will enable the government to control social media, to get content removed at will and to arbitrarily target individual users,” Tom Porteous, deputy program director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement released hours before the overnight vote. “Social media is a lifeline for many people who use it to access news, so this law signals a new dark era of online censorship.” The attempts to gain control over social media in Turkey highlight the paradox the platforms present in the digital age.  They have been used to spread disinformation in Western democracies, including by hostile foreign powers bent on sowing chaos and influencing elections. Efforts by social media platforms to police the content they host have repeatedly fallen short, and governments have yet to devise successful strategies to regulate content without unwittingly infringing on free speech.   But they have also proved to be an increasingly essential tool for debate and dialogue in repressive and autocratic nations, one of the last arenas where opposition figures can connect with the public, and citizens can attempt to hold politicians to account.  More than 90 percent of Turkey’s conventional media is now controlled by conglomerates close to the government. Hundreds of reporters have been jailed or fled the country out of fear and Mr. Erdogan has made himself so omnipresent on TV and radio that his voice can drown out all others. The internet is now, for many,  the last open public forum. In passing the bill,  supporters acknowledged that it would allow the government to exert more authority in the digital realm. “Today, while all the conventional media is acting within a certain discipline and order, we will be regulating social media who is acting entirely on its own,” Cahit Ozkan, deputy head of the A.K.P., said on Tuesday in televised remarks. Mr. Erdogan has made no secret of his disdain for social media and of his desire to exert control over digital spaces, much in the same way his government has gained control over traditional media. Six years ago, when he was embroiled in a corruption scandal widely reported on social media, he vowed to restrict access to the sites. “We will not allow this nation to be devoured by YouTube, Facebook or whatever,” Mr. Erdogan said at the time. “We will take necessary steps in the firmest way.” In 2016, months before an attempted coup, Turkey moved even more aggressively to censor content on the internet, as the number of people prosecuted for insulting Mr. Erdogan in posts on social media skyrocketed. At the same time, internet trolls loyal to the government used social media platforms to attack critics and journalists.  In 2017, the country shocked many international observers when it banned Wikipedia, a restriction that was lifted only this past January. Last summer, Turkey gave its media regulatory authority sweeping control over streaming services, including entertainment sites like Netflix.  Netflix, which is the most prominent streaming service in Turkey, has already run into difficulties with Turkish censors and has had to edit content of its Turkish-produced programs, removing cigarettes and blurring suggestive gestures. Last week, Netflix canceled its fourth Turkish production a day before filming was scheduled to begin, after the Turkish media regulatory authority refused permission for filming. Ece Yorenc, the screenplay writer, said the authority had refused to grant permission for the series “If Only” because of a gay character in the series. Netflix chose to cancel the entire series rather than change the content, she said. The issue of social media content took a personal turn more recently, when Mr. Erdogan’s newborn grandson — the fourth child of his daughter, Esra Albayrak, and Berat Albayrak, who is also the  finance minister — was insulted on various social media platforms. “Those spaces where lies, defamation, attack to personal rights, character assassinations are running wild, should be put in order,” Mr. Erdogan told party officials in a televised speech on July 1. “We want such social media spaces to be entirely removed, to be controlled,” he added. But criticism of the law was swift, filling the very sites the government was seeking to control. Yaman Akdeniz, an expert in online rights, wrote on Twitter that “a new and dark period in Turkey is starting.” “The aim is to silence,” he wrote. “It is the intention of the government to clean its past from critical content including news coverage of corruption allegations as well as all sorts of irregularities.” Even without the new bill, Turkey blocked access to more than 400,000 websites by the end of 2019, according to Mr. Akdeniz, whose organization, the Freedom of Expression Association, compiles an annual report on internet access in the country. According to his analysis, last year more than 130,000 web addresses were blocked; 40,000 posts on Twitter taken down; 10,000 YouTube videos removed; and 6,200 Facebook posts scrubbed from the site.  The new bill will give the government even greater freedom to remove content of independent news outlets which are the almost the only source of unbiased local news coverage in Turkish. For many in Turkey, social media is also the last forum where they can publicly express grievances on topics raging from violence against women to political corruption. Before the vote, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that the law “would give the state powerful tools for asserting even more control over the media landscape.” Quinn McKew, executive director of Article 19, an advocacy group for an open internet and free expression, said that the law placed companies in a difficult position.  “Social media companies face either becoming the long arm of the state censorship or having access to their platforms slowed so much that they are in effect blocked in Turkey,” she said. “Given the erosion of the rule of law in Turkey under the current government, tech companies cannot rely on the courts to challenge blocking decisions or requests for user data.” Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on the bill. According to Twitter’s transparency report for the first half of 2019, Turkey had the highest number of content removal request, with more than 6,000. Raymond Zhong, Adam Satariano and Carlotta Gall contributed reporting.  ']","The legislation extends control over platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

"Zimbabwe Locks Down Capital, Thwarting Planned Protests",2020-07-31,By Jeffrey Moyo and Patrick Kingsley,"['HARARE, Zimbabwe — When Robert Mugabe was ousted as president of Zimbabwe in a coup in 2017, many in the country hoped for an end to the repression and mismanagement that had characterized his 37 years in office. But when protesters tried to gather on Friday in the capital, Harare, the security services reacted in a manner reminiscent of the Mugabe era. They shut down most of the city, arrested several government critics and forced more than a dozen others into hiding — highlighting how the country has, in the eyes of the opposition, slipped from bad to worse under Mr. Mugabe’s successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mr. Mnangagwa took power on a promise of renewal, but his critics associate him with the same excesses that defined Mr. Mugabe’s legacy: authoritarian rule, financial missteps, rampant graft, plummeting living standards and a teetering economy. “In reality, there is nothing new,” said Obey Sithole, a leading opposition campaigner who went into hiding days before the planned protests. “Instead, we have seen the perfection of the art of repression.” And the government’s halting response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has exposed the awful state of the country’s health care system and led to further allegations of corruption, has fueled widespread anger. In an interview with The Times last year, Mr. Mnangagwa, 77, described himself as a leader with a “new dispensation.” But in some respects, Mr. Mnangagwa — a veteran of the guerrilla war that ended white-minority rule, and one of Mr. Mugabe’s most trusted sidekicks — has proved to be an even harsher president than Mr. Mugabe. The number of opposition activists charged with a form of treason during Mr. Mnangagwa’s three years in office is already higher than during Mr. Mugabe’s entire tenure, according to research by a coalition of 22 Zimbabwean rights groups. Opposition activists hoped to hold mass rallies on Friday, partly in response to a new wave of arrests and abductions that began in May, when three female opposition activists, including a lawmaker, were abducted, beaten and sexually assaulted by people they say were plainclothes government agents. (The government denied involvement and, after being treated in hospital, the women were charged with false accusations.) But Mr. Mnangagwa’s government refused to allow even this largely symbolic expression of dissent. To deter protesters in the prelude to the demonstrations, the police seized the leader of an opposition group who had been helping to organize the rally and a prominent investigative journalist who had helped reveal a possible corruption scheme involving the country’s health minister, Obadiah Moyo. More than a dozen opposition politicians, activists and union leaders, including Mr. Sithole, then went into hiding after the police named them on a wanted list. And on Friday, the police deployed personnel across the city, shutting down most major transit routes and deterring most would-be protesters from gathering. Several of those who did try to assemble said that they had been detained, including the author Tsitsi Dangarembga, three days after her novel “This Mournable Body” was longlisted for the Booker Prize, a prestigious British literary award. “During President Mugabe’s era, there were serious, gross human rights violations,” said Robson Chere, the head of a major teachers’ union, and one of those now in hiding. “But the current so-called new dispensation has gone several gears up.” The situation has led to tensions within Mr. Mnangagwa’s political party. A party official was fired this week after being accused of helping to promote the protests, and the government itself has been forced to deny that the military that brought Mr. Mnangagwa to power was now seeking to oust him. Those hoping to demonstrate on Friday had an extra grievance — Mr. Mnangagwa’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which critics see as reflective of his government’s wider faults. Already close to collapse before the pandemic, hospitals lack enough drugs, ventilators, personal protection equipment and staff, because many doctors and nurses have moved abroad in search of better pay or gone on strike to protest their low wages. Police officers have used coronavirus restrictions as a pretext to arrest the government’s political opponents, according to Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, a watchdog group based in Harare. Mr. Moyo, the health minister, was fired in July after buying coronavirus supplies at inflated prices through a multimillion-dollar contract with an obscure foreign firm that was signed without the approval of the relevant state authorities, according to court documents. Mr. Moyo, who has yet to be replaced, was arrested and is on trial. “The system has collapsed under our president,” said Dr. Peter Magombeyi, a former head of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, a labor union. “We are noticing that there are no doctors, there are no nurses, there are no drugs, not enough personal protective equipment, no hospital C.E.O.s, no health care minister.” The leadership of Mr. Mnangagwa’s party had urged supporters to “take on” the protesters, and attempted to portray the possibility of demonstrations as a Western plot. “None of it is coming from Zimbabweans,” said Tafadzwa Mugwadi, the party’s director of information. Another party official, Patrick Chinamasa, said that the American ambassador to Zimbabwe, Brian A. Nichols, might be expelled from the country, after the U.S. Embassy issued a series of tweets criticizing some of the arrests this month. Mr. Chinamasa said at a news briefing on Monday that if Mr. Nichols were to continue “engaging in acts of mobilizing and funding disturbances, coordinating violence and training fighters,” then “our leadership will not hesitate to give him marching orders.” But in reality, there is plenty of homegrown anger — not only about rights violations, but also about the dire state of the health system and deteriorating living conditions. Corruption and mismanagement have led to the collapse of the economy and vast underinvestment in infrastructure. The situation is compounded by international sanctions on Zimbabwean individuals and institutions, which are potential obstacles to loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Dr. Magombeyi, the former doctors’ union head, provoked widespread horror this week when he shared an image on social media of what he said were the corpses of seven stillborn infants at a single hospital in Harare. Citing doctors at the hospital, Dr. Magombeyi said that the seven had all died on the same night, after a staffing shortage caused delays to their mothers’ prenatal care. Stagnant wages and rampant inflation have made basic medicines unaffordable to most patients. In June, the annual inflation rate was more than 700 percent, devaluing salaries and making common household goods beyond the reach of many citizens. Since the end of Mr. Mugabe’s rule, which was itself marked by profound economic upheaval, the cost of a loaf of bread has risen roughly 70-fold, turning it from a staple into a luxury. In recent months, the country’s electricity crisis has ebbed: Most households no longer face daily power outages, partly because the coronavirus restrictions have caused a drop in demand. But Zimbabweans still face daily water shortages. Parts of Harare receive running water only once or twice a week, forcing many to line up for hours at wells, springs and streams. Against this backdrop, Mr. Mnangagwa caused further anger this week by announcing a plan to raise $3.5 billion through government bond sales to compensate white farmers who were violently expelled from their land under Mr. Mugabe. But there has been no similarly ambitious plan to finance improvements to the health system or water infrastructure. “We have suffered enough,” said Denis Chengeto, a 55-year-old unemployed teacher, speaking ahead of the protests on Thursday. “We have a government that doesn’t care.” But after the government locked down the city on Friday, Mr. Chengeto said he was now too frightened to protest. “Nobody may hear my voice today,” he said on Friday. “I know soldiers won’t hesitate to shoot at anyone if we go on the streets.” Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare; and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.']","Three years after the fall of the strongman Robert Mugabe, the country is in free fall and his successor is clamping down by arresting opposition activists — including an author just nominated for the Booker Prize."
Polish Towns That Declared Themselves ‘L.G.B.T. Free’ Are Denied E.U. Funds,2020-07-30,By Monika Pronczuk,"['BRUSSELS — The European Union will not provide funding to six Polish towns that have declared themselves “L.G.B.T.-free zones,” a rare financial sanction of a member nation for issues related to the equal treatment of its citizens. While the amounts of money being withheld are modest — from $6,000 to $29,000 — the exclusion of the towns from funding for a program that connects local communities across Europe was intended to have a deeper symbolic resonance. “E.U. values and fundamental rights must be respected by Member States and state authorities,” Helena Dalli, the European Union commissioner for equality, wrote on Twitter. The Polish authorities that adopted “L.G.B.T.-free zones” or “family rights” resolutions failed to protect those rights, she wrote, and their funding applications had therefore been rejected. The decision comes just days after the leaders of the 27-nation European Union bowed to pressure from Poland and Hungary and relaxed a framework devised to tie long-term budget spending by the bloc to issues related to rule of law. Both countries, to different degrees, have steadily chipped away at some of the bedrock institutions that allow for a healthy democracy, including a free press and a judicial system free of political influence. But even as Poland and Hungary have caused increasing consternation in Brussels — both countries have been threatened with having their voting rights in the bloc suspended — they have faced little in the way of concrete punishments. Even by the often brutal standards of Polish politics, however, the demonization of gay men and lesbians by government officials over the past two years has been ferocious. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the governing party, has repeatedly told supporters that Poles will not be forced “to stand under the rainbow flag.” He has said that homosexuality represents a “threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state.” It has been a campaign amplified by state television, which has been turned into a propaganda arm of the government, and by prominent members of the Catholic clergy. Nearly 100 local governments, representing a third of Poland’s territory, declared themselves “free from L.G.B.T. ideology.” Although the declarations do not have legal force, they are viewed by many as menacing. And the heated rhetoric has been blamed for violence against gay men and lesbians. When marchers tried to take part in a gay pride parade in the conservative city of Bialystok last summer, opponents threw bricks, stones and fireworks at them. Some protesters were attacked and as the violent clashes escalated, with dozens wounded, the police had to deploy tear gas. A few months later, in December, the European Parliament condemned discrimination against the L.G.B.T.Q. community and called on the government to take action to revoke the declarations by local authorities. Nothing was done. During Poland’s recent presidential election in July, the governing party once again targeted gay men, lesbians and transsexuals. President Andrzej Duda said “L.G.B.T. ideology” was more dangerous than communist doctrine and he made it the central issue of his campaign. He narrowly won a second term, but the close fight and divisive rhetoric polarized Polish society even further. And the anti-L.G.B.T. invective has come at a cost. According to a 2020 survey by ILGA, an international gay rights organization, Poland is now the most homophobic country in the European Union. Some Western European municipalities, such as St.-Jean-de-Braye in the north-central French region of Loiret, have already suspended cooperation with towns they were twinned with in Poland that declared themselves “L.G.B.T. free.” The Polish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on Wednesday that the funding decision was “unfounded and unlawful,” arguing that European institutions should respect the national identities of all member countries. Mr. Ziobro denounced the European Commission, saying that some of its members were “ideologically obstinate” and wanted to impose “the agenda of homosexual activists” on others. But Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, which distributes European Union funding, defended the decision to reject sending money to the Polish towns. “Our treaties ensure that every person in Europe is free to be who they are, live where they like, love who they want, and aim as high as they want,” she said in a statement on Thursday. “I will continue to push for a union of equality.”']","The governing party in Poland has attacked L.G.B.T. people, using homophobic rhetoric that European officials say has led to unequal treatment."
A Cool Trudeau Rebuffs Conflict Charges. Will Canadians Buy His Story?,2020-07-30,By Catherine Porter,"['TORONTO — There was no corruption, no conflict of interest, just a government and prime minister working around the clock to save lives and livelihoods during a pandemic. That was Justin Trudeau’s message on Thursday to Canadians, who for the past month have lifted their heads from the exhausting struggle with the coronavirus to watch a growing political scandal over his government’s decision to award a hefty no-bid contract to a charity that has ties with his family. “Nothing of this program was in any way going to benefit any members of my family,” the prime minister said during a rare virtual appearance before the standing finance committee of the Canadian Parliament. “I was not in a conflict of interest.” The highly anticipated session, which stretched for 90 minutes, had elements of drama — heated exchanges, baiting questions and even a power outage during a storm over the chairman’s home. But Mr. Trudeau predictably kept his cool, displaying his well-honed political talents. The contract, made to the WE Charity, was to oversee hundreds of millions of government dollars for an emergency summer youth volunteer program. Mr. Trudeau defended the decision to give the charity the contract by presenting himself as a longtime champion of youths. And he said he was following the advice of public servants to start a program that, like others his government has set up, would help thousands of people across the country. “We moved quickly to try to get help out to people as fast as we could as flexibly as we could,” Mr. Trudeau said.  The question is: Was his performance enough to persuade Canadians that he did nothing wrong and put to rest thorny ethical questions that have set the media ablaze for the past month and dragged down his party’s polling numbers? The WE Charity is tied not only to Mr. Trudeau’s family, but also to his finance minister, Bill Morneau. Mr. Trudeau’s mother and brother earned more than $200,000 over the past five years for speaking engagements with the charity. Mr. Morneau’s daughter works there, and his family has traveled overseas with the charity twice in recent years. Both Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau have apologized for not recusing themselves from the cabinet decision. Both are under investigation by the country’s ethics commissioner. But during Thursday’s testimony, Mr. Trudeau reinforced what others have said before him — that officials of Canada’s apolitical public service chose the charity and that his cabinet was given a “binary choice” of either agreeing to the plan, or having to abandon it altogether. The perception of a conflict with his family, he added, caused him to put the decision on hold for two weeks and push the public service to “make sure that everything was done exactly right, because I knew there would be questions asked.” Lori Turnbull, director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax was among the rapt viewers who blocked off hours to see the unfolding testimonies. “He got his message out — you want the Liberals to be there to take care of you when a crisis like this hits,” she said, referring to Mr. Trudeau’s party. “To me, the prime minister left this meeting as a youth champion who made a little error.” Still, the prime minister has already been found in breach of the country’s conflict-of-interest rules twice since coming to office five years ago. That he acknowledged a perceived conflict but did not recuse himself raises troubling questions about his political judgment, said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian nonprofit polling firm based in Vancouver. “In some ways, I think he did very well,” Ms. Kurl said. “But it doesn’t fix other problems. Now, we have to assess to what extent these ongoing examples of the prime minister not having good judgment will become a ballot question.” The story has unfolded since late June, when the Trudeau government announced that it had awarded the job of administering the summer program, and its budget of 912 million Canadian dollars, to the WE Charity. Two brothers, Craig and Marc Kielburger, founded the charity as teenagers. Since then, it has grown into a network of organizations that have built schools and wells in countries like Kenya and Nicaragua. But it is best known for inspiring young Canadians to get involved in social justice issues through school programs and huge concert-like events featuring motivational speakers, including Prince Harry, Malala Yousafzai, Mr. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau. The charity says the Trudeaus volunteered their time and were never paid, with one exception in 2012, when Ms. Gregoire Trudeau received about $1,000 for a speaking engagement. Mr. Trudeau was not prime minister at the time. Since then, Ms. Gregoire Trudeau has become an “ambassador” of the charity, speaking regularly at events and hosting a podcast called WE Well-being. Mr. Trudeau said Thursday that the country’s ethics commissioner had vetted these roles. But the WE Charity did pay Mr. Trudeau’s brother Alexandre, a filmmaker, and mother, Margaret, the country’s former first lady, for speaking over the past four years on behalf of the charity at various events. The Kielburger brothers said attracting sponsors for these events was their main way of raising money. On Thursday, Mr. Trudeau said he did not have a personal relationship with the Kielburger brothers and had no contact with them about this contract. In recent days, witnesses before the committee bolstered what Mr. Trudeau said Thursday — that he was not involved in selecting the charity to administer the program, which involved overseeing up to 100,000 students volunteering for public service jobs.  WE was to have received as much as 43.5 million Canadian dollars to run the program, according to documents released this week. But after the controversy erupted, the government announced it was taking the program back, and the Kielburgers said they would return all the money. The program is still on hold. Hours before Mr. Morneau, the finance minister, was set to testify last week before the committee, he announced he had written a check to the charity for 41,366 Canadian dollars, stating that he hadn’t realized he and his family had not paid the full fare for the two trips they took with the organization. He also disclosed that his family had donated 100,000 Canadian dollars to the charity in recent years. “You don’t donate $100,000, take trips with a charity and have a daughter who works there and not know there’s a conflict of interest,” said Duff Conacher, the co-founder of a nonprofit watchdog organization, Democracy Watch, which is calling for a criminal investigation. “This is a story about how every government has friends, those friends help them get elected and promote them, and then the government wants to help those friends because they will promote and boost them more,” he said. The committee has not heard any evidence that Mr. Trudeau stood to financially benefit from the contract, several political experts pointed out. If there has been any damage, it has been in optics. “Technically speaking, he didn’t need to recuse himself, in my opinion,” said Ian Stedman, a professor of Canadian public law and governance at York University in Toronto, and an expert on Canadian parliamentary ethics law. But, he added: “But pragmatically speaking, what he did was bad politics. He allowed himself to be the story, instead of his policies.” Canadians have been generally happy with the Trudeau government’s handling of the coronavirus epidemic, which has leveled off across the country, allowing hairdressers and restaurants in most places to reopen and plans for school openings to be drafted. But in recent weeks, since news about the charity has continually made the front pages, Mr. Trudeau’s approval rating has fallen. It is unclear whether that is a blip or the start of a trend. “People have concerns about this, but they have so many other issues right now,” said Jean-Marc Léger, the chief executive of the Léger polling firm based in Montreal. “They are worried about the pandemic, the economic crisis, relations with the United States.” The Kielburger brothers maintain they would have made no profit from the contract. Because of the intense scrutiny over the past few weeks, many big sponsors have cut ties with WE — the organization has called the decisions mutual — and former staff members have poured out stories on social media about the charity’s “culture of fear.” Craig Kielburger said the unfolding controversy might “destroy” the organization. “Frankly, there are days that we wish that we never answered the phone,” when the government called asking them “to help,” he told the committee near the grueling end of the brothers’ four-hour appearance earlier this week.

Belarus Says Russian Mercenaries Planned to Disrupt August Election,2020-07-29,By Andrew Higgins,"['MOSCOW — Escalating a simmering feud with Russia, its neighbor and longtime ally, Belarus on Wednesday charged that more than 200 mercenaries from Russia, disguised as tourists, had infiltrated Belarus on a mission to disrupt its presidential election. Reports of a Russian mercenary force in Belarus, which could not be independently confirmed, followed months of increasingly ill-tempered exchanges between Minsk and Moscow, close but fractious allies that used to be bound together by their shared wariness of the West, but are now intensely wary of each other. The news reinforced a narrative promoted in recent weeks by President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, who has ruled with an iron fist for 26 years, that widespread public discontent stemmed from foreign meddling, not his own unpopularity. Mr. Lukashenko has a long record of blaming foreigners for his troubles but has only recently turned his propaganda machine on Russia, rather than Western powers like the United States, previously his favorite target. Belta, Belarus’s official news agency, published the names and birth dates of 32 detained Russian fighters whom it described as employees of Wagner Group, a mercenary recruiting company linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The Russian embassy in Minsk said it had asked the Belarusian authorities about the reports of a mercenary force but had received no official information about any Russians being detained. Russia has long been Belarus’s closest ally and principal benefactor, and the two nations are bound together by language, similar political systems and a shared reverence for many aspects of the Soviet Union. But relations have soured dramatically as President Putin has pushed Mr. Lukashenko to implement a long-stalled plan to form a “union state,” effectively a merger of the two countries in which Russia, with 15 times as many people as Belarus, would be very much the senior partner. Mr. Lukashenko, who has a reputation for erratic behavior and wild claims, announced on Tuesday that he had been infected by the coronavirus but had fully recovered without treatment. That announcement was greeted with skepticism, as it played into his longstanding position that the pandemic poses no serious danger to public health and can be kept at bay by drinking vodka, riding tractors and playing ice hockey. In June, Mr. Lukashenko had two would-be rival candidates in Belarus’s Aug. 9 presidential elections arrested on corruption charges, claiming that he had thwarted a plot to foment revolution by Russian interests. On Wednesday, the government released video footage of a nighttime raid this week on a sanitarium near Minsk, where 32 Russian fighters were arrested; another one was arrested in a different part of the country. The video featured heavily armed officers from Belarus’s security service — still called, as in Soviet days, the K.G.B. — storming into guest rooms occupied by the alleged mercenaries. It showed a number of beefy Russians in handcuffs, one of them lying on the floor in boxer briefs, Russian passports and a stack of $100 bills. But belongings seized in the raid also included bank notes and telephone cards from Sudan and texts written in Arabic, which suggested the arrested Russians may have been en route to or from North Africa, rather than on a mission targeting Belarus. The arrested Russians, according to a report by Belta, aroused suspicion as soon as they arrived in Belarus because they had three heavy suitcases, wore military-style clothing and behaved in ways “uncharacteristic for Russian tourists,” shunning alcohol and avoiding night clubs. Wagner Group, the mercenary outfit accused of employing the men, has sent fighters, mostly veterans of Russia’s armed forces, to Syria, Libya, Sudan and various other countries. According to United States officials, it is controlled by Mr. Prigozhin, known as “Putin’s chef” because of his success in winning catering contracts from the Russian military. He has been indicted in the United States over meddling in the 2016 American presidential election by another of his ventures, the troll farm in St. Petersburg formally known as the Internet Research Agency. He has repeatedly denied any links to Wagner or to interference in the U.S. election. Zakhar Prilepin, a Russian writer who fought in eastern Ukraine in support of a separatist rebellion fomented and armed by Moscow, told Russian media on Wednesday that he recognized several of the arrested men shown by Belarusian television as veterans of his former unit in Donetsk, a Russian-speaking Ukrainian region that declared itself an independent, pro-Russian state in 2014. While the men may have been in Belarus, he said, they were probably headed to a mission elsewhere. Similarly, a social media channel run by a Russian war correspondent and often used by Russian mercenaries said the arrested Russians were most likely passing through Belarus on their way to conflict zones in Africa where Wagner fighters have been heavily involved in combat operations. President Lukashenko, however, painted Belarus as the target of the mercenary force and called an emergency meeting on Wednesday of his security council to discuss the Russian threat. Belta news agency quoted him as saying he had ordered the head of the Belarus K.G.B. to ask Russia “what is happening?” Such talk, critics say, is an attempt at distraction, as Mr. Lukashenko faces growing domestic opposition. Riot police units have intervened repeatedly and brutally to halt street protests in Minsk and other cities across the country since the arrests in June of two popular would-be candidates. A third prospective candidate, Belarus’s former ambassador to Washington, fled to Russia last week to avoid arrest. After the arrest of his strongest potential rival, Viktor Babariko, the former head of a Russian-owned bank, Mr. Lukashenko claimed that he had foiled a plot orchestrated from Moscow to overthrow his government. That claim was widely dismissed by independent observers as a clumsy attempt to rally Western support for his pre-election crackdown. The news that alleged Russian mercenaries had been arrested broke just hours after Mr. Lukashenko visited a Belarus military base, where he boasted to a gathering of army and riot police officers of his work to rebuild the country’s security and defense apparatus after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. “Nobody gave us anything, and we owe nothing to anyone,” he told the officers in an apparent snub to Russia, which has provided weapons and training to Belarus for years. Long adept at maneuvering between Russia and the West to extract political and economic favors, Mr. Lukashenko has increasingly tilted away from Moscow in recent months, particularly since a visit to Minsk in February by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. After that visit, the first by a secretary of state since the early 1990s, Washington appointed its first ambassador to Belarus in more than a decade and both countries pledged to improve their previously frozen relations.

Latin America Is Facing a ‘Decline of Democracy’ Under the Pandemic,2020-07-29,By Anatoly Kurmanaev,"['CARACAS, Venezuela — Postponed elections. Sidelined courts. A persecuted opposition. As the coronavirus pandemic tears through Latin America and the Caribbean, killing more than 180,000 and destroying the livelihoods of tens of millions in the region, it is also undermining democratic norms that were already under strain. Leaders ranging from the center-right to the far left have used the crisis as justification to extend their time in office, weaken oversight of government actions and silence critics — actions that under different circumstances would be described as authoritarian and antidemocratic but that now are being billed as lifesaving measures to curb the spread of the disease. The gradual undermining of democratic rules during an economic crisis and public health catastrophe could leave Latin America primed for slower growth and an increase in corruption and human rights abuses, experts warned. This is particularly true in places where political rights and accountability were already in steep decline. “It’s not a matter of left or right, it’s a general decline of democracy across the region,” said Alessandra Pinna, a Latin America researcher at Freedom House, an independent Washington-based research organization that measures global political liberties. There are now five Latin American and Caribbean nations with recent democratic histories  — Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guyana, Bolivia and Haiti — where governments weren’t chosen in free and fair elections or have overstayed their time in office. It’s the highest number since the late 1980s, when the Cold War receded and several countries in the grips of civil war or military dictatorships transitioned to peace and democracy. Most of these leaders were already bending the rules of democracy to stay in power before the pandemic, but seized on emergency conditions created by the spread of the virus to strengthen their position. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has detained or raided the homes of dozens of journalists, social activists and opposition leaders for questioning the government’s dubious coronavirus figures. In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega released thousands of inmates because of the threat posed by the virus, but kept political prisoners behind bars, while in Guyana, a lockdown prevented protests against the government’s attempt to stay in power despite losing an election. In Bolivia, a caretaker government has used the pandemic to postpone elections, tap into emergency aid to bolster its electoral campaign and threaten to ban the main opposition candidate from running. And in the islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, the government imposed a strict lockdown on its 50,000 people during the campaign for general elections in June, hampering opposition efforts to meet voters while also keeping international election observers from traveling to the country. It was the first time that the Organization of American States, a regional group that promotes democracy, had its invitation to observe elections withdrawn by a host country in recent history. The loss of public trust in Latin America is not new, but the erosion of democratic norms in the pandemic arrived at a time when the region’s economic growth and social progress were already unraveling, leaving many uncertain about the ability of democratic leaders to solve entrenched problems such as inequality, crime and corruption. By 2018, only one in four Latin Americans said they were satisfied with democracy — the lowest number since Latinobarómetro, a regional polling company, began asking that question 25 years ago. Discontent with the political establishment led to a wave of populist victories in recent years, including President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who is on the far right, and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, who is on the left. It also led to mass street protests in several Latin American countries last year. The pandemic, hitting during this time of political upheaval, has plunged the region into the deepest recession in its history, exacerbating weaknesses in health and welfare systems and highlighting the ways in which many leaders are unable to meet public demands. “All the things that Latin Americans have already been clamoring for — greater equality, better services — have been dramatically worsened by the pandemic,” said Cynthia Arnson, Latin America program director at the Wilson Center, a think-tank in Washington. “The economic pain is dramatic, and it’s putting additional strain on the already-weak institutions.” It has also put a strain on the region’s struggling health care systems. Latin America has become a global hot spot for the virus, with Brazil, Mexico and Peru among the 10 nations with the highest number of deaths. And according to the United Nations, about 16 million Latin Americans are expected to fall into extreme poverty this year, reversing nearly all the gains made by the region this century. Adding to these challenges, democracy in Latin America has also lost a champion in the United States, which had played an important role in promoting democracy after the end of the Cold War by financing good governance programs and calling out authoritarian abuses. Under President Trump, the United States has mostly focused regional policy on opposing left-wing autocrats in Venezuela and Cuba and curbing immigration, making aid to Central American nations, among the region’s poorest, contingent on cooperating with the administration on immigration. The Trump administration also refrained from commenting when Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, ignored Supreme Court rulings and used the military to crack down on quarantine violators during the pandemic. American support for democracy initiatives in Latin America fell by almost half last year to $326 million, according to preliminary figures compiled by the United States Agency for International Development. “In the last few years, we have not only abandoned our role as a democratizing force in Latin America and the world, but we have promoted negative forces,” said Orlando Pérez, a political scientist at the University of North Texas. “Our policy is now: ‘You’re on your own — America first.’” In the few democratic strongholds in Latin America, such as Uruguay and Costa Rica, leaders responded to the pandemic with efficiency and transparency, boosting public trust in the government. In the Dominican Republic and Suriname, incumbent presidents recently bowed out of power after losing elections that were held despite the pandemic. In many instances, judges and civil servants have resisted the attacks on democratic institutions during the pandemic, said Javier Corrales, a professor of Latin American studies at Amherst College in Massachusetts. “The defenders of liberal democracy in Latin America are not defeated,” said Mr. Corrales. “It’s not an open terrain for would-be authoritarians.” Yet in most Latin American nations, the coronavirus accelerated a pre-existing democratic decline by exposing the weakness and corruption of governments in the face of the catastrophe. “When confronted with an existential threat, countries that did not already have deep democratic systems are choosing tactics that help leaders consolidate their power,” said John Polga-Hecimovich, a political scientist at the United States Naval Academy in Maryland. The political tensions gripping the region in the pandemic could be just the beginning of a longer wave of unrest and authoritarianism, said Thomas Carothers, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It will drag the region down into poorer economic performance,” he said. “It also means poorer treatment of human beings, their dignity and rights.” Natalie Kitroeff contributed reporting from Mexico City.

"U.K. Has Europe’s Worst Surge in Deaths During Pandemic, Study Says",2020-07-30,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — England has had the greatest rate of excess deaths of any country in Europe during the coronavirus pandemic, with a surge that lasted longer and spread to more places than those in hard-hit nations like Italy and Spain, according to a government report released on Thursday. The findings, in a report by Britain’s Office of National Statistics, painted a grim picture of how Britain — and England in particular — weathered the first wave of the pandemic. They came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson spotlighted the struggles of other countries in controlling new infections by moving to put more of them under a travel quarantine. Critics said Mr. Johnson was trying to deflect attention from his own dilatory initial response to the pandemic, which they said had left the country as vulnerable to a resurgence as its neighbors. When Britain’s death toll from the virus first surpassed those of other European countries in May, Mr. Johnson argued that country-to-country comparisons were invidious because governments collect and analyze data differently. But the statistics office said it avoided those pitfalls by examining mortality rates across Europe from all causes — not just those attributed to Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus — from January to June, and then comparing them to average figures from 2015 to 2019. That takes into account Covid-19 deaths that were not labeled as such, and deaths indirectly related to the pandemic, like those from a lack of access to hospitals during lockdowns. Demographers believe tracking excess mortality is the most accurate gauge of deaths during the pandemic. There are some major holes in the data, not least a lack of statistics from Germany, Western Europe’s most populous country and one that has performed better than most in keeping down infections and fatalities. The report also does not provide raw numbers of excess deaths for each country, but rather a relative measure of the rate of deaths above the historical average, adjusted for factors like age differences. The statistics office has separately estimated that the United Kingdom suffered 55,763 excess deaths from March 14, when the virus began circulating in the country, through July 17. A New York Times analysis puts excess deaths in Britain at 62,600 over the same period, by far the most in Europe and a 31 percent increase in mortality for that time of year. The British report confirms the harrowing images of overwhelmed hospitals in Italy and Spain in March and April. At their peak, deaths in parts of Spain and Italy surged much more than anywhere in Britain, spiking to 9½ times the usual rate in mid-March in Bergamo, in Northern Italy, an early epicenter. In England, where the local increases were not as steep, the biggest jump was to 4½ times normal in mid-April in Brent, a borough of London. Birmingham had the highest peak for a major British city, at 3½ times the average of recent years. But the death rate for Britain as a whole was elevated longer than in Spain or Italy, and the increase spread to every corner of the country. “Excess mortality was geographically widespread throughout the U.K. during the pandemic, whereas it was more geographically localized in most countries of Western Europe,” said Edward Morgan, an expert in health analysis and life events at the Office for National Statistics. For most European countries, the death rate spiraled in late March and early April. During the last week of March, the worst across Europe with 33,000 excess deaths, Spain alone registered over 12,500 more fatalities than would be expected when compared with data from 2016 to 2019, and Italy over 6,500 more, according a second study, by the French national statistics agency, INSEE. All told, Italy has reported 35,129 Covid-19 deaths and Spain has reported 28,441, but the Times analysis puts excess deaths at more than 44,000 in each of those countries. The British report focused primarily on England rather than the entire United Kingdom because, it said, the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland administer their own health policies, often with different results. England, the largest part of Britain, has recorded much sharper increases in death rates during the pandemic than the others. Public health experts have attributed Britain’s high toll in part to the timing of Mr. Johnson’s lockdown, which came a week after those in Italy and Spain. The government abandoned a program of mass testing and contact tracing in early March, depriving it of data on how fast the virus had circulated in the population. Mr. Johnson’s messaging may have played an inadvertent role. Worried about the National Health Service being overrun, as hospitals in Italy had been, the prime minister urged people to “Stay at home” and “Protect the N.H.S.” The British public took that to heart and hospitals coped well with the flood of patients, one of the pandemic’s few bright spots. But experts said that some sick people who should have gone to the hospital stayed home — and at least some of them died of cancer, heart disease or other illnesses. “‘Protect the N.H.S.’ became interpreted as ‘Stay away from the N.H.S.,’” said Devi Sridhar, chair of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. That could help explain one of the intriguing disparities in the report, she said. It showed that in London, which was hard hit by the virus, there was little difference in the excess death rate for people over the age of 65 and those under 65. In Madrid and Barcelona, by contrast, there was a huge disparity between those over 65 and the rest of the population, which is consistent with a disease that is more lethal to the elderly. Manchester and Birmingham also showed an age disparity, though somewhat less pronounced. Professor Sridhar argued that England should adopt a policy of driving new infections down to zero, similar to that of the government in Scotland. With such a policy in place, she said, it would make sense for the government to screen incoming travelers and impose strict quarantines where necessary. “Otherwise,” she said, “given the high level of cases in the community, it might be seen as pre-empting blame for a second wave to Europe.” Last weekend, British officials added Spain to a list of countries from which travelers have to isolate themselves for 14 days. Now they are monitoring France, Belgium and Croatia, where there have been fresh outbreaks. Mr. Johnson said he was determined to stop a second wave of infections imported by British vacationers. The rapidly changing policy has played havoc with the holiday plans of thousands and drawn criticism from the Spanish government and flagging tourism businesses. “We think it’s a big diversion from the government’s failure to handle this in a more sensible way,” said Steven Freudmann, the chairman of the Institute of Travel and Tourism, an industry lobbying group. “The risk actually is greater staying at home than it is going to many of these countries.” Elian Peltier contributed reporting.']",Prime Minister Boris Johnson has linked Britain’s high toll to record-keeping variances among nations. But a government report shows deaths really have been higher than in neighboring countries.
"Border Clashes With Pakistan Leave 15 Afghan Civilians Dead, Officials Say",2020-07-31,By Taimoor Shah and Mujib Mashal,"['KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — Some of the most intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent years left at least 15 civilians dead on the Afghan side on Thursday, officials said. Afghanistan accused Pakistani forces of firing heavy artillery into civilian areas after protests by communities on both sides who were demanding the reopening of a nearby border crossing that Pakistan had closed to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Hayatullah Hayat, the governor of Kandahar Province, where the clashes occurred, said the worst barrage of Pakistani artillery started around 7 p.m. and struck the Spin Boldak area. In addition to the deaths, at least 80 other civilians were wounded, he said. Afghan security officials said they had retaliated with rockets. Social media videos apparently filmed from the Pakistani side showed the dark sky lit up by intense crossfire. A delegation from the local Pakistani government in Baluchistan Province had arrived at the border to assess the situation, officials in Pakistan said. Gen. Yasin Zia, the chief of Afghanistan’s army, has ordered the three army corps stationed along the border areas to be “fully ready to retaliate to the Pakistani military in kind” and put his country’s special forces and air force on the “highest alert,” Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. The ministry estimated the number of dead at nine, including a child. Movement across the porous border had been restricted by the Pakistani side in recent months over concern about the pandemic, which has hit both countries hard. The restrictions particularly affected communities on two sides of the Chaman crossing, people who rely on easy border trade, either as laborers or smugglers, for a living. For several weeks, protesters had staged a sit-in on the Pakistani side of the crossing in Chaman demanding the resumption of normal flow. In June, Pakistan reopened for commercial trucks, but the crossing remained shut for travelers and laborers. The border was opened for travelers stuck on the two sides on Wednesday, but the protest to allow the routine crossing of laborers had continued. The situation grew tense on the Pakistani side on Thursday, with reports of Pakistani forces opening fire on protesters during clashes and killing at least two people. The protesters torched a Covid-19 quarantine facility. When thousands of travelers stuck on the Afghan side rushed for the crossing in the chaos, they were met by Pakistani fire that also struck Afghan border police facilities. The situation erupted into full-on clashes that intensified late into the night, witnesses said. Adeel Ahmad, a provincial official in Baluchistan, said Pakistani security forces had denied they targeted civilians and had only fired shots into the air to disperse protesters and maintain order. “The daily wage workers, especially, who work on both sides of the border are most hard-pressed and have demanded from the government to lift the restrictions on movement and economic activity,” Mr. Ahmed said. “The locals say that we can no longer tolerate hunger and unemployment and want a solution to the current impasse. The locals are also resisting the government’s plans to introduce passport and biometric systems for cross-border movement.” Afghan officials and residents in Spin Boldak District said heavy artillery fire from the Pakistani side forced hundreds of families to flee their homes from border villages last night. The clashes at the southern border came just a week after Afghan officials said Pakistani forces had fired dozens of mortar shells into the Sarkano District of eastern Kunar Province, killing eight civilians. The two countries share a long border, about 1,500 miles, that was drawn by the British in the 19th century and that left ethnic Pashtun tribes split. Consecutive Afghan governments have questioned the legitimacy of the division, known as the Durand Line, as an official border. Efforts by Pakistan’s government to build reinforced fences and security checkpoints along the border have angered Afghan officials and communities in the area. Taimoor Shah reported from Kandahar and Mujib Mashal from Kabul, Afghanistan. Reporting was contributed by Salman Masood in Islamabad, Pakistan, and Fahim Abed in Kabul, Afghanistan.']","Anger over the closing of the border because of coronavirus fears triggered demonstrations, and then artillery barrages."
"The Dictator Who Waged War on Darfur Is Gone, but the Killing Goes On",2020-07-30,By Declan Walsh,"['CAIRO — On camels, horses and motorbikes, dozens of Arab militiamen stormed into the remote village in Darfur, in western Sudan, firing wildly, witnesses said. Houses were pillaged, animals stolen and water tanks smashed. Villagers ran for their lives. United Nations peacekeepers scrambled to the scene but said they found the road blocked by obstacles placed in their way, and continued on foot. When they arrived after two and a half hours, it was too late. At least nine people lay dead, including a 15-year-old boy, and another 20 were seriously wounded, according to the United Nations. The attack in Fata Bornu, a remote hamlet of 4,000 people, echoes the grimmest days of the Darfur conflict in the 2000s. But it happened just this month — over a year since euphoric protests toppled Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the detested dictator whose alleged atrocities in Darfur earned him an indictment on genocide charges in an international court. Now Mr. al-Bashir languishes in jail and Sudan is run by a joint civilian-military government that has promised to usher in a new era of democracy, and finally — after 17 years of suffering — bring peace to Darfur. But while the revolution brought some change to Sudan’s cities, that is not the case in Darfur, where the notorious janjaweed — nomadic Arab militias — still ride free. Heavily armed gangs continue to massacre, plunder and rape in scorched-earth tactics that recall the worst days of Mr. al-Bashir’s rule. And the Sudanese military has faced accusations of negligence, as in Fata Bornu, or even being complicit. “They stand silent in front of the janjaweed attacks,” said Adam Mohamed, a senior leader of Darfur’s displaced community, in a telephone interview. “They do nothing.” The tempo of violence quickened in recent days with another 60 civilians massacred on Saturday in an assault by about 500 Arab militiamen, according to the United Nations — the deadliest attack in months. Two days earlier, 15 people were killed in a different part of Darfur, local news media reported. After Saturday’s massacre, in Masteri village in West Darfur state, Sudan’s civilian prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, promised to send the police and army reinforcements “to protect citizens and the farming season.” But distrust of the security forces runs high in Darfur, where the military has an ignominious history of manipulating, and frequently directing, ethnic violence, according to human rights groups. “When you see attacks like this one, and it’s just another Tuesday in Darfur, you realize that not much has changed since the revolution,” said Cameron Hudson, a former State Department official and Sudan expert at the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, a research group, speaking of the attack on Fata Bornu. While Sudan’s dictator has been vanquished, his legacy has proved harder to dismantle, and the transition to democracy has stalled perilously in key areas. A transitional legislature, announced last year, has yet to be formed. The youthful democracy campaigners who helped to oust Mr. al-Bashir have split into factions. A campaign to get the United States to lift its designation of Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism, which perpetuates Sudan’s pariah status and blocks foreign investment, has run into sand. And the country’s transitional government, which is supposed to pave the way for a general election in 2022, is troubled by tensions between military and civilian leaders, Western diplomats say, as well as periodic rumors of a military coup. Young Darfuris were at the forefront of last year’s uprising, when some were arrested and tortured by Mr. al-Bashir’s security forces. Their high profile fueled their expectations that the revolution might bring radical change to Darfur. But the dynamic of the conflict remains the same. The war in Darfur erupted in 2003 when Darfuri rebels, angered by longstanding discrimination against the region’s non-Arab population, rose up against the government. Mr. al-Bashir hit back by arming the janjaweed, who killed thousands of civilians monthly at the height of the war, in attacks that the International Criminal Court has classified as genocide. The United Nations estimates that at least 300,000 people have died in a conflict that decreased in recent years, but never stopped. Since the ouster of Mr. al-Bashir in April of 2019, one of the most powerful figures in the new government, to the dismay of many Darfuris, has been Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, a commander whose Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries have been linked to atrocities in Darfur. Mr. Hamdan is now part of a government-led effort to negotiate peace with two Darfuri rebel groups. But many Darfuris see the talks as little more than window-dressing because the largest rebel group, led by a former lawyer, Abdul Wahid al Nur, has spurned them. The escalating crisis comes just as the international community is shifting attention away from Sudan. The United Nations peacekeeping mission to Darfur, formed in 2007, is expected to shut down by the end of the year. And Western governments have slashed their aid budgets for Sudan, even as the pandemic plunges the country deeper into poverty. Some\xa09.6 million people urgently need food aid, the most ever for Sudan, according to the United Nations. Foreign officials, eager to prop up Sudan’s shaky transition to democracy, appear to be reluctant to point blame at its fledgling government when trouble erupts in Darfur. After the attack on Fata Bornu on July 13, the United Nations peacekeeping mission, which is run jointly with the African Union, framed the violence as a seasonal dispute between herders and pastoralists. “The farming seasons in Darfur have witnessed such occurrences in the past,” it said in a statement. The top U.S. State Department official for Africa, Tibor Nagy, reinforced that narrative a day later with praise on Twitter for cooperation between Sudanese security forces and United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur. But internal United Nations reports reviewed by The New York Times, as well as interviews with Darfuri tribal leaders and United Nations officials, paint a different picture. The villagers, mostly people displaced by earlier fighting, had been protesting for two weeks before the attack. They demanded the resignation of the local governor, Maj. Gen. Malik Al-Tayeb Khojaly, accusing him of siding with the local Arab community. On July 12, General Khojaly responded to the villagers’ demands by withdrawing security from the area, villagers told United Nations officials. The Arab militiamen, who were at least 100 strong, attacked the next morning. The United Nations peacekeepers, mostly from Senegal, heard gunfire and saw plumes of smoke as they approached the camp. When a contingent of at least 130 peacekeepers finally arrived, they found terrified villagers huddled outside a school or hiding in the bushes. It was unclear if Sudanese troops had stood aside to allow the attack to take place, but an internal United Nations report pointedly noted their absence. “None of the GoS security forces were on the ground to defend the IDPs,” it said, using shorthand for the Sudanese government and internally displaced people. A spokesman for the Khartoum government did not respond to requests for comment. An official delegation visited Fata Bornu and promised to investigate the attack. Ashraf Eissa, a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeepers, said the mission was “doing its best” to protect civilians in the parts of Darfur where it still deployed. Since 2018, the mission has closed bases across Darfur and reduced its strength to 6,500 peacekeepers, down from 19,500. “This is a mission in exit mode,” he said. Beyond Darfur, last year’s revolution has brought some significant changes to Sudan. Mr. al-Bashir’s once-powerful Islamist party has been dissolved and Mr. Hamdok, a mild-mannered technocrat, has introduced a raft of modernizing legal reforms. Female genital cutting has been outlawed. Women can no longer be arrested for wearing clothing deemed insufficiently modest, and flogging has been abolished for all lawbreakers. The apostasy laws have been scrapped, Christians are allowed to consume alcohol, and any citizen can leave Sudan without an exit visa. Gay sex is no longer punishable by the death penalty, though it is still subject to a seven-year jail sentence. And Mr. al-Bashir, 76, is behind bars. Sentenced to two years imprisonment for corruption in December, the deposed autocrat reappeared in court last week to face separate charges over the 1989 military coup that catapulted him to power. If convicted, he faces the death penalty. On June 30, frustration with the slow pace of change prompted giant street protests across Sudan, the first since last year. “Freedom, peace and justice,” chanted the crowds, echoing a slogan of the anti-Bashir movement. One of the protests took place in Fata Bornu. But many other Darfuris, abandoning their dreams of change, have fled to Libya to try the perilous sea crossing to Europe, or have ended up in refugee camps in neighboring Chad. “The Khartoum government is telling them to be patient,” said Jérôme Tubiana, co-author of a recent report on the exodus for the Small Arms Survey, a research institute in Switzerland. “But they don’t trust them.

Lawmakers ‘Alarmed’ by Reports U.S. Envoy Told Brazil It Could Help Re-elect Trump,2020-07-31,"By Ernesto Londoño, Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Friday they were “extremely alarmed” by assertions that the American ambassador in Brazil had signaled to Brazilian officials they could help get President Trump re-elected by changing their trade policies. In a letter sent Friday afternoon, Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel demanded that the ambassador, Todd Chapman, produce “any and all documents referring or related to any discussions” he has held with Brazilian officials in recent weeks about their nation’s tariffs on ethanol, an important agricultural export for Iowa, a potential swing state in the American presidential election. The committee’s letter was sent in response to reports in the Brazilian news media this week saying that Mr. Chapman, a career diplomat, made it clear to Brazilian officials they could bolster Mr. Trump’s electoral chances in Iowa if Brazil lifted its ethanol tariffs. Eliminating tariffs would give the Trump administration a welcome trade victory to present to struggling ethanol producers in Iowa, where the president is in a close race with his Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr. The House committee said it was opening an inquiry into the matter. The State Department said Friday afternoon in an emailed statement that “allegations suggesting that Ambassador Chapman has asked Brazilians to support a specific U.S. candidate are false.” The statement added: “The United States has long been focused on reducing tariff barriers and will continue do so.” The O Globo newspaper published a story on Thursday saying Mr. Chapman had underscored “the importance to the Brazilian government of keeping Donald Trump” in office. Mr. Bolsonaro, a far-right leader, has made closer alignment with the Trump administration his top foreign policy priority. A competing newspaper, Estadão, published an article Friday saying its reporters independently confirmed that the ambassador framed his argument against tariffs in partisan terms. The article said the Brazilian officials who met with Mr. Chapman rejected the appeal, declining to be drawn into the American presidential battle. Neither article named its sources. But Alceu Moreira, a Brazilian congressman who heads the agricultural caucus, told The New York Times in an interview that Mr. Chapman had made repeated references to the electoral calendar during a recent meeting the two had about ethanol. He said that Mr. Chapman did not explicitly urge him to help the Trump campaign or bring up the contest in Iowa — but that the American ambassador did tie the ethanol issue to the election. “He said, ‘You know, we have elections in the United States, and that this is very important,’” Mr. Moreira said, recounting their conversation. “He said this four or five times.” In the letter, Mr. Engel said that if Mr. Chapman had pressured the Brazilians to help the Trump campaign, it could be a violation of the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that bars federal officials from engaging in certain partisan activities. “These statements are completely inappropriate for a U.S. ambassador to make,” Mr. Engel, a Democrat from New York, wrote in the letter, which was also signed by Representative Albio Sires, who chairs the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Civilian Security and Trade. The letter called on Mr. Chapman to “reassure Congress and the American people that our Ambassador to Brazil is truly representing the interests of the United States and not the narrow, political interests of President Trump."" Promoting favorable terms for American industries abroad is a core priority for American ambassadors. But American diplomats are reminded in election years to steer clear of any actions that might reasonably be construed as partisan. The committee’s letter also took issue with Mr. Chapman’s defense of a video promoting the Trump campaign that Eduardo Bolsonaro, a federal lawmaker and a son of President Jair Bolsonaro, posted Sunday on Twitter. The video ends with a slide that says “Trump 2020: The Great Victory.” Asked about the video in an interview with O Globo, Mr. Chapman said he saw no problem with Eduardo Bolsonaro’s endorsement. “I’m a big defender of freedom of expression,” Mr. Chapman told the newspaper. “And everyone is free to say who they like and who they’re against as they see fit; I’m not going to tell someone they can’t speak in favor or against my president.” Mr. Engel and Mr. Sires, a Democrat from New Jersey, said the ambassador should have responded differently. “While Mr. Bolsonaro has the right to speak freely, it is simply not appropriate for sitting government officials — in any branch of government — to promote the campaigns of candidates in the United States,” the congressmen wrote. “We frankly believe that you should know better.” Eduardo Bolsonaro is the rare Brazilian official who has openly supported lowering ethanol tariffs for American sellers. In a video he posted last September, he said taking a hit on ethanol would be a boon for Brazilian exporters of meat and sugar by improving the chances of a free-trade agreement between the two countries. “That could bring so many benefits to us as Brazilians,” said the younger Mr. Bolsonaro, an ardent supporter of Mr. Trump who wore a “Make Brazil Great Again” baseball cap during a visit to the White House last year. The United States has long pushed Brazil to lower tariffs on ethanol. Those talks gained a new sense of urgency in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic led to plummeting demand, and American ethanol sellers were squeezed by the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. Currently, American ethanol companies can sell up to 750 million liters of ethanol to Brazil per year without paying tariffs. Any sales beyond that are subject to a 20 percent tax. The Brazilian government raised the tariff-free cap last September from 600 million liters — a gesture intended to give Brazilian sugar producers greater access to the American market. Mr. Trump hailed that move, calling it “great progress for our Farmers.” But Washington did not make good on the sugar access, which left the Brazilians feeling embittered. The current ethanol tariff framework is set to expire in August. If the two countries don’t reach a deal, Brazil will apply a 20 percent tax to all ethanol imports, a blow to an industry that is pleading for government bailouts. Mr. Moreira, the Brazilian congressman who heads the agricultural caucus, said he told Mr. Chapman that Brazilian politicians also had political considerations to consider, given coming municipal elections in November. Ethanol producers in Brazil’s northeast states would look dimly on tariff rules that put them at a competitive disadvantage. “Is the ethanol producer very important electorally speaking? Yes, very important,” Mr. Moreira said. “We very much like the American people, but we like our people more.” Congressman Arnaldo Jardim, who leads a Brazilian congressional bloc that supports ethanol producers, said Mr. Chapman has been negotiating with a sense of urgency as the deadline approaches. “Let’s just say he’s putting pressure” on Brazilian officials, said Mr. Jardim, adding that he had not personally met with the ambassador about this issue, but regularly speaks to several officials who have. “He’s saying that this is paramount for the United States and paramount for Trump.” Orlando Ribeiro, who heads the department of commercial and international relations at Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, said that negotiators had hoped to reach a deal on ethanol tariffs before the August deadline that took into account the interests of all stakeholders. Barring that, he said he feared Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro could hash out a deal over the phone at the last minute. “What could happen is that on the eve, Trump could call Bolsonaro and they might decide to lift all” tariffs, he said.']",The House Foreign Affairs Committee has begun an inquiry into multiple reports in the Brazilian media that the U.S. ambassador was framing negotiations over ethanol tariffs in partisan terms.
How Italy Turned Around Its Coronavirus Calamity,2020-07-31,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — When the coronavirus erupted in the West, Italy was the nightmarish epicenter, a place to avoid at all costs and a shorthand in the United States and much of Europe for uncontrolled contagion. “You look at what’s going on with Italy,” President Trump told reporters on March 17. “We don’t want to be in a position like that.” Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, used Italy’s overwhelmed hospitals as evidence for his opposition to Medicare for All at a presidential debate. “It is not working in Italy right now,” he said. Fast forward a few months, and the United States has suffered tens of thousands more deaths than any country in the world. European states that once looked smugly at Italy are facing new flare-ups. Some are imposing fresh restrictions and weighing whether to lock down again. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Friday announced a delay to a planned easing of measures in England as the infection rate there rose. Even Germany, lauded for its efficient response and rigorous contact tracing, has warned that lax behavior is prompting a surge in cases. And Italy? Its hospitals are basically empty of Covid-19 patients. Daily deaths attributed to the virus in Lombardy, the northern region that bore the brunt of the pandemic, hover around zero. The number of new daily cases has plummeted to “one of the lowest in Europe and the world,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the National Institute of Health. “We have been very prudent.” And lucky. Today, despite a tiny uptick in cases this week, Italians are cautiously optimistic that they have the virus in check — even as Italy’s leading health experts warn that complacency remains the jet fuel of the pandemic. They are aware that the picture can change at any moment. How Italy has gone from being a global pariah to a model — however imperfect — of viral containment holds fresh lessons for the rest of the world, including the United States, where the virus, never under control, now rages across the country. After a stumbling start, Italy has consolidated, or at least maintained, the rewards of a tough nationwide lockdown through a mix of vigilance and painfully gained medical expertise. Its government has been guided by scientific and technical committees. Local doctors, hospitals and health officials collect more than 20 indicators on the virus daily and send them to regional authorities, who then forward them to the National Institute of Health. The result is a weekly X-ray of the country’s health upon which policy decisions are based. That is a long way from the state of panic, and near collapse, that hit Italy in March. This week, Parliament voted to extend the government’s emergency powers through Oct. 15 after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte argued the nation could not let its guard down “because the virus is still circulating.” Those powers allow the government to keep restrictions in place and respond quickly — including with lockdowns — to any new clusters. The government has already imposed travel restrictions on more than a dozen countries to Italy, as the importation of the virus from countries is now the government’s greatest fear. “There are a lot of situations in France, Spain, the Balkans, which means that the virus is not off at all,” said Ranieri Guerra, assistant director general for strategic initiatives at the World Health Organization and an Italian doctor. “It can come back at any time.” There is no doubt that the privations of the lockdown were economically costly. For three months, businesses and restaurants were ordered closed, movement was highly restricted — even between regions, towns and streets — and tourism ground to a halt. Italy is expected to lose about 10 percent of its gross domestic product this year. But at a certain point, as the virus threatened to spread uncontrollably, Italian officials decided to put lives ahead of the economy. “The health of the Italian people comes and will always come first,” Mr. Conte said at the time. Italian officials now hope that the worst of the cure came in one large dose — the painful lockdown — and that the country is now safe to resume normal life, albeit with limits. They argue that the only way to start up the economy is to keep tamping down the virus, even now. The strategy of closing down completely invited criticism that the government’s excessive caution was paralyzing the economy. But it may prove to be more advantageous than trying to reopen the economy while the virus still rages, as is happening in countries like the United States, Brazil and Mexico. That does not mean that calls for continued vigilance, as elsewhere in the world, have been immune to mockery, resistance and exasperation. In that, Italy is no different. Masks often are missing or lowered in trains or buses, where they are mandatory. Young people are going out and doing the things young people do — and risk in that way spreading the virus to more susceptible parts of the population. Adults started gathering at the beach and for birthday barbecues. There is still no clear plan for a return to school in September. There is also a burgeoning, and politically motivated, anti-mask contingent led by nationalist Matteo Salvini, who on July 27 declared that replacing handshakes and hugs with elbow bumps was “the end of the human species.” At his rallies, Mr. Salvini, the leader of the populist League party, still shakes hands and wears his mask like a chin guard. In July, during a news conference, he accused the Italian government of “importing” infected immigrants to create new clusters and extend the state of emergency. This week, Mr. Salvini joined other mask skeptics — nicknamed the “negationists” by critics — for a protest in the Senate library, along with special guests such as the Italian crooner Andrea Bocelli, who said he did not believe the pandemic was so serious because “I know a lot of people and I don’t know anyone who ended up in an I.C.U.” But the country’s leading health experts say that the lack of severe cases is indicative of a decrease in the volume of infections, as only a small percentage of the infected get very sick. And so far, Italy’s malcontents have not been numerous or powerful enough to undermine what has been a hard-won trajectory of success in confronting the virus after a calamitous start. Italy’s initial isolation by European neighbors at the outset of the crisis, when masks and ventilators were hardly pouring in from across the borders, may actually have helped, Mr. Guerra, the W.H.O. expert, said. “There was competition initially, there was no collaboration,” Mr. Guerra said. “And everyone acknowledged Italy was left alone at that time.” As a result, he said, “what they had to do at that time because we were left alone turned out to be more effective than other countries.” Italy first quarantined towns and then the Lombardy region in the north and then the entire peninsula and its islands, despite the near absence of the virus in much of central and southern Italy. That not only prevented workers in the industrial north from returning home in the much more vulnerable south, but it also fostered and forced a unified national response. During the lockdown, movement was strictly limited, between regions and towns and even city blocks, and people had to fill in “auto-certification” forms to prove that they needed to go outside for work, health or “other necessities.” Masks and social distancing regulations were enforced by some regional authorities with steep fines. Generally, if grudgingly, the rules were followed. As searing scenes of human suffering, empty streets and the heavy toll on an elderly generation of northern Italians spread, the transmission rate of the virus quickly decreased, and the curve flattened, as opposed to other European countries, such as Sweden, which pursued an alternative to locking down. That the initial outbreak was localized in the overwhelmed hospitals created enormous stress, but it also enabled doctors and nurses to expedite contact tracing. Then the country reopened, gradually, expanding liberties at two-week intervals to respond to the virus’s incubation period. The lockdown eventually had a secondary effect of decreasing the volume of virus circulating in society, and thus reducing the probability of coming in contact with someone who had it. At the end of the lockdown, the virus circulation had steeply fallen off and in some central and southern regions, there were hardly any chains of transmission at all. “It’s always a matter of probability with these pathogens,” said Mr. Guerra, adding that new early alarm systems such as the monitoring of wastewater for traces of virus had lowered the probability of infection even more. Some Italian doctors say they believe that the virus is now behaving differently in Italy. Matteo Bassetti, an infectious-disease doctor in the northwestern city of Genoa, said that during the height of the crisis, his hospital was inundated with 500 Covid-19 cases at one time. Now, he said, his intensive care unit, with 50 beds, has no coronavirus patients, and the 60-bed Covid-19 unit built specially for the crisis is empty. He said he thought that the virus had weakened — an unproven view, he acknowledged, that has nonetheless found an eager audience in Mr. Salvini and other politicians opposed to extending the state of emergency. Most health experts said that the virus still loomed, and as the government considers a new decree to reopen night clubs, festivals and cruise ship travel, many of them have implored the country not to let down its guard. “Even if the situation is better than in other countries, we should continue to be very prudent,” said Dr. Rezza of the National Institute of Health, adding that he thought the question of what Italy had done right was better posed “at the end of the epidemic.” “We cannot exclude that we will have outbreaks in Italy in the next few days,” he said. “Maybe it’s just a matter of time.” Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Milan.']","After a stumbling start, the country has gone from being a global pariah to a model — however imperfect — of viral containment that holds lessons for its neighbors and for the United States."
American Accused of Blasphemy Is Killed in Pakistan Courtroom,2020-07-30,By Salman Masood,"['The United States urged Pakistan on Thursday to overhaul the country’s harsh blasphemy laws a day after an American citizen accused of violating them was fatally shot in a courtroom. The brazen killing has brought into sharp focus Pakistan’s much-maligned blasphemy laws, which critics say are often used to persecute and intimidate members of religious minorities. The American, Tahir Ahmad Naseem, 57, was on trial in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar on charges that he had claimed to be a prophet. Mr. Naseem was shot six times on Wednesday by a young man whom the authorities identified only as Faisal, 19, a local resident. The killing, in a courtroom at the Peshawar Judicial Complex, drew strong condemnation from the U.S. government. “We extend our condolences to the family of Tahir Naseem, the American citizen who was killed today inside a courtroom in Pakistan,” the State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said in a Twitter post on Thursday. “We urge Pakistan to take immediate action and pursue reforms that will prevent such a shameful tragedy from happening again.” Mr. Naseem was accused of blasphemy in 2018 on charges that carried penalties ranging from fines to death. He had been a member of the Ahmadi sect, which has been declared heretical under the Pakistani Constitution and whose members face repeated persecution. However, representatives said Mr. Naseem had left the sect and had claimed to be the messiah and a prophet. Blasphemy is a highly combustible and sensitive subject in Pakistan, with emotions flaring over mere rumors that Islam has been insulted. The government has never executed anyone under blasphemy laws, but people accused of it are often killed by mobs even before the police can take action, rights groups say. Soon after the killing of Mr. Naseem, a video of the gunman was widely shared on social media. It showed him sitting on a courtroom bench while being held by police officers, and he is heard saying the Prophet Muhammad told him in a dream to kill Mr. Naseem. “He is an enemy of Islam,” the gunman is heard saying of Mr. Naseem. “He is an enemy of Pakistan.” Police officials said they were investigating how the attacker managed to bring a gun inside the high-security court compound. Rights activists and rights groups have long campaigned against the blasphemy laws, saying they are used to oppress religious minorities and to settle personal feuds. But hard-line Islamic religious parties have bitterly opposed moves to amend the laws. Mainstream political leaders acknowledge the misuse of the blasphemy laws, but have mostly caved in to the pressures by religious parties not to change them and have dithered in taking a public stand against them. In 2011, Salmaan Taseer, a prominent politician who was then the governor of Punjab Province, had campaigned to change the blasphemy laws, but was fatally shot by his police guard. Mr. Taseer had been campaigning for the release of Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death and imprisoned for eight years after being accused of blasphemy. The Supreme Court overturned her conviction in 2018, and she now lives in Canada. The killing of Mr. Taseer was a chilling reminder of the dangers that outspoken secular politicians face in a deeply conservative and religious Pakistani society.']","The shooting of Tahir Ahmad Naseem drew strong U.S. condemnation of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, which are often used to persecute and intimidate religious minorities."
"Judge Blocks Green Card Wealth Tests, Citing Pandemic Hardships",2020-07-29,,"['Read our live Coronavirus pandemic coverage here.  A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with plans to deny green cards to immigrants who have received Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers, even on a limited basis — a wealth test that several states, led by New York, sued over during the coronavirus pandemic. The judge, George B. Daniels of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, granted a nationwide temporary injunction, suspending the eligibility requirements that were introduced last year and that drew several legal challenges, including before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in January that the Trump administration could move forward with the plan, but that was before the pandemic. President Trump has sought an expansion of the requirements, but critics argued that they could have a chilling effect for legal immigrants who needed medical treatment or financial aid during the pandemic. Judge Daniels wrote that the policy “fails to measure up to the gravity of this global pandemic that continues to threaten the lives and economic well-being of America’s residents.” “No person should hesitate to seek medical care, nor should they endure punishment or penalty if they seek temporary financial aid as a result of the pandemic’s impact,” he added. Attorney General Letitia James of New York, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday, “This is a major victory to protect the health of our communities across New York and the entire nation.”  It was the latest immigration clash between Democrats and the Trump administration, which was thwarted by the Supreme Court last month from ending a program protecting about 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. This month, the administration walked back a plan to strip visas from international students who took only online classes at universities or colleges. California and Florida on Wednesday reported single-day records for deaths, as a number of other states moved to reimpose restrictions to cope with soaring caseloads. California recorded more than 185 deaths, along with a record number of new cases, more than 12,300, according to a New York Times database.  Florida reported more than 216 deaths, surpassing its previous high of 186, which was recorded on Tuesday.  In Hawaii, which set a  single-day record with 109 new cases, Gov. David Ige said he would seek to limit social gatherings to 10 people after officials noted large gatherings in parks and beaches. He said he was also asking mayors to consider closing bars. “I’m very much concerned with what’s happening,” Mr. Ige said. “It is a dropping of our vigilance.” Rhode Island said it would lower the limit on social gatherings from 25 people to 15 after officials there tracked cases back to a number of large gatherings, including a house party with more than 50 people and a baby shower.  “We are partying too much,” Gov. Gina Raimondo said.  Beginning on Friday, people in Maryland will be required to wear masks in all public buildings, not just in stores and on public transit, as well as  in all places outdoors where social distancing is not possible. In Michigan, officials said they would reduce the number of people who can attend indoor social gatherings to 10 and would close bars for indoor service. Even as the state imposed that restriction, however, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she would allow Detroit’s casinos to open on Aug. 5, though at only 15 percent capacity. A $600-a-week federal unemployment benefit that has helped keep tens of millions of Americans afloat as the pandemic upended the economy is likely to lapse as scheduled on Friday, a top White House official said Wednesday, as the prospects for a quick compromise between Democrats and the Trump administration on a new round of aid sank further. “We’re nowhere close to a deal,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, told reporters after leaving talks with top Democrats in the office of Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. “It means enhanced unemployment insurance provisions will expire.” Democrats want to extend the full benefit through January, while Republicans in the Senate have called for scaling it back to $200 per week. Earlier in the day, President Trump indicated that he did not care about the fate of a broad economic recovery package that lawmakers in both parties, along with members of his own administration, are scrambling to put together before tens of millions of Americans formally lose their jobless benefits on Friday, telling reporters he would rather see a narrow package. “You work on the payments for the people,” Mr. Trump said, referring to another round of direct payments, “and the rest of it — we’re so far apart, we don’t care.” “We really don’t care,” Mr. Trump added. Mr. Trump suggested that he wanted to renew a federal moratorium on evictions that expired earlier this month for millions of Americans, saying, “We want to stop the evictions.” But the Republican proposal his administration helped draft has no measure to do so. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary,  and Mr. Meadows are expected to huddle with Senate Republicans during their weekly policy lunch and meet for the third consecutive day with Ms. Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, later Wednesday afternoon. Democrats have so far rejected the prospect of a narrow package, insisting on a comprehensive package, and Mr. Trump has dismissed the Republican package as “semi-irrelevant.” On Wednesday, he slammed Republicans for distancing themselves from his efforts to secure funding for a new F.B.I. headquarters in Washington as part of the recovery package, saying that, “Republicans should go back to school and learn.” Key Data of the day Back in April, the United States’ leading authority on infectious diseases expressed hope that no more than 60,000 people in the U.S. would die from the virus. A few weeks later a major research center predicted that the figure would be just over 70,000 people by early August. In May, the president said that between 75,000 and 100,000 people might die. On Wednesday, the nation’s death toll surpassed 150,000, according to a New York Times database. That the figure has soared so fast and so far beyond those estimates illustrates how difficult it can be to accurately forecast the spread of the virus, or to predict the way citizens and politicians will respond to it. “The aspect which is really impossible to predict is human behavior,” said Virginia Pitzer, a professor of epidemiology at Yale. “To what extent are people going to socially distance themselves? To what extent are politics going to influence whether you wear a mask? All of these factors are impossible to factor in.” About 1,000 virus-related deaths a day have been reported over the past week, the worst rate since early June, when the number of fatalities seemed to be falling. Now, daily death counts are rising in 23 states and Puerto Rico. The first virus-related death in the U.S. was reported in February. The nation passed the 50,000 mark on April 27 and 100,000 deaths on May 27, a milestone The Times commemorated by filling its front page with names of the dead. As of Wednesday evening, at least 150,909 people were known to have died of the virus in the U.S., out of more than 4.4 million reported infections. And even these figures are likely to be undercounts, experts say. EDUCATION ROUNDUP The Miami-Dade County, Fla., public school system said Wednesday that it would delay the start of the school year by a week to Aug. 31, and that schools would initially open online only. Alberto M. Carvalho, the superintendent, said he hoped to open schools for in-person instruction on Oct. 5 if virus conditions had improved enough by then. Miami-Dade is the latest large school district to opt for remote learning, even as Mr. Trump has pushed for in-person instruction and sought to withhold some federal funding from schools that go online.  Districts in Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix,  suburban Washington and elsewhere have all decided it is not yet safe to return to in-person instruction. The Miami-Dade school district is the fourth largest in the nation and the largest in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has pushed hard for students to attend brick-and-mortar schools next month. A few hours before Mr. Carvalho’s announcement in Miami, Mr. DeSantis visited a school in Clearwater, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, to promote school reopenings. Earlier this month the education commissioner,  Richard Corcoran, issued an emergency order requiring schools to open. After a teachers’ union sued, Mr. DeSantis said districts could delay the start of the school year if needed. Several have done so. “Every parent needs to have a choice about their kid’s education, whether they want to continue with distance learning — I think that’s the parents’ right — or whether they would like that in-person instruction, because I know a lot of students really need that,” Mr. DeSantis said. But Mr. Carvalho said even a hybrid model, with some students going to school and others learning online, would not be feasible with the virus so prevalent in Miami-Dade. Here are other developments in education: Researchers have estimated that the states’ decisions to close schools last spring probably saved tens of thousands of lives and prevented many more infections. Still, the authors acknowledged that their findings are not broadly applicable today, and  experts caution that  the findings highlighted a period when few precautions were in place. A Times survey of every public four-year college in the country, as well as every private institution that competes in Division I sports or is a member of an elite group of research universities, revealed at least 6,300 cases tied to about 270 colleges over the course of the pandemic. And the new academic year has not yet begun at most schools. Alabama said Wednesday that in addition to school employees, students in second grade through college must also wear masks. U.S. Roundup The Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero on Wednesday and pledged to keep supporting the United States economy as the pandemic continues to depress economic growth and sideline millions of workers. “The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,” the central bank said in its post-meeting statement. “The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference following the meeting that the pace of the economic recovery was “far from certain” given the uncertainty surrounding the virus, which has surged in certain spots around the country. While employment ticked up in May and June, recent up-to-date labor market data show signs of slowing as efforts to slow infection weigh on activity again, Mr. Powell said. He also predicted a long slog ahead for workers in certain sectors of the economy, even once the economy reopens more fully, particularly those that involve “lots of people getting together in close proximity” like restaurants, bars, hotels and other places. “There won’t be enough jobs for them,” he said. “There will be a need both for more support from us and for more fiscal policy.”  Here’s a look at other developments around the U.S.: Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said that restaurant employees and patrons would be required to wear masks beginning Monday. He also said that more businesses — including concert venues, theaters, stadiums, arenas and gymnasiums — would be allowed to operate beginning Monday as long as they follow certain restrictions, including limiting capacity to 50 percent of occupancy or 250 people, whichever is less. Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has frequently refused to don a face covering in the Capitol, confirmed on Wednesday that he had tested positive ahead of a planned trip with President Trump on Air Force One. Hours later, Speaker Pelosi  announced a new mandate requiring lawmakers and staff  to wear masks on the House floor, on penalty of removal. Mr. Gohmert has  participated in congressional hearings this week, including Tuesday’s Judiciary Committee session with Attorney General William P. Barr, during which he did not wear a mask.  He said he was not experiencing symptoms.  Florida, which is in the grip of a serious outbreak, announced that all state-supported drive-through and walk-up testing sites would close Thursday at 5 p.m. because a major storm is forecast. Officials noted that tents at the test sites would not be able to withstand tropical storm force winds. Sites are expected to reopen by Wednesday at the latest. In a move long sought by advocates, California has stepped up its efforts to track whether the virus is affecting L.G.B.T.Q. people at disproportionate rates. State health officials announced Tuesday that health care providers and labs would be required to collect and report to the state data that patients give voluntarily about their gender identity and sexual orientation, in addition to their age and ethnicity. GLOBAL ROUNDUP After roughly 100 days without any confirmed cases of local transmission, a coronavirus outbreak has struck Vietnam. And it’s rapidly spreading in the nation of 95 million people. The surge of the virus in the country, which has so far recorded fewer than 450 cases, demonstrates the dangers of the virus even in the places that appeared to have done almost everything right. Japan, China, Australia and South Korea, all of which seemed to have their outbreaks reasonably under control, recorded spikes on Wednesday. The health ministry in Vietnam said that the strain of virus detected in the coastal city of Danang was different from ones that circulated during an earlier round of local transmission, suggesting that virus was imported. Both medical experts and residents are spooked by the surge. “This outbreak is more dangerous than the previous one because it is happening at the same time in many places,” said Nguyen Huy Nga, the dean of public health and nursing at Quang Trung University in Binh Dinh Province. “We do not know the source.” Hours after clusters of cases were confirmed in Danang hospitals this week, officials said they would be shutting the city’s airport. Up to 80,000 local tourists who had traveled to the city would be evacuated, the authorities said. Vietnam is the largest country in the world without a single confirmed death from the virus. Here are other developments from around the globe: A union representing FedEx pilots called on the delivery company on Tuesday to suspend operations in Hong Kong after its members were subjected to quarantine facilities under “extremely difficult conditions.” Ashleigh Barty, the top-ranked women’s singles player, has confirmed that she will not play in the United States Open  in New York because of concerns about traveling during the pandemic. ”I don’t feel comfortable putting my team and I in that position.,” Barty, an Australian, said. The Open is still set to begin on Aug. 31. The last time the tournament was held without the top women’s singles player was 2010, when Serena Williams withdrew because of a foot injury.  Across the Middle East, celebrations for Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice that marks the end of the hajj this weekend, will be tamer this year. About 2.5 million Muslims from around the world performed the pilgrimage to Mecca last year. This year, Saudi Arabia said it would allow as few as 1,000 pilgrims, all from within the kingdom. The agriculture minister of Zimbabwe, Perrance Shiri, who led a military unit that massacred thousands of civilians during civil strife in the 1980s and helped plot the coup that overthrew the country’s longtime strongman leader, Robert Mugabe, in 2017, has died of coronavirus, according to local media reports. Mr. Shiri was 65 (an earlier version misstated his age), and was thought to have contracted the virus from his driver, who also died recently. Australia recorded its deadliest day since the pandemic began, with all 13 fatalities on Wednesday reported from the southern state of Victoria, which also had 723 new cases. A total of 21 new cases were recorded in other states, as the authorities tightened borders and local restrictions. Sending patients from hospitals to nursing homes to free up hospital beds early in the pandemic has been described as “reckless” by lawmakers in Britain, the BBC reports. The death toll in British care homes has been a defining scandal of the pandemic for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Drinkers in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, now must make reservations for seats on patios. The measure was introduced after Dr. Vera Etches, the city’s medical officer of health, expressed concern that a rise in cases among people in their 20s was partly related to long lines outside bars. In its battle to contain the coronavirus, Iran is facing tough decisions on how to proceed with coming marquee academic and religious events: the annual university entrance exam and a holy month of Shia mourning rituals. The university entrance exam, which ranks and matches students with universities and is known as “konkur,” usually takes place in June. But it was delayed because of the virus and millions of recent high school graduates remain in limbo, not knowing if they can attend college  this fall. Commemorating the holy month of Muharram, the first of the Islamic lunar calendar starting on Aug. 20 this year, and Shia Islam’s most important holiday, Ashura, which takes place during that month, has turned into another thorny issue for the government. Every year Iran stages grand religious ceremonies to honor the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad. The event is deeply rooted in Iranian culture and identity. Black banners drape street walls, and every neighborhood hosts nightly prayer gatherings in mosques or people’s homes. Thousands march in street processions and take part in charity food handouts. Health ministry officials sternly oppose holding either event, citing rising numbers of infections and deaths. “We are at the peak of this disease now in most of the provinces and especially Tehran,” said Dr. Minou Mohrez, the health ministry’s top infectious disease specialist and a member of the government’s coronavirus committee. “All public gatherings must be banned to the extent possible.” The government of President Hassan Rouhani, under pressure from religious and educational establishments, has pushed back on the idea of canceling the events, insisting that both will be held with health protocols observed. “We will not allow anyone to question these annual Muharram commemorations and blame them for the surge in Covid-19 cases,” Mr. Rouhani said on Wednesday. The chairman of the House select committee investigating the government’s coronavirus response is accusing the White House of suppressing its own dire state-by-state assessments of the virus’s spread and keeping science-based public health recommendations a secret as Mr. Trump insists the pandemic is under control. The chairman, Representative Jim Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, sent a letter Wednesday to the White House coronavirus task force, demanding that it make its internal assessments public. On Tuesday, The New York Times published the most recent task force report, which identified 21 “red zone” states and offered public health guidance like imposing statewide mask orders or close bars and gyms. (Read the letter to Vice President Mike Pence.) “We are primarily concerned right now with the difference that seems to be existing between what the White House is saying publicly and what it is saying and doing privately,” Mr. Clyburn said in an interview, adding, “Covid-19 is recognized by this White House as being much more serious in their private dealing with it.” Mr. Clyburn also sent letters to the Republican governors of four “red zone” states — Tennessee, Florida, Georgia and Oklahoma — asking them to produce internal correspondence with the administration, as well as proof that they are following the task force’s recommendations. The letter sent to the task force was addressed to Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator. “This unpublished report recommends far stronger public health measures than the Trump administration has called for in public — including requiring face masks, closing bars, and strictly limiting gatherings,” Mr. Clyburn wrote. “Yet many states do not appear to be following these unpublished recommendations and are instead pursuing policies more consistent with the administration’s contradictory public statements.” Mr. Clyburn does not have the power to compel the documents, unless he issues a subpoena — and even then, the Trump White House has ignored such legally binding requests. Mr. Clyburn stopped short of saying he would subpoena the documents, but his committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has broad authority to investigate the government’s response and will hear from three top health officials, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci at a hearing on Friday. Dr. Birx is not scheduled to testify. Only a few weeks into the rollout of New York City’s much-heralded contact-tracing program, which began on June 1 and was a vital initiative in the effort to contain the virus and to reopen the local economy, the newly hired contact tracers were already expressing growing misgivings about their work. The city’s new Test and Trace Corps hired about 3,000 contact tracers, case monitors and others. Some contact tracers described the program’s first six weeks as poorly run and disorganized, leaving them frustrated and fearful that their work would not have much of an impact. They spoke of a confusing training regimen and priorities, and of newly hired supervisors who were unable to provide guidance. They said computer problems had sometimes caused patient records to disappear. And they said their performances were being tracked by call-center-style “adherence scores” that monitor the length of coffee breaks but did not account for how well tracers were building trust with clients. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration acknowledged that the program had gotten off to a troubled start, but said that improvements had been made. “All signs indicate that the program has been effective in helping the city avoid the resurgence we’re seeing in other states,” Avery Cohen, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said. Elsewhere in New York: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo estimated on Wednesday that the state would be facing a $30 billion budget shortfall over the next two years — including $14 billion this year — if the federal relief aid bill does not include funding for state governments. He warned of possible 20 percent cuts in funding that would affect state agencies and aid to local governments, schools and hospitals. The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles will allow driving schools, starting on Wednesday, to conduct remote learning for pre-license driving courses, Mr. Cuomo said. Driving schools can hold courses over video chat programs like Zoom and Skype. Talking about money is always difficult, but new financial hardships may be hitting those closest to you, making these conversations all the more important. It doesn’t have to be awkward.

Scorching Temperatures Bake Middle East Amid Eid al-Adha Celebrations,2020-07-31,By Falih Hassan and Elian Peltier,"['BAGHDAD — A sweltering 125 degrees Fahrenheit in Baghdad on Tuesday; a record 115 degrees in Damascus on Wednesday. And extreme levels of heat in Israel and Lebanon. Several countries in the Middle East experienced record high temperatures this week as many marked the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha amid the coronavirus pandemic. The heat wave left cities sweltering in scorching temperatures of 120 degrees (48 degrees Celsius) or more for days, raising concerns it was a sign of future misery under the warming effects of climate change. Iraq has been hit especially hard, with Baghdad recording its all-time highest temperature on Tuesday, followed by its second hottest day on record on Wednesday. The southern city of Basra also recorded temperatures of 120 degrees and higher for days, with the mercury hitting 122 degrees on Thursday, a temperature also recorded in Amara, in the southeast. “The heat is unbearable,” said Ahmed Hashim, a 30-year-old Baghdad resident. “There’s a psychological pressure, people can easily get into a fight.” Mr. Hashim said he had seen people faint from the heat in the streets of the Iraqi capital. Some have tried to find respite from the scorching temperatures in public fountains. The heat wave is hitting Iraq as the country struggles with a worsening shortage of electricity, which has pushed people to rely even more on private generators to power refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans. Mr. Hashim said generators were being switched off every few hours because of power cuts, worsening the misery. “The cooler in the house cannot cool the rooms — electricity is a disaster,” he added. Two protesters were killed by security forces in Baghdad on Monday in demonstrations over the worsening lack of electricity. The killings were the first in months near Tahrir Square, which became a symbol of protests against endemic corruption and foreign interference last year during a monthslong period of unrest. On Thursday, Iraqi authorities ordered a nationwide eight-day holiday for Eid al-Adha to bring some relief across the country. Meteorologists define a heat wave as a prolonged period of unusually high temperatures that span across several days, usually three. Combined with high humidity or the lack of cool temperatures at night, extreme temperatures pose risks to the elderly and children. With average worldwide temperatures rising as a result of carbon dioxide emissions and other heat-trapping gases, periods of extreme heat are becoming more frequent and more intense, with the situation particularly dire near the Equator. But cooler regions have not been spared. Intense heat afflicted Europe this week, a year after extreme temperatures soared across the continent, and several cities like Paris and Glasgow recorded all-time high temperatures. And a study of a prolonged heat wave in Siberia earlier this year found that global warming made the extreme temperatures 600 times more likely there. Temperatures regularly go above 115 degrees in the summer in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Amman, Jordan; and Baghdad; 120-degree days are no longer exceptional. But meteorologists have warned that the current heat wave may be longer and more widespread across the region. A report about climate change in the Middle East published by the United Nations in 2017 estimated that average temperatures could increase nearly 10 degrees in certain areas of the region by the end of the century, and that the number of days over 104 degrees would increase significantly. The number of nights per year where temperatures remain above 68 degrees Fahrenheit may also jump from 40 to 80 or 90 by the end of the century in the region, said Paolo Ruti, a meteorologist and the director of the World Weather Research Program at the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency. At Houche al Oumara in Lebanon, temperatures rose to nearly 114 degrees — one of the hottest temperatures ever recorded in the country. Temperatures also soared across much of Israel this week, reaching 111 degrees at the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, and 103 in the northern city of Tiberias. Climate experts said the heat wave was part of a trend of warmer summer temperatures across Israel. “This heat wave didn’t break any records,” said Hadas Saaroni, a professor of climatology at Tel Aviv University. “But over the past three decades, we have witnessed higher temperatures as well as longer summers and heat waves.” Even as countries in the Middle East deal with the crippling heat, they are struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected hundreds of thousands of people in the region. In May, the World Meteorological Organization warned that the pandemic would increase health risks caused by high temperatures, forcing people to congregate indoors in air-conditioned public spaces, while leaving vulnerable people more exposed to heat stroke. In Saudi Arabia, where the temperature hit 115 degrees in its capital, Riyadh, the pandemic has pushed authorities to sharply reduce the number of pilgrims undertaking the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. In Iraq, Jowdat Abdul Rahman, a spokesman of the country’s civil defense forces, said the heat wave’s impact had been aggravated by the pandemic. “Iraqis used to go to swimming pools when temperatures would rise, while now, they can’t,” he said. And for the first time, he said, birds are dying because of the heat. “I had never seen such a thing before.” Falih Hassan reported from Baghdad, and Elian Peltier from London.

"In Indonesia, False Virus Cures Pushed by Those Who Should Know Better",2020-07-31,By Richard C. Paddock,"['First, Indonesia’s agriculture minister promoted wearing a necklace containing a eucalyptus potion to cure the coronavirus. Not to be outdone, the governor of Bali, a popular resort island, pushed his own remedy: inhaling the steam from boiled arak, a traditional alcohol made from coconuts. So-called influencers and self-styled experts have also pushed their own quack cures and misinformation on Indonesian social media, including a widely spread rumor that popular infrared thermometer guns cause brain damage. As Indonesia steadily loses ground to the pandemic, the government has had difficulty delivering a consistent, science-based message about the coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19. As of Friday, Indonesia had reported more than 108,000 cases and more than 5,130 deaths, surpassing China in both categories. Yet even in hard-hit provinces, as many as 70 percent of people go without masks and ignore social distancing requirements, according to the government, often crowding into shops and markets and hanging out at busy cafes and restaurants. Indonesia is not the only country battling misinformation or whose leaders have promoted quack remedies. The World Health Organization has called the ubiquity of hazardous false information an “infodemic.” In Kenya, the governor of Nairobi has pushed cognac as a miracle cure. President Trump has continued to promote hydroxychloroquine, a drug used for treating malaria, as a coronavirus remedy despite medical evidence to the contrary. He has even suggested that an “injection inside” the human body with a disinfectant like bleach could help combat the virus. But Indonesia is unique because of its large population, expansive geography across thousands of islands and mix of cultural identities. It would be difficult enough for the government to implement a clear and unified plan for combating the virus, but matters have been made worse by the promotion of muddled and often dangerous information. The country’s president, Joko Widodo, had initially downplayed the pandemic and has delivered mixed messages. He admitted in March that he had misled the public about the virus to prevent a panic. After that, he was slow to close businesses and schools and to limit travel, but was quick to lift restrictions even as cases continued to rise. In May, he said Indonesia should learn to live with the virus. A month later, however, he threatened to fire cabinet ministers for not doing more to bring the pandemic under control. This month, he called for a national campaign to promote better discipline in social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing. In the absence of a unified message from the national government, local officials and opportunists have filled the gap. One official who has promoted a questionable remedy is the agriculture minister, Syahrul Yasin Limpo. He told reporters this month that a ministry laboratory had developed a potion made from eucalyptus that when worn on a necklace could kill 80 percent of virus particles in half an hour. “From 700 species of eucalyptus, our lab test results showed that one kind could kill the corona,” he said. “We are certain. We will produce it next month.” His claim was quickly contradicted by health experts, including the head of the laboratory that developed the aromatic potion, who said it was not effective against the coronavirus. But that didn’t stop others from promoting it. A popular singer, Iis Dahlia, met with Mr. Joko as he sought to recruit celebrities to help in his health campaign. Soon after, she informed her 12 million Instagram followers that she was proud to be wearing the amulet. “This eucalyptus necklace,” she said, “makes me feel safe and protected from the virus.” In Bali, the governor, I Wayan Koster, has promoted a local treatment: inhaling the steam of boiled arak, a traditional alcoholic beverage. As if to stay on trend, he too recommends adding a dash of eucalyptus oil. The governor, who has a Ph.D. in education and described himself as a former “researcher,” told a news conference last week that nearly 80 percent of those who inhaled the concoction tested negative sooner than would have been expected. The treatment has not been subjected to scientific testing, but he said he hoped that Bali could patent and produce it. The government’s top coronavirus spokesman, Wiku Adisasmito, urged the public to follow health guidelines and not to rely on superstition and half-baked treatments, even when they emanate from public officials and celebrities. “At times of emergency, we all need honest, scientifically based, real facts to bring us hope, calm and clarity,” said Mr. Adisasmito, a University of Indonesia health policy professor. Jusuf Kalla, a former vice president who now heads the Indonesian Red Cross, said the country got off to a slow start in fighting the pandemic in part because the health minister, Terawan Agus Putranto, minimized its severity. “Until March, Minister Terawan was like Trump, saying, ‘Oh, this is only a simple flu,’” Mr. Kalla said. “But now, Minister Terawan is very realistic. Ministers and governors are trying to come up with solutions in an uncertain situation. It is trial and error.” Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, and some citizens and officials have leaned on their faith to promote cures and guide their understanding of the disease. On Lombok Island, a top official suggested that niqabs, loose Islamic veils worn by  women, were as effective in preventing the spread of the virus as snug-fitting medical face masks. “The advantage of the niqab is more ease in breathing,” Suhaili Fadhil Thohir, the regent of Central Lombok, explained in an interview. Nevertheless, the Covid task force for the province, West Nusa Tenggara, continues to call for face masks, said Artanto, a police spokesman and task force member. “The regent still wears a mask, not a niqab,” said Mr. Artanto, who like many Indonesians uses one name. “We keep educating people to wear a mask.” For many Muslims, the Covid-19 burial protocol of wrapping the body tightly in plastic and burying it in a designated cemetery has been difficult to accept. By tradition, Muslim family members wash the body of the deceased and wrap it in cloth for burial. The authorities say there have been many cases around the country of families rejecting doctors’ warnings and taking Covid-positive bodies home for burial. In Mataram, Lombok’s main city, relatives of a woman who died in a motorcycle accident this month refused to believe doctors who said she had tested positive. About 100 men stormed into Mataram’s government hospital to claim the body. Officers tried to explain the importance of the burial protocols. But they were badly outnumbered, and the men took the body, put it in a taxi and drove away. “It happens all over Indonesia,” Mr. Artanto said. “Their understanding as people who live in the village is different from those of us who live in the city.” Mr. Adisasmito said that Islamic burial traditions were deeply ingrained, and that it was hard for people to accept that they must change. He likened it to Americans who refuse to wear a mask because it obstructs their “pre-pandemic liberty, habits and way of life.” “We live in a diverse globe,” he said, “and different communities have distinctive values that they hold on to.” Muktita Suhartono and Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","In the absence of a unified message from the national government, local officials and opportunists have filled the gap with misinformation and quack remedies."
"Hong Kong Delays Election, Citing Coronavirus. The Opposition Isn’t Buying It.",2020-07-31,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — The Hong Kong government said on Friday that it would postpone the city’s September legislative election by one year because of the coronavirus pandemic, a decision seen by the pro-democracy opposition as a brazen attempt to thwart its electoral momentum and avoid the defeat of pro-Beijing candidates. “It is a really tough decision to delay, but we want to ensure fairness, public safety and public health,” said Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive. She cited the risk of infections, with as many as three million or more people expected to vote on the same day; the inability of candidates to hold campaign events due to social distancing rules; and the difficulties faced by eligible voters who are overseas or in mainland China and cannot return to cast ballots because of travel restrictions. The delay was a blow to opposition politicians, who had hoped to ride to victory in the fall on a wave of deep-seated dissatisfaction with the government and concerns about a sweeping new national security law imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong. And it was the latest in a quick series of aggressive moves by the pro-Beijing establishment that had the effect of sidelining the pro-democracy movement. On Thursday, 12 pro-democracy candidates said they had been barred from running, including four sitting lawmakers and several prominent activists like Joshua Wong. Mr. Wong said he was barred in part because of his criticism of the new security law.  “Clearly it is the largest election fraud in #HK’s history,” Mr. Wong wrote on Twitter after Mrs. Lam announced the postponement.  Even before Friday, the city’s pro-democracy opposition had accused the government of using social-distancing rules to clamp down on the protest movement that began more than a year ago. Earlier this week, amid reports that the vote might be delayed, Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy legislator running for re-election, said that China’s ruling Communist Party was ordering “a strategic retreat.” They “want to avoid a potential devastating defeat” in the election, he wrote on Twitter. The explanation that Hong Kong must delay the vote because of the pandemic is likely to fall flat among the wider public, said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “I think it will be seen as a kind of manipulation, that the government is afraid of losing the majority and that is why they postponed the election,” he said. Mrs. Lam denied that the decision had been influenced by political concerns. “It is purely on the basis of protecting the health and safety of the Hong Kong people and to ensure that the elections are held in a fair and open manner,” she said. While Hong Kong has been a world leader in controlling the coronavirus, in recent days it has seen its worst surge of infections yet, with more than 100 new cases reported daily for more than a week. The government has unfurled several new lockdown and social-distancing measures. “We face a dire situation in our fight against the virus,” Mrs. Lam said. Under Hong Kong law, an election can be delayed for up to 14 days if there is a “danger to public health or safety.” But Mrs. Lam postponed the election until Sept. 5, 2021, under emergency powers that allow the chief executive to make any regulations considered to be “desirable in the public interest.”  Those powers, which date to the British colonial era, were invoked last year when the government banned the wearing of masks in an effort to stem protests. China’s central government said it supported Mrs. Lam’s decision to delay the election, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.  Mrs. Lam acknowledged that the move created a “rather thorny issue” under the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution, which limits the terms of Legislative Council members to four years — meaning that the current lawmakers’ terms will soon expire.  That matter will be referred to the standing committee of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, which has the power to interpret the Basic Law, for a decision on how to deal with the gap, Xinhua reported.  The postponement will likely be met with criticism from the United States and other countries that have expressed sharp disapproval of China’s tightening grip on Hong Kong. This month, President Trump said that because of the national security law, the United States would begin to curb its special treatment of Hong Kong and deal with it more in line with the rest of China. The elections “must proceed on time,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday in a U.S. radio interview. “They must be held. The people of Hong Kong deserve to have their voice represented by the elected officials that they choose in those elections.” “If they destroy that, if they take that down, it will be another marker that will simply prove that the Chinese Communist Party has now made Hong Kong just another Communist-run city,” he added. Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Friday that the Hong Kong election was “a local election in China and is purely China’s internal affair.”  The national security law targets activity that it describes as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. It has stirred concerns in Hong Kong because it allows mainland security services to operate openly in the city and makes some speech, such as advocating Hong Kong’s independence, illegal. On Wednesday, in a sign that officials would strictly enforce the law, the police arrested four activists, ages 16 to 21, who were accused of supporting separatism in social media posts.  And the next day, in barring the 12 opposition candidates, the Hong Kong government said that the grounds for disqualifying them included advocating for Hong Kong’s independence or self-determination, soliciting intervention from foreign governments, expressing an objection in principle to the national security law Beijing imposed last month, or vowing to indiscriminately vote against government proposals. Opposition candidates say the moves suggested that pro-Beijing officials were concerned about a resounding defeat in the September election. Even establishment candidates have been quietly discussing the potential for a pan-democratic wave.  Elections for neighborhood-level offices, held last November, were seen as a warning: The opposition took control of 17 out of 18 district councils, which had normally been controlled by pro-Beijing parties. This year, the opposition set its sights on a bigger target: to take at least half the 70 seats in the Legislative Council, the top lawmaking body in the territory. While the protests have abated in recent weeks under the authorities’ crackdown, discontent with the government has remained strong since Beijing imposed the security law on Hong Kong, a semiautonomous city that maintains its own local government and legal system. Two weeks ago, more than 600,000 people participated in the opposition camp’s primary election, despite warnings from local officials that it might be illegal. Voters generally preferred candidates closely associated with the past year’s protests. In barring the candidates for the September elections, election officials questioned whether candidates who had previously lobbied foreign governments would continue to do so, which could potentially violate the new security law’s prohibitions on foreign influence. Another question asked was whether candidates, if elected, would veto the government’s budget. Under Hong Kong’s system, if the legislature blocks the budget twice in a row, the chief executive is forced to step down. Kwok Ka-ki, a legislator who was one of the 12 candidates disqualified Thursday, replied that such a question was political in nature, and that he was unsure why an election official had any business asking it. “After all, this is why there are elections in the first place,” he wrote. Just half the seats in the legislature represent geographic districts in Hong Kong, another barrier for the pro-democracy camp. The other half are functional constituencies largely set aside for candidates from various commercial sectors, which tend to vote for establishment candidates. The opposition has pointed to other places that have held successful elections during the pandemic, including South Korea and Singapore. “I don’t think many people in Hong Kong will be convinced,” Mr. Ma said, referring to the official justification for delaying the election. “They are allowed to go to work, take the subway, take the bus, stand in long queues and then not allowed to vote? It won’t be very convincing.” Elaine Yu and Tiffany May contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

"With Security Law as a Cudgel, Beijing Cracks Down on Hong Kong",2020-07-31,"By Keith Bradsher, Elaine Yu and Steven Lee Myers","['BEIJING — For weeks, as Beijing quickly drafted and imposed a stringent new national security law for Hong Kong, many in the territory feared the rules would be used to intimidate the opposition, but hoped they would not presage a broad crackdown. Now those hopes have been dashed. Brushing aside international criticism and sanctions, the Chinese government has used the letter and spirit of the law to crush Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition with surprising ferocity. In the last week alone, the authorities have ousted a tenured law professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been a key figure in the city’s democracy movement, and arrested four young activists on suspicion that they expressed support online for independence. They have also barred a dozen candidates from running for the legislature, using opposition to the security law as new ground for disqualification. On Friday, the authorities postponed for a year the election itself, which had been scheduled for Sept. 6. While they cited the coronavirus pandemic as justification for the move, it underscored Beijing’s fears that pro-democracy candidates could triumph. The breadth and severity of the actions reflect Beijing’s urgency to smother opposition to its encroaching authority over the territory after more than a year of political upheaval there. “More will come,” said Victoria Tin-bor Hui, a political scientist from Hong Kong at University of Notre Dame. The aggressive consolidation of power mirrors China’s broader moves to flex its political, economic and military might as the world is distracted by the pandemic. Western nations have pushed back aggressively against Beijing’s measures, imposing sanctions and even suspending extradition agreements with Hong Kong, but to no avail. In some ways, it appears to have emboldened China, which blames the dissent in Hong Kong on foreign interference. “The people of Hong Kong deserve to have their voice represented by the elected officials that they choose in those elections,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a radio interview on Thursday ahead of the postponement of the election. “If they destroy that, if they take that down, it will be another marker that will simply prove that the Chinese Communist Party has now made Hong Kong just another communist-run city.” Wang Wenbin, the chief spokesman of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Beijing was allowing the Hong Kong authorities to decide the timing of the election. But he also insisted that Beijing would not be dissuaded by any foreign countries from doing what it deems necessary in Hong Kong. “China is not afraid of intimidation by any external forces — our determination is unwavering and unshakable in safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests,” he said. On the mainland, China thoroughly stifles political dissent. For the authorities there, Hong Kong — with its nominal political autonomy and robust democracy movement — has been a major irritant, especially after huge protests openly and at times violently challenged Beijing’s control and even sovereignty over the city last year. With its crackdown, Beijing is following the authoritarian playbook of countries like Russia, holding elections but managing them so that they cease to reflect genuine voter will. Russia’s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, recently orchestrated a constitutional referendum to perpetuate his rule — and then followed it up with a series of arrests, hoping to smother discontent before it could gain momentum. “They are running short of confidence to face the people, to face the people’s choice, to face the people’s demands,” said Alvin Yeung, a sitting pro-democracy lawmaker from the moderate Civic Party who was disqualified from running on Thursday. “It’s fear.” Years in the making, the national security law created a climate of fear and uncertainty in only a matter of hours after it was imposed. The day the law took effect, the police detained 10 protesters for national security violations, including a young man on a motorcycle with a Hong Kong liberation flag who collided with police officers. Tong Ying-kit, who was hospitalized after the collision, was later the first charged under the new law. He remains in custody. The newly created agency to enforce the law, the Office for Safeguarding National Security, soon took up residence in the Metropark Hotel in Causeway Bay (a 4.5 rating on Tripadvisor.com) and surrounded it with barricades in a physical manifestation of Beijing’s growing authoritarian footprint on the city. The agency is headed by Zheng Yanxiong, a senior Communist Party official dispatched from Guangdong, the neighboring province on the mainland. He is best known for his hostility to a short-lived democracy experiment in a Guangdong village, Wukan, nearly a decade ago. On July 10, the Hong Kong police raided an independent polling institute whose computers were being used by democracy supporters for an unofficial primary to decide which candidates would run for the legislature. Five days later, the police arrested five activists, including a vice chairman of the territory’s Democratic Party, in connection with protests and violent clashes at Hong Kong Polytechnic University last November. The four young activists arrested on Wednesday were all former members of Studentlocalism, a pro-independence group led by secondary school students that ended its operations just before the security law took effect. In the past, the group had typically distributed leaflets supporting independence outside schools. Regina Ip, a cabinet member and the leader of a small pro-Beijing political party in the legislature, welcomed the arrest on Wednesday of the four activists, who ranged in age from 16 to 21. She said that their postings showed continued support for Hong Kong independence after the law went into effect, although the police have not elaborated on what the four specifically said. Their arrest shows that the authorities are “acting in accordance with the law,” she said. On Friday evening, Chinese state television reported that the Hong Kong police had issued warrants for the arrests of six democracy advocates who are now overseas. They are wanted on charges of promoting secession and colluding with foreign forces, according to the report — crimes that are punishable with life imprisonment under the security law. The police declined to comment.  One of the six, Samuel Chu, said on Twitter that he had been an American citizen for 25 years.  Also on Friday, Hong Kong’s secretary for justice said that David Leung, the city’s British-trained director of prosecutions, had submitted his resignation. Pro-Beijing politicians and the police had accused Mr. Leung of being too cautious about bringing charges against protesters, though he had prosecuted some high-profile activists. Mr. Leung did not issue a statement. The spirit of the security law has been used to justify the dismissal of the professor at the University of Hong Kong, Benny Tai. After the rollout of the rules, Mr. Tai, who was convicted of public nuisance for his role in protests in 2014, helped organize the recent primary vote for the pro-democracy camp. Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong supported his removal, describing it in a statement as “a just act of punishing evil and promoting good and conforming to the people’s will.” The security law was also invoked this week for the disqualifications of candidates for the legislature. The legislature cannot have seats “for these unscrupulous individuals who are plotting to destroy” Hong Kong, the liaison office said. The Hong Kong government said that candidates who objected “in principle” to Beijing’s enactment of the law were violating the oath to uphold Hong Kong’s constitution. The government also said it was unconstitutional to vow to block its legislative proposals in order to pressure the administration. Some opposition lawmakers had floated the idea of voting down the government’s budget. Under Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, that could force the resignation of the chief executive, Carrie Lam, and new elections. The yearlong delay in the election now gives the authorities time to disqualify more pro-democracy candidates from running and quash any remaining momentum of the anti-government movement. While the protests have largely quieted down since the law was imposed, the opposition had been looking toward the election as a way to revive their cause. The pro-democracy camp had been hoping for big gains in the voting, following their landslide victory last fall in district elections. With many of their most prominent leaders now banned from running, their chances seem less certain. Mr. Yeung, the lawmaker, said the government had failed to show that the election could not go ahead during the pandemic. He cited safety measures adopted by South Korea and Singapore during recent elections. “How on earth can they convince the rest of the world, including Hong Kong people and the international community, that they have no other ulterior motives other than public health concerns?” he said. Ms. Hui, from Notre Dame, compared Beijing’s strategy to Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War.” Beijing, she said, has exploited advantages to defeat its perceived enemies, not just with the security law in Hong Kong, but also in the South China Sea, on China’s border with India and in other contested areas. “The harshness of the law cannot be measured by the number of arrests,” she said, “but by the deterrent effects on silencing anyone who dares to dissent.” Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, Elaine Yu reported from Hong Kong and Steven Lee Myers reported from Seoul.']",
What Can Victorian Schools Teach America About Reopening?,2020-07-31,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. Every night, we wait for the email. Sometimes it comes in the late afternoon, but many nights it doesn’t hit my inbox until 10 or 11 p.m. Eventually, it arrives, written by a beleaguered school principal letting us know that my son’s high school is still closed. My family is in the same position as thousands of others in Victoria, where around 100 schools are dealing with similar situations. After months of remote learning, year 11 and 12 students in Melbourne returned to the classroom on July 14. For my son, who is in 11th grade, this in-person schooling lasted less than a week — on July 20 we were informed that a student at his school had tested positive for coronavirus and all in-person learning would be suspended while the school was cleaned and contact tracing conducted. As of today, July 31, the school is clean but the contact tracing continues. There has never been a timeline given to parents or students about how long that tracing will take. We wait day-to-day for updates on whether school will resume the next day. The principal waits on the Department of Health to let him know when contact tracing is complete, and the overburdened Department of Health does — I assume — its best, probably with some waiting of its own for coronavirus test results. With debate in the United States raging about whether schools should reopen after the annual summer break, there are some useful lessons in the struggles of our schools in Victoria. An opinion piece in the Times this week asked, “what happens when there is a Covid-19 case in a school?” Well, here in Melbourne, many schools are already answering that question. I spoke to Times education reporter Eliza Shapiro today just as she was finishing up a news brief about the plans drawn up by New York City’s school district — the largest in the U.S. — for reopening. It is one of the only large districts in the country to be attempting in-person learning any time soon, with most major districts opting for distance learning for the foreseeable future. Eliza’s reporting, along with Dana Goldstein, has shown that most large school districts are in danger of major community coronavirus spread if they reopen, but New York is eager to move ahead and the plans Eliza described to me are complex and ambitious, with specific standards for when schools will close down and under what conditions. “It’s really really complicated,” she told me. “We have so many vulnerable kids, so many kids with disabilities, so many homeless kids, so there’s a lot of interest in getting as many kids back in the classroom as possible. But once we actually open — if we open — real life is going to collide with these plans and it’s going to be really difficult.” What the Americans may not fully grasp is what we’ve already learned in Victoria: Plans can disappear quickly when the unpredictability of the virus comes into play. Each case or cluster becomes its own mystery, demanding time and resources while raising anxiety to new levels. To be clear: I place no blame on anyone for my son’s school situation. It’s an overused word in these bizarre times, but the situation is unprecedented and extremely complex. I applaud everyone involved for trying to keep the community as safe as possible. But Victorian schools are in a far better position than many American school systems by almost every metric, and yet things here are messy and unpredictable and often delayed for reasons that are unknown or not fully shared. Just like our nightly ritual of learning on-the-fly what our situation will be the following morning, the most disconcerting thing about this virus is the extreme uncertainty and endurance that it demands. What will tomorrow bring? Or the next day, month and year? I hope what we’re going through can, at the very least, help inform and prepare other parents, students and school districts what their own future may hold.

"Pilgrims, Fewer and Socially Distanced, Arrive in Mecca for Annual Hajj",2020-07-30,By Vivian Yee,"['BEIRUT, Lebanon — In any other year, Muslims undertaking the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca that all Muslims are supposed to perform at least once, would drink from a holy well. They would kiss the sacred black stone embedded in the Kaaba, the holiest shrine in Islam, as they thronged the Grand Mosque. Before they left Mecca, they would collect pebbles to ritually stone the devil, casting them at a series of symbolic pillars. During the coronavirus edition of the hajj that began Wednesday, however, the black stone is off limits to kissing and touching. The authorities in Saudi Arabia are issuing personal prayer rugs and bottled water from the holy Zamzam well instead of letting pilgrims drink from cups at the mosque. Even the pebbles pilgrims hurl at the devil have been sterilized, all in an effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak from marring a pilgrimage which tradition holds stretches back thousands of years. But the chief public health measure the Saudi government has taken to protect the hajj is to limit attendance, shrinking one of the world’s most famous crowds to a select, socially distanced few. Last year, some 2.5 million Muslims from around the world performed the hajj. This year, Saudi Arabia said it would allow just 1,000, all from within the kingdom, though some news reports suggested the final number could be higher. Adnan Hassan, 31, a Moroccan maintenance technician who lives in Saudi Arabia, was among those whose application to go to Mecca had been granted. “I felt like I was the luckiest person in the history of people,” he said. Despite his joy, Mr. Hassan said he hesitated over fears that he might get infected with the coronavirus.  But he and several other pilgrims said the government-mandated precautions had reassured them and that, so far, they felt safe. “My confidence in God is great,” Mr. Hassan said. “I am going to the house of God.” As the custodian of Mecca and Islam’s second-holiest city, nearby Medina, Saudi Arabia both enjoys the prestige of hosting millions of Muslim faithful each year and bears the responsibility of keeping them safe.  Crowds have led to tragedy in the past — hundreds, sometimes thousands of pilgrims have died in stampedes over the past century — but rarely have they posed such a danger as during the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the kingdom to restrict the hajj to its smallest size in modern history. Since Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 the hajj has never been canceled. But plagues, war and political disputes have led to restrictions in the past. Attendees this year are required to self-isolate before and after the pilgrimage and to maintain social distancing while performing it. Videos and photos from Mecca this week showed pilgrims placed in neatly spaced concentric circles around the black-clad Kaaba, which authorities said had been sterilized and perfumed by 3,500 workers. The pilgrims wore white garments and masks, carried personal prayer rugs and shaded themselves with colorful branded umbrellas, all provided by the hajj authorities in advance. Foreign residents of Saudi Arabia are expected to make up 70 percent of this year’s pilgrims, the kingdom announced this week, with the rest drawn from Saudi health care workers and security personnel who had recovered from Covid-19 — a gesture of appreciation for their service, officials said. The government did not say how the pilgrims were chosen, though it previously said it would give priority to healthy residents between 20 and 50 years old who had tested negative for the virus and had never performed the hajj before. The hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is required for all Muslims who are physically and financially able to go at least once in their lifetimes. Because of constraints on how many can participate, millions of Muslims around the world wait and save up for decades before they can perform the hajj, making this year’s effective cancellation especially devastating for those who were scheduled to attend. The restrictions have also caused economic injury, wiping out the huge sums hajj pilgrims spend each year on travel agency packages, hotels and meals in Mecca and Medina and visa fees charged by Saudi Arabia.']","The coronavirus pandemic has curtailed the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, limiting the number of people and barring people from outside the kingdom."
"In India, a Gay Prince’s Coming Out Earns Accolades, and Enemies",2020-07-31,By Shalini Venugopal Bhagat,"['NEW DELHI — Born into a royal family that once ruled the kingdom of Rajpipla in India, he was raised in the family’s palaces and mansions and was being groomed to take over a dynasty that goes back 600 years. But then he gave an interview that prompted his mother to disown him and set off protests in his hometown, where he was burned in effigy. Since coming out as gay in that 2006 interview, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil has faced a torrent of bullying and threats, and was disinherited by his family for a period. But he has also earned global accolades for his L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy, becoming one of the few gay-rights activists in the world with such royal ties. As part of his efforts, Prince Manvendra, 55, has appeared on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” three times, swapped life stories with Kris Jenner on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and is working to establish a shelter for L.G.B.T.Q. people on his property in the Indian state of Gujarat. He is also working with several aid agencies to prevent the spread of H.I.V. among gay men. Prince Manvendra and his husband, deAndre Richardson, have spent the last few months in lockdown getting the shelter ready. They envision a safe space where those who have been disowned by their families can get back on their feet and learn job skills. “I know how important it is to have a safe space after coming out,” the prince said. Although India abolished the princely order in 1971, the honorary titles are still commonly used for royal descendants, and traditional responsibilities are still carried out. When the prince shared that he was gay in that front-page newspaper interview 14 years ago, it created a storm of mostly negative publicity. It was shocking for a member of an Indian royal family, especially one from the rigidly conservative Rajput warrior clan that once ruled over large parts of northern and central India, to come out so publicly. Being gay was a criminal offense in India under the archaic British law in effect at the time. The law was struck down in 2018. The fallout from his announcement was brutal, beginning with protests in his hometown, Rajpipla, where he was burned in effigy. His mother took out a newspaper advertisement to announce she was disowning him. The government offered him security after he received several death threats, but he turned down the offer and refused to back down. “I decided that I would continue fighting because I have truth on my side,” he said. Prince Manvendra was born in 1965 to Raghubir Singh Gohil, the current honorary maharajah of Rajpipla, and Rukmani Devi Gohil, the daughter of the former maharajah of Jaisalmer. By that time, the era of fabulously rich Indian maharajahs had already waned. His great-grandfather’s ostentatious display of wealth, with stables of racehorses and garages filled with Rolls-Royces (nearly a dozen), was no longer welcome in a newly independent India where socialism, austerity and self-sufficiency were the new mantras. Although Prince Manvendra’s family no longer ruled a kingdom, the old ways still largely prevailed. He spent most of his childhood in his family’s seven-bedroom mansion in Mumbai, staffed by servants who had worked for the family for generations. He barely saw his parents and was raised primarily by the same nanny who had raised his mother. “Until I was 9 or 10, I thought my nanny was my mother,” he said. “I didn’t realize that the glamorous woman who appeared once in a while was actually my mother.” The lack of parental love still wounds him. “Why do parents give birth to children if they don’t want to take care of them?” he said. His childhood was excruciatingly lonely. His only friends were the birds and other animals he rescued as a young child. “I grew up with literally no friends, because I knew I couldn’t invite anyone home,” he said, because he was allowed to socialize only with children from a similar background. He earned a college degree in commerce and accounting and went on to complete law school, although he has never practiced law. In 1991, he married Chandrika Kumari, a princess from the royal family of Jhabua, a match entered into voluntarily, he emphasized. “I was attracted to men but I thought it was just a passing phase,” he said. “I had never been allowed to spend time alone with a girl, and sex before marriage was out of the question.” Being gay was not a possibility that ever crossed his mind, he said, because he knew nothing about it. “Once we got married, it became clear to me that I wasn’t interested in women sexually,” he said. “We were very good friends, we got along very well, but there was no sexual attraction.” The couple called it quits 15 months later, a split that caused an uproar in royal circles. After the divorce, he said, he was wracked with guilt and confused about his sexuality. He moved back to Mumbai, a 26-year-old divorced virgin, and started exploring his sexuality for the first time. “I started reading books and magazines. I saw an article about Ashok Row Kavi and his gay magazine Bombay Dost. I decided to get in touch with him and ask him if I could possibly be gay,” he recalled. Mr. Kavi is a father of India’s gay-rights movement. In 1977, he came out publicly and went on to found Bombay Dost, India’s first gay magazine, in 1990. He founded the Humsafar Trust, the first group to provide health services and advocacy for gay men, in 1994. Mr. Kavi introduced Prince Manvendra to other people in the community and trained him as a counselor. He remembers the young prince as a painfully shy introvert, who was slowly starting to become comfortable with his identity. He said the prince quietly funded the first telephone help line for gay people in India. In 2000, with Mr. Kavi’s encouragement, the prince started the Lakshya Trust in Gujarat to help the gay community there. The work was fulfilling, but as a closeted gay man, the prince said, it became increasingly difficult to do the advocacy work needed for Lakshya. And there was growing pressure to remarry. After he suffered a nervous breakdown in 2002, his psychiatrist convinced him the first step in his recovery was to come out to his parents. It was the beginning of a long and bitter ordeal. “My parents were in an absolute state of denial,” Prince Manvendra said. “They declared that science must have a cure for my condition, a surgery perhaps or shock therapy to cure my ‘disease.’” But every doctor his parents consulted told them the same thing — homosexuality was not a disease or a mental disorder. His parents finally gave up on medical science and decided to try religion instead. For three years, they took him to dozens of religious leaders around the country. “Ashok told me to cooperate with them completely,” the prince said. “To let them be satisfied that they’d tried their best.” There were financial consequences to his coming out. He says that he was removed from several family businesses and that his mother threatened to persuade the government to cancel funding for the Lakshya Trust. “I finally reached a point in my life where I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. “I decided to tell the whole world.” Over the past 14 years, the once-shy royal has grown accustomed to the spotlight and become a vocal activist for the gay rights movement. Apart from his work with the Lakshya Trust, he is a founding member of the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health and is an ambassador consultant of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. “He was living a very troubled life, under a lot of pressure,” said Chirantana Bhatt, a close friend. “But now it’s a life of pride, in the true sense.” He has also found love. In 2013, he married Mr. Richardson, an American he met online in 2009, in the United States. The couple live on an estate in Gujarat given to the prince by his father. His modest brick house there is a far cry from the opulent palace of his ancestors, but he says he could not be happier. His father, the maharajah, acknowledged in an interview that it was difficult for the family to come to terms with his son’s sexuality and the constant media attention on the family. “But it’s his decision,” the maharajah said. His relationship with his mother remains frosty, but other members of the family have been supportive, he says. His grandmother, on her deathbed, expressed her happiness that he had found a partner to share his life with. Prince Manvendra is cautiously optimistic about the future. He is not sure if he will become the next honorary maharajah of Rajpipla. “I have left it to my family members,” he said. “I would prefer to keep working for my cause because the role of maharajah comes with a lot of responsibilities and duties that would divert me from my activism.”']",Prince Manvendra’s journey from an excruciatingly lonely child to a global L.G.B.T.Q. advocate included death threats and disinheritance.
Mysterious Coronavirus Outbreak Catches Vietnam by Surprise,2020-07-29,By Hannah Beech and Chau Doan,"['In a world plagued by pandemic, Vietnam seemed like a miracle. As months went by without a single recorded coronavirus death, or even a confirmed case of local transmission, residents began leaving their face masks at home. Noodle shops resounded with the clack of chopsticks and sipped broth. Schools opened. And lured by good deals, Vietnamese tourists began taking vacations again, crowding the coastal city of Danang, with its golden beaches and plentiful seafood. But over the weekend, Vietnam, which had gone about 100 days without a single confirmed case of local transmission, announced that the virus was lurking in the country after all — and it was spreading. First, a 57-year-old man from Danang tested positive for the virus and is now on life support. Then clusters quickly emerged in five hospitals. By Wednesday, the virus had spread north to Hanoi, the capital, south to Ho Chi Minh City and afflicted two provinces in central Vietnam, as well as the remote Central Highlands. The surge of the coronavirus in Vietnam, which has so far recorded fewer than 450 cases, revealed the dangers of the virus even in places that appeared to have done most everything right in their battle against contagion. Japan, China, Australia and South Korea, all of which seemed to have their outbreaks reasonably under control, recorded spikes on Wednesday. In the Australian state of Victoria, authorities announced 295 new cases on Wednesday, along with nine new deaths. Hong Kong, which kept its caseload low for months, is now racing against a wave of new infections, sickening about 100 people a day. With infections turning up in nursing homes and restaurants, Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive, warned on Tuesday that Hong Kong was “on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak.” Although Vietnam, a nation of 95 million people, remains the largest country in the world to have not confirmed a single fatality from the coronavirus, the mystery surrounding the infections popping up across the country has spooked medical experts and residents alike. “In my opinion, this outbreak is more dangerous than the previous one because it is happening at the same time in many places,” said Nguyen Huy Nga, the dean of public health and nursing at Quang Trung University in Binh Dinh Province. “We do not know the source of disease, especially with tens of thousands of tourists flocking to Danang.” The Vietnamese authorities have reacted to the latest wave of cases with the kind of fast and forceful response that characterized their actions in the early days of the pandemic. Hours after clusters of cases were confirmed in Danang hospitals earlier this week, officials said they would be shutting the city’s airport. Up to 80,000 local tourists who had flooded the city for a summer break would be evacuated, the authorities said. Since then, several provinces have instituted quarantines for arrivals from Danang, and the dragnet has already turned up positive cases. A waiter at a pizzeria in Hanoi tested positive for the coronavirus after visiting Danang with his family, local news media reported. On Wednesday, the pizzeria was sprayed down with disinfectant by workers in protective gear, according to a video released by local news media. In the Central Highlands, a 21-year-old woman who had been studying in Danang and returned home by car also tested positive. In Danang, a normally bustling city popular with tourists and traders alike, restaurants and bars are closed. Face masks are mandatory again. With holiday swimming in the sea banned by local authorities, the city’s famous beaches were deserted on Wednesday, residents said. “My family and I are not in the area where people are infected but I am very worried,” said Le Thi Thuy Vi, a grocer in Danang. “I decided today that the whole family should stay at home.” As the coronavirus began radiating out from the Chinese city of Wuhan in January, Vietnam, which shares a border and a governing ideology with China but remains wary of its northern neighbor, moved swiftly. The country had learned from previous outbreaks of novel contagions, such as SARS and H1N1 influenza. By late January, Vietnam had shut its schools. A bureaucracy well equipped to track the local populace turned its attention to comprehensive contact tracing. Most Vietnamese, already conditioned to wearing face masks because of air pollution, saw the value in protecting themselves from airborne viral droplets. After a woman returned from the fashion shows in Europe and helped to spread the coronavirus at home, Vietnam stopped nearly all international flights in March, and returning nationals have to undergo quarantine in government facilities. On Wednesday, 120 Vietnamese hydropower workers arrived on a government charter from Equatorial Guinea, where they had contracted the coronavirus. It is the largest contingent of infected returnees to take a government-sponsored repatriation flight, the Vietnamese foreign ministry said. Last week, Vietnam effectively banned the wildlife trade, amid fears that the trafficking of exotic fauna might have precipitated the emergence of the latest outbreak. Vietnam is both a consumer of illegal wildlife products and a transit point of endangered animals destined for China across its shared mountainous border. With no clarity as to the source of the outbreak in Danang, which has infected at least 26 people there, medical authorities were racing to figure out how cases were proliferating in a supposedly closed country. The health ministry said that the strain of virus detected in Danang is different from ones that circulated during the earlier round of local transmission. “This is imported,” said Professor Nga, the public health expert at Quang Trung University. “A virus cannot survive for three months in a community without causing illness.” Professor Nga said he thought the virus likely arrived in Vietnam in late June or early July. In Danang, the police fanned out across the city, trying to locate outsiders who might have brought the virus with them. On Saturday, the police apprehended nine Chinese nationals who had sneaked into Vietnam illegally, local authorities said. Dozens more Chinese who had entered the country illegally were nabbed earlier this month in central Vietnam. A Chinese man, whom the police said had set up an illegal immigration network, was arrested on Monday. The Chinese who were caught were either put in quarantine camps or isolated in hospitals, the police said. Across Vietnam, hospitals were getting beds ready to handle a rise in cases. Professor Nga noted that ventilators and other equipment needed in the fight against the coronavirus are limited in Vietnam. People, he said, had become complacent. “After 100 days with no outbreaks, people weren’t taking precautions anymore,” Professor Nga said. “They weren’t wearing masks or cleaning their hand with soap. People were going to crowded places.” In Danang, Nguyen Thi Minh Hoa, a director of a marketing firm, said that grocery shelves were not being emptied en masse, meaning that residents were anxious but not panicked. Renewed social distancing measures were being followed carefully, she said. “I’m just sad that this coastal city has suddenly become a center of disease after 100 days of peace,” Ms. Hoa said. Hannah Beech reported from Bangkok and Chau Doan from Hanoi, Vietnam.']","After months without a single coronavirus death, or even a confirmed case of local transmission, a new outbreak has struck Vietnam.

Former Marine Sentenced to 9 Years in Russia in Case Criticized as Political,2020-07-30,By Ivan Nechepurenko,"['MOSCOW — When Trevor R. Reed, a former U.S. Marine, traveled to Moscow from his home in Texas in May 2019, he planned to spend the summer with his Russian girlfriend and take some language lessons. By August, he was in jail, facing charges of assaulting and endangering the lives of two police officers, accusations that his family and supporters say are fraudulent and politically motivated. On Thursday, a court in Moscow sentenced Mr. Reed to nine years in prison for the August 2019 episode. He has already spent more than 11 months in a Russian jail. After his sentencing, Mr. Reed spoke to the courtroom from the locked metal cage where defendants sit throughout a trial, criticizing what he sees as the political nature of the case and urging the American government to intervene on his behalf. “I think anyone who has eyes and ears and who has been in this courtroom knows that I’m not guilty,” Mr. Reed said. He added that it was his military affiliation that seemed to have incited the interest of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or the F.S.B., which questioned him extensively after his arrest.  “They didn’t ask me anything about fighting police, they asked me where I served in the Marine Corps, what deployments I was on,” he said. “Everything about this case is political.” But prosecutors maintained that Mr. Reed went on a rampage that endangered the lives of two police officers, when he attacked them after a day of heavy drinking. Mr. Reed and his family have adamantly denied the allegations that he attacked the officers, and say the case against him was unsupported by forensic evidence. Supporters of his cause have likened it to Russia’s recent prosecution of another former Marine, Paul Whelan. In June, Mr. Whelan was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges during a trial that was closed to the public. A number of observers see the cases as a Russian effort to create leverage for a potential prisoner exchange with the American government. “It all looks like a provocation designed to obtain a certain resource that can be used later in international negotiations,” said Ivan Pavlov, a prominent Russian lawyer, when presented with the details of Mr. Reed’s case. “This can be a bargaining chip.” Prosecutors in Mr. Reed’s case presented little forensic evidence, and the testimony of police officers was inconsistent. Mr. Reed’s lawyers said that investigators also waited long enough that CCTV footage from inside the police car had expired and been deleted from the hard drive. “This case, when I read it, I realized that it was just complete nonsense,” said Sergei V. Nikitenkov, one of Mr. Reed’s lawyers. Mr. Reed had met his Russian girlfriend, Alina V. Tsybulnik, 22, on a dating website in 2016. At the time, he was working for a private defense contractor in Afghanistan, and the two later met in person during a vacation in Greece. Ms. Tsybulnik also visited Mr. Reed in Texas several times over the past four years. In May 2019, Mr. Reed traveled to Russia to spend time with Ms. Tsybulnik, who is a lawyer, and learn Russian. One week before he was to leave, Ms. Tsybulnik’s friends held a party in a park outside Moscow. At the party, Mr. Reed drank more than 23 ounces of vodka, according to his lawyers. After the party, Ms. Tsybulnik’s friends offered to drive the couple home, but during the trip, Mr. Reed became increasingly agitated. He asked the driver to stop the car and began running drunkenly near a busy highway, while waving his hands and shouting incoherently, the court heard. Worried for his safety, his girlfriend and others called the police, according to Ms. Tsybulnik. Mr. Reed said in court that he has no memory of what happened that night after he drank five or six shots of vodka. Mr. Reed’s family speculated in a statement that he “may have been given other substances without his knowledge.” The police officers took Mr. Reed to the police station in their car, and Ms. Tsybulnik said she and her friends followed them throughout the journey. At the police station, Ms. Tsybulnik was advised to return the following morning to pick up Mr. Reed after he sobered up. When she returned, she found Mr. Reed had been beaten up, she said, and one of the police officers demanded $1,000 to let him go. The officer denied the bribery allegation. An hour later, several officers from the F.S.B. arrived and without an interpreter or lawyer present, interviewed Mr. Reed, who had various forms of identification in his wallet confirming his status as a former member of the military. “The fact that F.S.B. officers appeared means that they were interested in the detained person,” Mr. Pavlov, the lawyer, said. “They could have even followed him before.” Mr. Reed was charged with endangering the lives of the police officers. The officers testified that during their trip to the station, Mr. Reed grabbed the driver’s arm, causing the car to swerve into the opposite lane. Mr. Reed, they said, elbowed one in the stomach. CCTV footage presented in court did not appear to show the car swerve. In September 2019, Mr. Reed’s father Joey, 60, a retired fire chief, flew to Moscow to help his son with the legal proceedings. “We want our son home, I don’t care how,” Mr. Reed said in an interview. For two months, Trevor Reed wasn’t allowed an interpreter, and was habitually denied medical treatment for his health conditions, his family said. For seven months, investigators didn’t allow family members to see him, they said. John J. Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, issued a statement on Thursday calling the sentencing the “theater of the absurd.” Vladimir A. Zherebenkov, a lawyer for Mr. Whelan, the other former Marine on trial this summer, said the arrests of Americans in Russia is a form of retaliation after the arrest of Russian citizens in the United States. “It is natural that a Russian reaction to this followed,” Mr. Zherebenkov said in an interview. Russian authorities have been vocal in condemning the American detention of Russian citizens. Mr. Zherebenkov said that Mr. Whelan had decided not to appeal his long sentence to help his potential for a prisoner exchange. He is still being held in Moscow’s high-security Lefortovo prison. High-level negotiations continue over Mr. Whelan’s fate, Mr. Zherebenkov said, adding that the Russian government would like to exchange him for Viktor Bout, a convicted arms dealer, and Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted drug smuggler. Aleksei Tarasov, a Texas lawyer who represents Mr. Bout and Mr. Yaroshenko in American courts, said in an interview that he is aware of negotiations between Russian and American representatives, but the final decision has to be made by the two countries’ political leaders. “People who are interested in the exchange are aware of that case, too,” Mr. Tarasov said of Mr. Reed’s prosecution. “I know that they are interested in it.”']",Trevor R. Reed was charged with assaulting and endangering the lives of two police officers in a case that some have likened to that of another former U.S. Marine in Russia.
Hong Kong Is Keeping Pro-Democracy Candidates Out of Its Election,2020-07-30,"By Austin Ramzy, Elaine Yu and Tiffany May","['HONG KONG — Weeks after the Chinese government imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong, raising fears of a broader crackdown on the semiautonomous territory, the city’s authorities have taken aggressive steps against the pro-democracy opposition. Officials on Thursday barred 12 candidates, including well-known pro-democracy figures, from the September legislative election. The disqualifications came a day after the police made what appeared to be the first targeted arrests of four activists accused of posting pro-independence messages online. Local news outlets also reported that the government was considering postponing the election by as much as a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, though pro-democracy lawmakers argued it would be a naked attempt to avoid a loss at the polls. Opposition candidates said they had hoped to ride a wave of protests and public discontent to electoral success on Sept. 6. But they had also acknowledged the fear that the government would disqualify candidates on the nebulous grounds that they would not uphold the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Constitution. The candidates who said they were barred included Joshua Wong, a prominent activist, and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist, both of them front-runners in an unofficial democratic primary this month. The list also includes four sitting lawmakers, including members of the moderate, pro-democracy Civic Party. Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong said it supported the disqualifications. The Hong Kong government said more could follow. It also said in a statement that grounds for disqualification included advocating Hong Kong’s independence or self-determination, soliciting intervention from foreign governments, expressing an objection in principle to the national security law Beijing imposed last month, or vowing to indiscriminately vote against government proposals. “The excuse they use is that I describe national security law as a draconian law, which shows that I do not support this sweeping law,” Mr. Wong, 23, wrote on Facebook. “Clearly, Beijing shows a total disregard for the will of the Hongkongers, tramples upon the city’s last pillar of vanishing autonomy and attempts to keep Hong Kong’s legislature under its firm grip.” Disqualification letters sent to the pro-democracy lawmakers Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok and Kenneth Leung said their calls for the U.S. to impose sanctions on those responsible for rights abuses in Hong Kong would violate the national security law. Mr. Yeung and Mr. Kwok said in their reply that their visit to New York last August and a joint letter they sent in September to U.S. senators took place months before the national security law took effect. Though the security law could not be applied retroactively, election officers said candidates’ past actions and remarks reflected their true intentions. Mr. Yeung’s disqualification letter also accused him of planning, along with other members of the Civic Party, to “indiscriminately vote down” government proposals. Under the Basic Law, the chief executive must call for a new legislative election if the government cannot pass a budget. If it happens again under a new legislature, the chief executive must step down. Eric Cheung, a law lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said he believed lawmakers had the constitutional right to block government proposals and compel the leader to step down. He said the mass disqualifications showed that Hong Kong was growing increasingly similar to mainland China. “According to the legal system in the mainland, one cannot openly oppose the regime, which is considered to be beyond the limits of free speech,” he said. “Only allowing certain people they find acceptable to run isn’t a free election — it’s what totalitarian governments do.” The disqualifications came on the heels of the arrests of four people accused of publishing social media posts that called for the city to become independent from China. The sweep on Wednesday was an early indication that the authorities would strictly enforce the new law and crack down on speech that was now considered illegal. The police said the activists, three men and one woman whose ages range from 16 to 21, were arrested in the New Territories area of Hong Kong for the “publishing of content about secession, and inciting or abetting others for the commission of secession.” Officers seized mobile phones, computers and documents during the roundup. Li Kwai-wah, a senior superintendent of the Hong Kong police’s new national security department, said the arrests had been made after an organization posted on social media about creating a new party to promote Hong Kong independence. Its “declarations” referred to establishing a “Hong Kong country” and using “all means” to achieve its goals, Mr. Li said. Mr. Li gave no further information about the organization or about the four people arrested. He said the comments had been posted after the security law took effect, but he would not say whether they had been taken down or elaborate further on their content. A political organization called Studentlocalism said its former convener, Tony Chung, was among those arrested. When the national security law took effect, the group said it had ended its operations in Hong Kong but that some members would continue to work overseas. The legislation came into force a month ago and gives the Chinese government broad new powers over the semiautonomous territory. The new law targets subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers, and many of its clauses indicate they were written to curb the protests. For a city that had generally had strong protections for free speech, the legislation represented a drastic shift. The law had already been cited in the arrests of about a dozen people during several demonstrations, including on July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control. Human rights groups denounced those street arrests, saying they showed that the authorities intended to use the new powers to clamp down on peaceful activities. The Wednesday arrests, rights groups said, sent another chilling message and raised concerns about a crackdown on activism and political speech in Hong Kong. “The gross misuse of this draconian law makes clear that the aim is to silence dissent, not protect national security,” said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch. Under the new law, Chinese security agencies can now operate openly in Hong Kong. But the Hong Kong police said the arrests had been carried out by its own national security department. Beijing imposed the security law after more than a year of large protests in Hong Kong, many of which involved violent clashes with the police. The protests were set off by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China from Hong Kong, which is guaranteed its own legal system under the terms of the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997. The demonstrations evolved to encompass a range of issues, including the police’s use of force and calls for expanding direct elections. This month, more than 600,000 people participated in a primary for the pro-democracy camp despite warnings from the government that it was possibly illegal. That show of support followed a landslide win for opposition candidates in district council elections in November.']","Twelve candidates, including several prominent democracy advocates, were barred from an upcoming legislative election, and four activists were arrested over online posts."
Canada’s Key Role in Creating a Once Awaited Vaccine,2020-08-01,By Ian Austen,"['Canadians don’t have to go back to 1918 and the start of the Spanish flu pandemic to find an analogy to today. For decades, waves of polio outbreaks gripped the country with fear, death and uncertainty, as recently as the 1950s. At times, the outbreaks caused Canada to limit travel from the United States. Special hospitals were set up in some provinces to help children paralyzed by polio when physiotherapy was established. The iron lung began appearing in hospitals to assist patients’ breathing. School openings were delayed in many communities in a bid to reduce polio’s spread. Ultimately, about 50,000 Canadian children were infected with polio during four major epidemics, and 4,000 of them died. During the 1940s and ’50s, an era before publicly funded health care, the federal government and many provinces began pouring money and resources into efforts to eliminate polio through a vaccine. Dr. Jonas Salk, an American, became a global celebrity for developing that vaccine. But much less well known is the critical role the Connaught Laboratories in Toronto and Dr. Leone N. Farrell, one of its researchers, played in making testing and then mass production of that vaccine a reality. “We’re kind of at a similar stage with the Covid vaccines as the one where she came involved with polio,” Christopher Rutty, a medical historian who is an adjunct professor at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, told me this week. “A vaccine may work at a small scale, but upscaling is a major, different challenge.” Dr. Salk’s breakthrough was taking the live polio vaccine and killing it with formaldehyde. When injected into people, the killed virus still produced an antibody reaction that provided immunity. The polio virus was grown in cultures of monkey kidney cells. But Dr. Salk was initially only able to create a few grams of virus at a time in test tubes. At the time, the substance of choice for growing viruses or bacteria, Dr. Rutty said, was meat, a method that could lead to allergic reactions in patients who received the vaccines. Connaught, however, had come up with a synthetic, liquid growth mixture, known as Medium 199, for cancer cell research that produced more virus, more quickly and without contamination. It was provided to Dr. Salk for his polio efforts. It was Dr. Farrell, one of a very small number of women then working as research chemists in Canada, who figured out how to safely produce vast quantities of virus in Medium 199. Adapting earlier work, she developed what came to be known as the Toronto Method. Racks of specially designed machines gently rocked bottles of Method 199 and the virus. Her next task was to get enough machines built and to hire enough qualified staff to make not only enough virus for the tests in the United States, Canada and Finland, but also to create enough vaccine to inoculate all of Canada’s children. In a bid to accelerate vaccination, the Canadian government gambled and placed an order with Connaught before knowing if the Salk vaccine would prove safe and effective in tests. It did, with the result made public on April 12, 1955, the day before Dr. Farrell’s birthday. “I could not help feeling that I had received a pretty fine present,” she said in a speech that fall. Variations of the Toronto Method were used until the 1970s to make polio vaccines, Dr. Rutty told me. Apparently, at Dr. Farrell’s request, Connaught decided not to patent the process. Dr. Rutty, who is the expert when it comes to Canada’s role in polio research and who serves as the historian for Connaught’s successor company, Sanofi Pasteur Canada, said that frustratingly little is known about Dr. Farrell’s personal life. She never married, as was the case with many other women in Canadian medical research, nor had children. In 1941, when Dr. Farrell was inquiring about a post in naval intelligence,  she seemed to try to head off any potential sexism byportraying herself as someone who could become one of the guys. “My intention has always been ‘to be a lady chemist — and not look like it,’” she wrote in the letter. She added: “So conscious am I of my environment and keenly aware of people in all their phases as persons that I have been charged with being a chameleon.” Before retiring in 1969, Dr. Farrell took on several other major projects including one that greatly increased penicillin production. But she received relatively little public recognition in her lifetime and was buried in an unmarked grave after her death in 1986. In 2009, Dr. Farrell’s name and a tribute to her work were added to a family tombstone. Dr. Rutty said that he hopes to do more research about her life. “Farrell is a unique person,” he said. “Without her, there really wouldn’t have been a vaccine, at least not then.” There was no corruption, just a government working to save lives during a pandemic. That’s the message Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered on Thursday to skeptical Parliamentarians, and to Canadians, about the government’s decision to award a hefty no-bid contract to a charity with ties with his family, Catherine Porter reports.

She doesn’t know whether he’s dead or has simply left town after a heated argument between them.

U.K. Officials’ New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?,2020-07-31,By Mark Landler,"['LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II threw him an extravagant state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Former Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed him to Blenheim Palace, the family seat of his hero, Winston Churchill. Her successor, Boris Johnson, refused to join a global chorus of criticism after he ordered troops to break up a Black Lives Matter protest outside the White House. Few countries have worked harder than Britain to please President Trump. But now, with Mr. Trump trailing in the polls to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., British officials are waking up to an unsettling prospect: The president they tried so hard to accommodate may be out of power next year. In Paris and Berlin, a Trump defeat would be welcomed as an unalloyed relief, removing a leader who has sundered alliances, threatened a trade war, and tried to dismantle the European project. But in London, where Mr. Johnson’s government just left the European Union, it is more complicated. At a moment of British isolation, Mr. Trump’s full-throated endorsement of Brexit has made the United States a safe harbor. His promise of a lucrative trade deal gave Mr. Johnson a selling point with his voters. His populist politics were in sync with the bare-knuckle tactics of the Brexiteers. If Mr. Biden wins in November, Britain would face a president who opposed Brexit, would look out for the interests of Ireland in a post-Brexit Europe, and would have little motive to prioritize an Anglo-American trade deal. His former boss, President Barack Obama, once warned Britons that if they left the European Union, they would put themselves at the “back of the queue” in any trade talks with the United States. “It will not be lost on Biden that the last two British prime ministers went out of their way to be nice to and about Trump,” said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States. “He is instinctively comfortable with Brits, but London will have to work on the relationship.” As Mr. Trump’s polling numbers have eroded, pro-government papers have begun to make the case that a President Biden would actually be better for Britain than President Trump. Unlike Mr. Trump, he is a believer in alliances. He would not subject Mr. Johnson to rude lectures about the need for Britain to take a harder line against China. He would not be toxic with much of the British public. In a recent column in The Sunday Times, a well-connected political journalist, Tim Shipman, quoted an unnamed government minister saying that a Trump defeat ‘‘would make things much easier.’’ That sounds like a government hedging its bets. Mr. Johnson has been careful to say nothing about the American election but he has already tried to keep Mr. Trump at arm’s length even as he avoids offending him. Mr. Trump, by contrast, called into a London radio show in the heat of the British election to praise Mr. Johnson and run down his opponent. Britain’s uneasiness is compounded by the strangeness of this election. The Biden campaign has all but banned contact with foreign governments to avoid the questions that dogged the Trump campaign in 2016 about its ties to Russia. The pandemic has deprived Britain of its long practice of embedding a diplomat in the challenger’s campaign because there is little in-person campaigning. Jonathan Powell, who as a young British diplomat rode on the bus during Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, said the connections he made were valuable in smoothing over bitterness Mr. Clinton’s aides felt toward Britain’s Conservative government after it tried to dig up incriminating details about Mr. Clinton’s years at Oxford to help George H.W. Bush’s campaign. Mr. Powell later introduced Mr. Clinton to Tony Blair, who went on to become prime minister and a friendlier counterpart. Riding the bus is less important this time, he said, given that Mr. Biden is already so well-known to British officials. But the lack of a personal connection may foretell a relationship that is destined to become more distant. The risk for Britain, several experts said, is not a sudden rupture but a gradual slide into irrelevance. Mr. Biden’s emphasis, they said, would be on mending fences with Berlin and Paris, not celebrating a “special relationship” with London that got plenty of attention from his predecessor. On a visit to London in October 2018, Mr. Biden, not yet a candidate, cast his opposition to Brexit in geopolitical terms, saying it would make Britain less valuable to the United States as a lever to influence the European Union. “Had I been a member of Parliament, had I been a British citizen, I would have voted against leaving,” Mr. Biden said at Chatham House, the London research institution. “U.S. interests,” he added, “are diminished with Great Britain not an integral part of Europe.” Charles A. Kupchan, a professor at Georgetown University who worked on European affairs in the Obama White House and is advising Mr. Biden’s campaign, said, “The question is not, ‘Will there be a special relationship?’ There will be. The question is, ‘Will the special relationship matter?’” British officials recognize the challenge. They cite human rights and Russia as areas where Britain could carve out a robust role alongside the United States. Mr. Johnson’s recent reversal barring the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from access to its 5G network brings Britain in line with a more hawkish American policy toward China. That is likely to extend beyond Mr. Trump’s presidency. He may need to patch up other lingering issues. In 2016, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, he recounted in a newspaper column that Mr. Obama replaced a bust of Churchill in the Oval Office with one of Martin Luther King Jr., and attributed the switch to “the part-Kenyan president’s ancestral dislike of the British Empire.” Some say fears of tension between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Biden are overblown. “It’s part of the job for American presidents to get along with prime ministers,” said Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member of Parliament who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and has spoken with advisers to Mr. Biden. Still, there are potential land mines, not least Northern Ireland. A devoted Irish-American, Mr. Biden will fiercely defend Ireland’s interests, as will his allies in the Democratic Party’s Irish lobby on Capitol Hill. In speeches, Mr. Biden’s go-to literary reference is from ‘‘Easter 1916,’’ a poem by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats about the Irish uprising against British rule. British diplomats gamely point out that Mr. Biden has English roots, too. He has talked of a great-great-great grandfather who was a captain in the British East India Trading Company. But they say that as far as Brexit goes, his primary concern is likely to be the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement, the Clinton-era accord that ended decades of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland. “Biden is very keen on his Irish Catholic roots, though he has British ones too,” Mr. Westmacott said. “If the U.K. ends up with a no deal or other Brexit outcome which is bad news for Ireland, he will not be impressed.” So far, Mr. Johnson has avoided that problem by striking a withdrawal agreement with the European Union that leaves an open border on the island of Ireland. But Ireland could still suffer economic damage if Britain fails to negotiate permanent trading arrangements with Brussels. Trade is another area where Mr. Biden could prove frustrating. Mr. Trump’s promise of a blockbuster deal with Britain had already begun to fade, with his trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, saying last month it was unlikely before the election. Were Mr. Biden to win, experts said, he would face a Democratic Party deeply skeptical of a deal, at a time when free trade is in retreat worldwide. British officials recently floated the idea of both countries joining the successor agreement to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump pulled out of in 2017, as a way to sidestep the thorny issues in a direct negotiation. But even if Mr. Biden were to rejoin T.P.P. — a big if — analysts noted that its provisions on food sanitation were largely written by the United States and would raise the same objections that have stymied trans-Atlantic talks. “In other words,” said Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Center for European Reform, “the chlorine chicken debate is here to stay.”']","If Joe Biden wins the November election, Britain would face a president who opposed Brexit, would look out for Ireland, and may have little interest in a trade deal."
Hong Kong Bans Eating in Restaurants. And Then It Doesn’t.,2020-07-31,By Elaine Yu,"['HONG KONG — Hong Kongers have rarely seen their government react so swiftly to public opinion. On Thursday, city officials lifted a ban on dining in restaurants — imposed just a day earlier, to fight the spread of the coronavirus — after a public outcry sparked by pictures of workers and older people eating outside in the punishing July heat, on pavements, curbs and the steps of footbridges. Hong Kong is battling its worst community outbreak since the pandemic began, after initial success in containing the coronavirus. This month, the death toll nearly doubled in a week — as of Friday, it stood at 27 — and infections sharply spiked. Some new clusters were linked to nursing homes and restaurants, while scores of other cases had no known origin. The government’s initial response included limits on restaurants’ opening hours, with dining in allowed until 6 p.m. but forbidden after that. But with case numbers staying high, dine-in service was banned altogether on Wednesday — leaving many working-class residents, used to grabbing a quick bite during the lunch hour at one of Hong Kong’s countless inexpensive restaurants, with nowhere to go. Photos of the results quickly went viral, including one of a 62-year-old cleaner eating in a park during a downpour, huddled under an umbrella. (“What can I do; I can only blame myself for being poor,” a local news outlet, Citizen News, quoted the man as saying.) Chan Chun-heung, 50, who sells vegetables at a wet market in the Wan Chai District, said she had to eat her Wednesday lunch sitting on the ground. “I had to cover my food whenever someone walked past me, otherwise the dust would get everywhere,” Ms. Chan said. “And it was so hot.” Critics accused the government of failing to think about working people who can’t spend their lunch breaks in air-conditioned offices. Stung by the reaction, officials scrambled to open 19 community centers across the city as makeshift shelters where people could go for lunch. Then, on Thursday, it reversed the policy altogether, announcing that dining in for breakfast and lunch could resume the next day. (Dinner is still limited to takeout or delivery.) The mini-furor tapped into longstanding perceptions that Hong Kong’s policymakers, many of them well-heeled, are out of touch with how most people live. (Carrie Lam, the city’s unpopular leader, was once mocked for not knowing where to buy toilet paper.) Daphne Ho, the organizing secretary of the Construction Site Workers General Union, said many construction workers had crowded together in a covered area for lunch on Wednesday. Others ate at dust-filled, poorly ventilated construction sites, and some opted to skip lunch altogether, she said. “Many people thought, why couldn’t Hong Kongers even have the dignity to eat a meal?” Ms. Ho said. “Why did they have to squat in the streets?” Ms. Chan, the vegetable seller, was relieved on Thursday to be able to eat at one of the converted shelters near her market. A few other residents ate takeout at sparsely distributed tables, all facing the wall, while a pack of reporters waited outside to interview them. Before the shelters were opened, a wide variety of venues — including churches, hotels, clinics, hair salons and art studios — had offered to let people eat in their facilities free. Critics of the government were quick to tie that spirit of grass-roots solidarity to the city’s pro-democracy protest movement, which has seen a variety of mutual aid networks spring up. Health officials have tied Hong Kong’s current surge to incoming travelers who had been exempted from quarantine requirements, including airline crew, sailors and some business executives. (Quarantine rules have since been tightened.) Ben Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, said that unless crowds were present, eating lunch outdoors was a “low-risk activity, but not very comfortable.” But the risks of dining in are also limited, he said, “given the measures that had already been put in place in restaurants, including screens between tables, temperature checks and hand sanitizers.”']","City officials did a quick U-turn in the face of public anger, after viral photos showed workers eating lunch on curbs and bridges in the hot sun."
"Zimbabwe Locks Down Capital, Thwarting Planned Protests",2020-07-31,By Jeffrey Moyo and Patrick Kingsley,"['HARARE, Zimbabwe — When Robert Mugabe was ousted as president of Zimbabwe in a coup in 2017, many in the country hoped for an end to the repression and mismanagement that had characterized his 37 years in office. But when protesters tried to gather on Friday in the capital, Harare, the security services reacted in a manner reminiscent of the Mugabe era. They shut down most of the city, arrested several government critics and forced more than a dozen others into hiding — highlighting how the country has, in the eyes of the opposition, slipped from bad to worse under Mr. Mugabe’s successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mr. Mnangagwa took power on a promise of renewal, but his critics associate him with the same excesses that defined Mr. Mugabe’s legacy: authoritarian rule, financial missteps, rampant graft, plummeting living standards and a teetering economy. “In reality, there is nothing new,” said Obey Sithole, a leading opposition campaigner who went into hiding days before the planned protests. “Instead, we have seen the perfection of the art of repression.” And the government’s halting response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has exposed the awful state of the country’s health care system and led to further allegations of corruption, has fueled widespread anger. In an interview with The Times last year, Mr. Mnangagwa, 77, described himself as a leader with a “new dispensation.” But in some respects, Mr. Mnangagwa — a veteran of the guerrilla war that ended white-minority rule, and one of Mr. Mugabe’s most trusted sidekicks — has proved to be an even harsher president than Mr. Mugabe. The number of opposition activists charged with a form of treason during Mr. Mnangagwa’s three years in office is already higher than during Mr. Mugabe’s entire tenure, according to research by a coalition of 22 Zimbabwean rights groups. Opposition activists hoped to hold mass rallies on Friday, partly in response to a new wave of arrests and abductions that began in May, when three female opposition activists, including a lawmaker, were abducted, beaten and sexually assaulted by people they say were plainclothes government agents. (The government denied involvement and, after being treated in hospital, the women were charged with false accusations.) But Mr. Mnangagwa’s government refused to allow even this largely symbolic expression of dissent. To deter protesters in the prelude to the demonstrations, the police seized the leader of an opposition group who had been helping to organize the rally and a prominent investigative journalist who had helped reveal a possible corruption scheme involving the country’s health minister, Obadiah Moyo. More than a dozen opposition politicians, activists and union leaders, including Mr. Sithole, then went into hiding after the police named them on a wanted list. And on Friday, the police deployed personnel across the city, shutting down most major transit routes and deterring most would-be protesters from gathering. Several of those who did try to assemble said that they had been detained, including the author Tsitsi Dangarembga, three days after her novel “This Mournable Body” was longlisted for the Booker Prize, a prestigious British literary award. “During President Mugabe’s era, there were serious, gross human rights violations,” said Robson Chere, the head of a major teachers’ union, and one of those now in hiding. “But the current so-called new dispensation has gone several gears up.” The situation has led to tensions within Mr. Mnangagwa’s political party. A party official was fired this week after being accused of helping to promote the protests, and the government itself has been forced to deny that the military that brought Mr. Mnangagwa to power was now seeking to oust him. Those hoping to demonstrate on Friday had an extra grievance — Mr. Mnangagwa’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which critics see as reflective of his government’s wider faults. Already close to collapse before the pandemic, hospitals lack enough drugs, ventilators, personal protection equipment and staff, because many doctors and nurses have moved abroad in search of better pay or gone on strike to protest their low wages. Police officers have used coronavirus restrictions as a pretext to arrest the government’s political opponents, according to Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, a watchdog group based in Harare. Mr. Moyo, the health minister, was fired in July after buying coronavirus supplies at inflated prices through a multimillion-dollar contract with an obscure foreign firm that was signed without the approval of the relevant state authorities, according to court documents. Mr. Moyo, who has yet to be replaced, was arrested and is on trial. “The system has collapsed under our president,” said Dr. Peter Magombeyi, a former head of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, a labor union. “We are noticing that there are no doctors, there are no nurses, there are no drugs, not enough personal protective equipment, no hospital C.E.O.s, no health care minister.” The leadership of Mr. Mnangagwa’s party had urged supporters to “take on” the protesters, and attempted to portray the possibility of demonstrations as a Western plot. “None of it is coming from Zimbabweans,” said Tafadzwa Mugwadi, the party’s director of information. Another party official, Patrick Chinamasa, said that the American ambassador to Zimbabwe, Brian A. Nichols, might be expelled from the country, after the U.S. Embassy issued a series of tweets criticizing some of the arrests this month. Mr. Chinamasa said at a news briefing on Monday that if Mr. Nichols were to continue “engaging in acts of mobilizing and funding disturbances, coordinating violence and training fighters,” then “our leadership will not hesitate to give him marching orders.” But in reality, there is plenty of homegrown anger — not only about rights violations, but also about the dire state of the health system and deteriorating living conditions. Corruption and mismanagement have led to the collapse of the economy and vast underinvestment in infrastructure. The situation is compounded by international sanctions on Zimbabwean individuals and institutions, which are potential obstacles to loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Dr. Magombeyi, the former doctors’ union head, provoked widespread horror this week when he shared an image on social media of what he said were the corpses of seven stillborn infants at a single hospital in Harare. Citing doctors at the hospital, Dr. Magombeyi said that the seven had all died on the same night, after a staffing shortage caused delays to their mothers’ prenatal care. Stagnant wages and rampant inflation have made basic medicines unaffordable to most patients. In June, the annual inflation rate was more than 700 percent, devaluing salaries and making common household goods beyond the reach of many citizens. Since the end of Mr. Mugabe’s rule, which was itself marked by profound economic upheaval, the cost of a loaf of bread has risen roughly 70-fold, turning it from a staple into a luxury. In recent months, the country’s electricity crisis has ebbed: Most households no longer face daily power outages, partly because the coronavirus restrictions have caused a drop in demand. But Zimbabweans still face daily water shortages. Parts of Harare receive running water only once or twice a week, forcing many to line up for hours at wells, springs and streams. Against this backdrop, Mr. Mnangagwa caused further anger this week by announcing a plan to raise $3.5 billion through government bond sales to compensate white farmers who were violently expelled from their land under Mr. Mugabe. But there has been no similarly ambitious plan to finance improvements to the health system or water infrastructure. “We have suffered enough,” said Denis Chengeto, a 55-year-old unemployed teacher, speaking ahead of the protests on Thursday. “We have a government that doesn’t care.” But after the government locked down the city on Friday, Mr. Chengeto said he was now too frightened to protest. “Nobody may hear my voice today,” he said on Friday. “I know soldiers won’t hesitate to shoot at anyone if we go on the streets.” Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare; and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.']","Three years after the fall of the strongman Robert Mugabe, the country is in free fall and his successor is clamping down by arresting opposition activists — including an author just nominated for the Booker Prize."
"Border Clashes With Pakistan Leave 15 Afghan Civilians Dead, Officials Say",2020-07-31,By Taimoor Shah and Mujib Mashal,"['KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — Some of the most intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent years left at least 15 civilians dead on the Afghan side on Thursday, officials said. Afghanistan accused Pakistani forces of firing heavy artillery into civilian areas after protests by communities on both sides who were demanding the reopening of a nearby border crossing that Pakistan had closed to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Hayatullah Hayat, the governor of Kandahar Province, where the clashes occurred, said the worst barrage of Pakistani artillery started around 7 p.m. and struck the Spin Boldak area. In addition to the deaths, at least 80 other civilians were wounded, he said. Afghan security officials said they had retaliated with rockets. Social media videos apparently filmed from the Pakistani side showed the dark sky lit up by intense crossfire. A delegation from the local Pakistani government in Baluchistan Province had arrived at the border to assess the situation, officials in Pakistan said. Gen. Yasin Zia, the chief of Afghanistan’s army, has ordered the three army corps stationed along the border areas to be “fully ready to retaliate to the Pakistani military in kind” and put his country’s special forces and air force on the “highest alert,” Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. The ministry estimated the number of dead at nine, including a child. Movement across the porous border had been restricted by the Pakistani side in recent months over concern about the pandemic, which has hit both countries hard. The restrictions particularly affected communities on two sides of the Chaman crossing, people who rely on easy border trade, either as laborers or smugglers, for a living. For several weeks, protesters had staged a sit-in on the Pakistani side of the crossing in Chaman demanding the resumption of normal flow. In June, Pakistan reopened for commercial trucks, but the crossing remained shut for travelers and laborers. The border was opened for travelers stuck on the two sides on Wednesday, but the protest to allow the routine crossing of laborers had continued. The situation grew tense on the Pakistani side on Thursday, with reports of Pakistani forces opening fire on protesters during clashes and killing at least two people. The protesters torched a Covid-19 quarantine facility. When thousands of travelers stuck on the Afghan side rushed for the crossing in the chaos, they were met by Pakistani fire that also struck Afghan border police facilities. The situation erupted into full-on clashes that intensified late into the night, witnesses said. Adeel Ahmad, a provincial official in Baluchistan, said Pakistani security forces had denied they targeted civilians and had only fired shots into the air to disperse protesters and maintain order. “The daily wage workers, especially, who work on both sides of the border are most hard-pressed and have demanded from the government to lift the restrictions on movement and economic activity,” Mr. Ahmed said. “The locals say that we can no longer tolerate hunger and unemployment and want a solution to the current impasse. The locals are also resisting the government’s plans to introduce passport and biometric systems for cross-border movement.” Afghan officials and residents in Spin Boldak District said heavy artillery fire from the Pakistani side forced hundreds of families to flee their homes from border villages last night. The clashes at the southern border came just a week after Afghan officials said Pakistani forces had fired dozens of mortar shells into the Sarkano District of eastern Kunar Province, killing eight civilians. The two countries share a long border, about 1,500 miles, that was drawn by the British in the 19th century and that left ethnic Pashtun tribes split. Consecutive Afghan governments have questioned the legitimacy of the division, known as the Durand Line, as an official border. Efforts by Pakistan’s government to build reinforced fences and security checkpoints along the border have angered Afghan officials and communities in the area. Taimoor Shah reported from Kandahar and Mujib Mashal from Kabul, Afghanistan.

Lawmakers ‘Alarmed’ by Reports U.S. Envoy Told Brazil It Could Help Re-elect Trump,2020-07-31,"By Ernesto Londoño, Manuela Andreoni and Letícia Casado","['RIO DE JANEIRO — Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Friday they were “extremely alarmed” by assertions that the American ambassador in Brazil had signaled to Brazilian officials they could help get President Trump re-elected by changing their trade policies. In a letter sent Friday afternoon, Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel demanded that the ambassador, Todd Chapman, produce “any and all documents referring or related to any discussions” he has held with Brazilian officials in recent weeks about their nation’s tariffs on ethanol, an important agricultural export for Iowa, a potential swing state in the American presidential election. The committee’s letter was sent in response to reports in the Brazilian news media this week saying that Mr. Chapman, a career diplomat, made it clear to Brazilian officials they could bolster Mr. Trump’s electoral chances in Iowa if Brazil lifted its ethanol tariffs. Eliminating tariffs would give the Trump administration a welcome trade victory to present to struggling ethanol producers in Iowa, where the president is in a close race with his Democratic rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr. The House committee said it was opening an inquiry into the matter. The State Department said Friday afternoon in an emailed statement that “allegations suggesting that Ambassador Chapman has asked Brazilians to support a specific U.S. candidate are false.” The statement added: “The United States has long been focused on reducing tariff barriers and will continue do so.” The O Globo newspaper published a story on Thursday saying Mr. Chapman had underscored “the importance to the Brazilian government of keeping Donald Trump” in office. Mr. Bolsonaro, a far-right leader, has made closer alignment with the Trump administration his top foreign policy priority. A competing newspaper, Estadão, published an article Friday saying its reporters independently confirmed that the ambassador framed his argument against tariffs in partisan terms. The article said the Brazilian officials who met with Mr. Chapman rejected the appeal, declining to be drawn into the American presidential battle. Neither article named its sources. But Alceu Moreira, a Brazilian congressman who heads the agricultural caucus, told The New York Times in an interview that Mr. Chapman had made repeated references to the electoral calendar during a recent meeting the two had about ethanol. He said that Mr. Chapman did not explicitly urge him to help the Trump campaign or bring up the contest in Iowa — but that the American ambassador did tie the ethanol issue to the election. “He said, ‘You know, we have elections in the United States, and that this is very important,’” Mr. Moreira said, recounting their conversation. “He said this four or five times.” In the letter, Mr. Engel said that if Mr. Chapman had pressured the Brazilians to help the Trump campaign, it could be a violation of the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that bars federal officials from engaging in certain partisan activities. “These statements are completely inappropriate for a U.S. ambassador to make,” Mr. Engel, a Democrat from New York, wrote in the letter, which was also signed by Representative Albio Sires, who chairs the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Civilian Security and Trade. The letter called on Mr. Chapman to “reassure Congress and the American people that our Ambassador to Brazil is truly representing the interests of the United States and not the narrow, political interests of President Trump."" Promoting favorable terms for American industries abroad is a core priority for American ambassadors. But American diplomats are reminded in election years to steer clear of any actions that might reasonably be construed as partisan. The committee’s letter also took issue with Mr. Chapman’s defense of a video promoting the Trump campaign that Eduardo Bolsonaro, a federal lawmaker and a son of President Jair Bolsonaro, posted Sunday on Twitter. The video ends with a slide that says “Trump 2020: The Great Victory.” Asked about the video in an interview with O Globo, Mr. Chapman said he saw no problem with Eduardo Bolsonaro’s endorsement. “I’m a big defender of freedom of expression,” Mr. Chapman told the newspaper. “And everyone is free to say who they like and who they’re against as they see fit; I’m not going to tell someone they can’t speak in favor or against my president.” Mr. Engel and Mr. Sires, a Democrat from New Jersey, said the ambassador should have responded differently. “While Mr. Bolsonaro has the right to speak freely, it is simply not appropriate for sitting government officials — in any branch of government — to promote the campaigns of candidates in the United States,” the congressmen wrote. “We frankly believe that you should know better.” Eduardo Bolsonaro is the rare Brazilian official who has openly supported lowering ethanol tariffs for American sellers. In a video he posted last September, he said taking a hit on ethanol would be a boon for Brazilian exporters of meat and sugar by improving the chances of a free-trade agreement between the two countries. “That could bring so many benefits to us as Brazilians,” said the younger Mr. Bolsonaro, an ardent supporter of Mr. Trump who wore a “Make Brazil Great Again” baseball cap during a visit to the White House last year. The United States has long pushed Brazil to lower tariffs on ethanol. Those talks gained a new sense of urgency in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic led to plummeting demand, and American ethanol sellers were squeezed by the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. Currently, American ethanol companies can sell up to 750 million liters of ethanol to Brazil per year without paying tariffs. Any sales beyond that are subject to a 20 percent tax. The Brazilian government raised the tariff-free cap last September from 600 million liters — a gesture intended to give Brazilian sugar producers greater access to the American market. Mr. Trump hailed that move, calling it “great progress for our Farmers.” But Washington did not make good on the sugar access, which left the Brazilians feeling embittered. The current ethanol tariff framework is set to expire in August. If the two countries don’t reach a deal, Brazil will apply a 20 percent tax to all ethanol imports, a blow to an industry that is pleading for government bailouts. Mr. Moreira, the Brazilian congressman who heads the agricultural caucus, said he told Mr. Chapman that Brazilian politicians also had political considerations to consider, given coming municipal elections in November. Ethanol producers in Brazil’s northeast states would look dimly on tariff rules that put them at a competitive disadvantage. “Is the ethanol producer very important electorally speaking? Yes, very important,” Mr. Moreira said. “We very much like the American people, but we like our people more.” Congressman Arnaldo Jardim, who leads a Brazilian congressional bloc that supports ethanol producers, said Mr. Chapman has been negotiating with a sense of urgency as the deadline approaches. “Let’s just say he’s putting pressure” on Brazilian officials, said Mr. Jardim, adding that he had not personally met with the ambassador about this issue, but regularly speaks to several officials who have. “He’s saying that this is paramount for the United States and paramount for Trump.” Orlando Ribeiro, who heads the department of commercial and international relations at Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, said that negotiators had hoped to reach a deal on ethanol tariffs before the August deadline that took into account the interests of all stakeholders. Barring that, he said he feared Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro could hash out a deal over the phone at the last minute. “What could happen is that on the eve, Trump could call Bolsonaro and they might decide to lift all” tariffs, he said.']",The House Foreign Affairs Committee has begun an inquiry into multiple reports in the Brazilian media that the U.S. ambassador was framing negotiations over ethanol tariffs in partisan terms.
How Italy Turned Around Its Coronavirus Calamity,2020-07-31,By Jason Horowitz,"['ROME — When the coronavirus erupted in the West, Italy was the nightmarish epicenter, a place to avoid at all costs and a shorthand in the United States and much of Europe for uncontrolled contagion. “You look at what’s going on with Italy,” President Trump told reporters on March 17. “We don’t want to be in a position like that.” Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, used Italy’s overwhelmed hospitals as evidence for his opposition to Medicare for All at a presidential debate. “It is not working in Italy right now,” he said. Fast forward a few months, and the United States has suffered tens of thousands more deaths than any country in the world. European states that once looked smugly at Italy are facing new flare-ups. Some are imposing fresh restrictions and weighing whether to lock down again. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Friday announced a delay to a planned easing of measures in England as the infection rate there rose. Even Germany, lauded for its efficient response and rigorous contact tracing, has warned that lax behavior is prompting a surge in cases. And Italy? Its hospitals are basically empty of Covid-19 patients. Daily deaths attributed to the virus in Lombardy, the northern region that bore the brunt of the pandemic, hover around zero. The number of new daily cases has plummeted to “one of the lowest in Europe and the world,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the National Institute of Health. “We have been very prudent.” And lucky. Today, despite a tiny uptick in cases this week, Italians are cautiously optimistic that they have the virus in check — even as Italy’s leading health experts warn that complacency remains the jet fuel of the pandemic. They are aware that the picture can change at any moment. How Italy has gone from being a global pariah to a model — however imperfect — of viral containment holds fresh lessons for the rest of the world, including the United States, where the virus, never under control, now rages across the country. After a stumbling start, Italy has consolidated, or at least maintained, the rewards of a tough nationwide lockdown through a mix of vigilance and painfully gained medical expertise. Its government has been guided by scientific and technical committees. Local doctors, hospitals and health officials collect more than 20 indicators on the virus daily and send them to regional authorities, who then forward them to the National Institute of Health. The result is a weekly X-ray of the country’s health upon which policy decisions are based. That is a long way from the state of panic, and near collapse, that hit Italy in March. This week, Parliament voted to extend the government’s emergency powers through Oct. 15 after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte argued the nation could not let its guard down “because the virus is still circulating.” Those powers allow the government to keep restrictions in place and respond quickly — including with lockdowns — to any new clusters. The government has already imposed travel restrictions on more than a dozen countries to Italy, as the importation of the virus from countries is now the government’s greatest fear. “There are a lot of situations in France, Spain, the Balkans, which means that the virus is not off at all,” said Ranieri Guerra, assistant director general for strategic initiatives at the World Health Organization and an Italian doctor. “It can come back at any time.” There is no doubt that the privations of the lockdown were economically costly. For three months, businesses and restaurants were ordered closed, movement was highly restricted — even between regions, towns and streets — and tourism ground to a halt. Italy is expected to lose about 10 percent of its gross domestic product this year. But at a certain point, as the virus threatened to spread uncontrollably, Italian officials decided to put lives ahead of the economy. “The health of the Italian people comes and will always come first,” Mr. Conte said at the time. Italian officials now hope that the worst of the cure came in one large dose — the painful lockdown — and that the country is now safe to resume normal life, albeit with limits. They argue that the only way to start up the economy is to keep tamping down the virus, even now. The strategy of closing down completely invited criticism that the government’s excessive caution was paralyzing the economy. But it may prove to be more advantageous than trying to reopen the economy while the virus still rages, as is happening in countries like the United States, Brazil and Mexico. That does not mean that calls for continued vigilance, as elsewhere in the world, have been immune to mockery, resistance and exasperation. In that, Italy is no different. Masks often are missing or lowered in trains or buses, where they are mandatory. Young people are going out and doing the things young people do — and risk in that way spreading the virus to more susceptible parts of the population. Adults started gathering at the beach and for birthday barbecues. There is still no clear plan for a return to school in September. There is also a burgeoning, and politically motivated, anti-mask contingent led by nationalist Matteo Salvini, who on July 27 declared that replacing handshakes and hugs with elbow bumps was “the end of the human species.” At his rallies, Mr. Salvini, the leader of the populist League party, still shakes hands and wears his mask like a chin guard. In July, during a news conference, he accused the Italian government of “importing” infected immigrants to create new clusters and extend the state of emergency. This week, Mr. Salvini joined other mask skeptics — nicknamed the “negationists” by critics — for a protest in the Senate library, along with special guests such as the Italian crooner Andrea Bocelli, who said he did not believe the pandemic was so serious because “I know a lot of people and I don’t know anyone who ended up in an I.C.U.” But the country’s leading health experts say that the lack of severe cases is indicative of a decrease in the volume of infections, as only a small percentage of the infected get very sick. And so far, Italy’s malcontents have not been numerous or powerful enough to undermine what has been a hard-won trajectory of success in confronting the virus after a calamitous start. Italy’s initial isolation by European neighbors at the outset of the crisis, when masks and ventilators were hardly pouring in from across the borders, may actually have helped, Mr. Guerra, the W.H.O. expert, said. “There was competition initially, there was no collaboration,” Mr. Guerra said. “And everyone acknowledged Italy was left alone at that time.” As a result, he said, “what they had to do at that time because we were left alone turned out to be more effective than other countries.” Italy first quarantined towns and then the Lombardy region in the north and then the entire peninsula and its islands, despite the near absence of the virus in much of central and southern Italy. That not only prevented workers in the industrial north from returning home in the much more vulnerable south, but it also fostered and forced a unified national response. During the lockdown, movement was strictly limited, between regions and towns and even city blocks, and people had to fill in “auto-certification” forms to prove that they needed to go outside for work, health or “other necessities.” Masks and social distancing regulations were enforced by some regional authorities with steep fines. Generally, if grudgingly, the rules were followed. As searing scenes of human suffering, empty streets and the heavy toll on an elderly generation of northern Italians spread, the transmission rate of the virus quickly decreased, and the curve flattened, as opposed to other European countries, such as Sweden, which pursued an alternative to locking down. That the initial outbreak was localized in the overwhelmed hospitals created enormous stress, but it also enabled doctors and nurses to expedite contact tracing. Then the country reopened, gradually, expanding liberties at two-week intervals to respond to the virus’s incubation period. The lockdown eventually had a secondary effect of decreasing the volume of virus circulating in society, and thus reducing the probability of coming in contact with someone who had it. At the end of the lockdown, the virus circulation had steeply fallen off and in some central and southern regions, there were hardly any chains of transmission at all. “It’s always a matter of probability with these pathogens,” said Mr. Guerra, adding that new early alarm systems such as the monitoring of wastewater for traces of virus had lowered the probability of infection even more. Some Italian doctors say they believe that the virus is now behaving differently in Italy. Matteo Bassetti, an infectious-disease doctor in the northwestern city of Genoa, said that during the height of the crisis, his hospital was inundated with 500 Covid-19 cases at one time. Now, he said, his intensive care unit, with 50 beds, has no coronavirus patients, and the 60-bed Covid-19 unit built specially for the crisis is empty. He said he thought that the virus had weakened — an unproven view, he acknowledged, that has nonetheless found an eager audience in Mr. Salvini and other politicians opposed to extending the state of emergency. Most health experts said that the virus still loomed, and as the government considers a new decree to reopen night clubs, festivals and cruise ship travel, many of them have implored the country not to let down its guard. “Even if the situation is better than in other countries, we should continue to be very prudent,” said Dr. Rezza of the National Institute of Health, adding that he thought the question of what Italy had done right was better posed “at the end of the epidemic.” “We cannot exclude that we will have outbreaks in Italy in the next few days,” he said. “Maybe it’s just a matter of time.” Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Milan.']","After a stumbling start, the country has gone from being a global pariah to a model — however imperfect — of viral containment that holds lessons for its neighbors and for the United States."
Scorching Temperatures Bake Middle East Amid Eid al-Adha Celebrations,2020-07-31,By Falih Hassan and Elian Peltier,"['BAGHDAD — A sweltering 125 degrees Fahrenheit in Baghdad on Tuesday; a record 115 degrees in Damascus on Wednesday. And extreme levels of heat in Israel and Lebanon. Several countries in the Middle East experienced record high temperatures this week as many marked the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha amid the coronavirus pandemic. The heat wave left cities sweltering in scorching temperatures of 120 degrees (48 degrees Celsius) or more for days, raising concerns it was a sign of future misery under the warming effects of climate change. Iraq has been hit especially hard, with Baghdad recording its all-time highest temperature on Tuesday, followed by its second hottest day on record on Wednesday. The southern city of Basra also recorded temperatures of 120 degrees and higher for days, with the mercury hitting 122 degrees on Thursday, a temperature also recorded in Amara, in the southeast. “The heat is unbearable,” said Ahmed Hashim, a 30-year-old Baghdad resident. “There’s a psychological pressure, people can easily get into a fight.” Mr. Hashim said he had seen people faint from the heat in the streets of the Iraqi capital. Some have tried to find respite from the scorching temperatures in public fountains. The heat wave is hitting Iraq as the country struggles with a worsening shortage of electricity, which has pushed people to rely even more on private generators to power refrigerators, air-conditioners and fans. Mr. Hashim said generators were being switched off every few hours because of power cuts, worsening the misery. “The cooler in the house cannot cool the rooms — electricity is a disaster,” he added. Two protesters were killed by security forces in Baghdad on Monday in demonstrations over the worsening lack of electricity. The killings were the first in months near Tahrir Square, which became a symbol of protests against endemic corruption and foreign interference last year during a monthslong period of unrest. On Thursday, Iraqi authorities ordered a nationwide eight-day holiday for Eid al-Adha to bring some relief across the country. Meteorologists define a heat wave as a prolonged period of unusually high temperatures that span across several days, usually three. Combined with high humidity or the lack of cool temperatures at night, extreme temperatures pose risks to the elderly and children. With average worldwide temperatures rising as a result of carbon dioxide emissions and other heat-trapping gases, periods of extreme heat are becoming more frequent and more intense, with the situation particularly dire near the Equator. But cooler regions have not been spared. Intense heat afflicted Europe this week, a year after extreme temperatures soared across the continent, and several cities like Paris and Glasgow recorded all-time high temperatures. And a study of a prolonged heat wave in Siberia earlier this year found that global warming made the extreme temperatures 600 times more likely there. Temperatures regularly go above 115 degrees in the summer in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Amman, Jordan; and Baghdad; 120-degree days are no longer exceptional. But meteorologists have warned that the current heat wave may be longer and more widespread across the region. A report about climate change in the Middle East published by the United Nations in 2017 estimated that average temperatures could increase nearly 10 degrees in certain areas of the region by the end of the century, and that the number of days over 104 degrees would increase significantly. The number of nights per year where temperatures remain above 68 degrees Fahrenheit may also jump from 40 to 80 or 90 by the end of the century in the region, said Paolo Ruti, a meteorologist and the director of the World Weather Research Program at the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency. At Houche al Oumara in Lebanon, temperatures rose to nearly 114 degrees — one of the hottest temperatures ever recorded in the country. Temperatures also soared across much of Israel this week, reaching 111 degrees at the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, and 103 in the northern city of Tiberias. Climate experts said the heat wave was part of a trend of warmer summer temperatures across Israel. “This heat wave didn’t break any records,” said Hadas Saaroni, a professor of climatology at Tel Aviv University. “But over the past three decades, we have witnessed higher temperatures as well as longer summers and heat waves.” Even as countries in the Middle East deal with the crippling heat, they are struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected hundreds of thousands of people in the region. In May, the World Meteorological Organization warned that the pandemic would increase health risks caused by high temperatures, forcing people to congregate indoors in air-conditioned public spaces, while leaving vulnerable people more exposed to heat stroke. In Saudi Arabia, where the temperature hit 115 degrees in its capital, Riyadh, the pandemic has pushed authorities to sharply reduce the number of pilgrims undertaking the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. In Iraq, Jowdat Abdul Rahman, a spokesman of the country’s civil defense forces, said the heat wave’s impact had been aggravated by the pandemic. “Iraqis used to go to swimming pools when temperatures would rise, while now, they can’t,” he said. And for the first time, he said, birds are dying because of the heat. “I had never seen such a thing before.” Falih Hassan reported from Baghdad, and Elian Peltier from London.

"In Indonesia, False Virus Cures Pushed by Those Who Should Know Better",2020-07-31,By Richard C. Paddock,"['First, Indonesia’s agriculture minister promoted wearing a necklace containing a eucalyptus potion to cure the coronavirus. Not to be outdone, the governor of Bali, a popular resort island, pushed his own remedy: inhaling the steam from boiled arak, a traditional alcohol made from coconuts. So-called influencers and self-styled experts have also pushed their own quack cures and misinformation on Indonesian social media, including a widely spread rumor that popular infrared thermometer guns cause brain damage. As Indonesia steadily loses ground to the pandemic, the government has had difficulty delivering a consistent, science-based message about the coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19. As of Friday, Indonesia had reported more than 108,000 cases and more than 5,130 deaths, surpassing China in both categories. Yet even in hard-hit provinces, as many as 70 percent of people go without masks and ignore social distancing requirements, according to the government, often crowding into shops and markets and hanging out at busy cafes and restaurants. Indonesia is not the only country battling misinformation or whose leaders have promoted quack remedies. The World Health Organization has called the ubiquity of hazardous false information an “infodemic.” In Kenya, the governor of Nairobi has pushed cognac as a miracle cure. President Trump has continued to promote hydroxychloroquine, a drug used for treating malaria, as a coronavirus remedy despite medical evidence to the contrary. He has even suggested that an “injection inside” the human body with a disinfectant like bleach could help combat the virus. But Indonesia is unique because of its large population, expansive geography across thousands of islands and mix of cultural identities. It would be difficult enough for the government to implement a clear and unified plan for combating the virus, but matters have been made worse by the promotion of muddled and often dangerous information. The country’s president, Joko Widodo, had initially downplayed the pandemic and has delivered mixed messages. He admitted in March that he had misled the public about the virus to prevent a panic. After that, he was slow to close businesses and schools and to limit travel, but was quick to lift restrictions even as cases continued to rise. In May, he said Indonesia should learn to live with the virus. A month later, however, he threatened to fire cabinet ministers for not doing more to bring the pandemic under control. This month, he called for a national campaign to promote better discipline in social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing. In the absence of a unified message from the national government, local officials and opportunists have filled the gap. One official who has promoted a questionable remedy is the agriculture minister, Syahrul Yasin Limpo. He told reporters this month that a ministry laboratory had developed a potion made from eucalyptus that when worn on a necklace could kill 80 percent of virus particles in half an hour. “From 700 species of eucalyptus, our lab test results showed that one kind could kill the corona,” he said. “We are certain. We will produce it next month.” His claim was quickly contradicted by health experts, including the head of the laboratory that developed the aromatic potion, who said it was not effective against the coronavirus. But that didn’t stop others from promoting it. A popular singer, Iis Dahlia, met with Mr. Joko as he sought to recruit celebrities to help in his health campaign. Soon after, she informed her 12 million Instagram followers that she was proud to be wearing the amulet. “This eucalyptus necklace,” she said, “makes me feel safe and protected from the virus.” In Bali, the governor, I Wayan Koster, has promoted a local treatment: inhaling the steam of boiled arak, a traditional alcoholic beverage. As if to stay on trend, he too recommends adding a dash of eucalyptus oil. The governor, who has a Ph.D. in education and described himself as a former “researcher,” told a news conference last week that nearly 80 percent of those who inhaled the concoction tested negative sooner than would have been expected. The treatment has not been subjected to scientific testing, but he said he hoped that Bali could patent and produce it. The government’s top coronavirus spokesman, Wiku Adisasmito, urged the public to follow health guidelines and not to rely on superstition and half-baked treatments, even when they emanate from public officials and celebrities. “At times of emergency, we all need honest, scientifically based, real facts to bring us hope, calm and clarity,” said Mr. Adisasmito, a University of Indonesia health policy professor. Jusuf Kalla, a former vice president who now heads the Indonesian Red Cross, said the country got off to a slow start in fighting the pandemic in part because the health minister, Terawan Agus Putranto, minimized its severity. “Until March, Minister Terawan was like Trump, saying, ‘Oh, this is only a simple flu,’” Mr. Kalla said. “But now, Minister Terawan is very realistic. Ministers and governors are trying to come up with solutions in an uncertain situation. It is trial and error.” Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, and some citizens and officials have leaned on their faith to promote cures and guide their understanding of the disease. On Lombok Island, a top official suggested that niqabs, loose Islamic veils worn by  women, were as effective in preventing the spread of the virus as snug-fitting medical face masks. “The advantage of the niqab is more ease in breathing,” Suhaili Fadhil Thohir, the regent of Central Lombok, explained in an interview. Nevertheless, the Covid task force for the province, West Nusa Tenggara, continues to call for face masks, said Artanto, a police spokesman and task force member. “The regent still wears a mask, not a niqab,” said Mr. Artanto, who like many Indonesians uses one name. “We keep educating people to wear a mask.” For many Muslims, the Covid-19 burial protocol of wrapping the body tightly in plastic and burying it in a designated cemetery has been difficult to accept. By tradition, Muslim family members wash the body of the deceased and wrap it in cloth for burial. The authorities say there have been many cases around the country of families rejecting doctors’ warnings and taking Covid-positive bodies home for burial. In Mataram, Lombok’s main city, relatives of a woman who died in a motorcycle accident this month refused to believe doctors who said she had tested positive. About 100 men stormed into Mataram’s government hospital to claim the body. Officers tried to explain the importance of the burial protocols. But they were badly outnumbered, and the men took the body, put it in a taxi and drove away. “It happens all over Indonesia,” Mr. Artanto said. “Their understanding as people who live in the village is different from those of us who live in the city.” Mr. Adisasmito said that Islamic burial traditions were deeply ingrained, and that it was hard for people to accept that they must change. He likened it to Americans who refuse to wear a mask because it obstructs their “pre-pandemic liberty, habits and way of life.” “We live in a diverse globe,” he said, “and different communities have distinctive values that they hold on to.” Muktita Suhartono and Dera Menra Sijabat contributed reporting.']","In the absence of a unified message from the national government, local officials and opportunists have filled the gap with misinformation and quack remedies."
"Hong Kong Delays Election, Citing Coronavirus. The Opposition Isn’t Buying It.",2020-07-31,By Austin Ramzy,"['HONG KONG — The Hong Kong government said on Friday that it would postpone the city’s September legislative election by one year because of the coronavirus pandemic, a decision seen by the pro-democracy opposition as a brazen attempt to thwart its electoral momentum and avoid the defeat of pro-Beijing candidates. “It is a really tough decision to delay, but we want to ensure fairness, public safety and public health,” said Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive. She cited the risk of infections, with as many as three million or more people expected to vote on the same day; the inability of candidates to hold campaign events due to social distancing rules; and the difficulties faced by eligible voters who are overseas or in mainland China and cannot return to cast ballots because of travel restrictions. The delay was a blow to opposition politicians, who had hoped to ride to victory in the fall on a wave of deep-seated dissatisfaction with the government and concerns about a sweeping new national security law imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong. And it was the latest in a quick series of aggressive moves by the pro-Beijing establishment that had the effect of sidelining the pro-democracy movement. On Thursday, 12 pro-democracy candidates said they had been barred from running, including four sitting lawmakers and several prominent activists like Joshua Wong. Mr. Wong said he was barred in part because of his criticism of the new security law.  “Clearly it is the largest election fraud in #HK’s history,” Mr. Wong wrote on Twitter after Mrs. Lam announced the postponement.  Even before Friday, the city’s pro-democracy opposition had accused the government of using social-distancing rules to clamp down on the protest movement that began more than a year ago. Earlier this week, amid reports that the vote might be delayed, Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy legislator running for re-election, said that China’s ruling Communist Party was ordering “a strategic retreat.” They “want to avoid a potential devastating defeat” in the election, he wrote on Twitter. The explanation that Hong Kong must delay the vote because of the pandemic is likely to fall flat among the wider public, said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “I think it will be seen as a kind of manipulation, that the government is afraid of losing the majority and that is why they postponed the election,” he said. Mrs. Lam denied that the decision had been influenced by political concerns. “It is purely on the basis of protecting the health and safety of the Hong Kong people and to ensure that the elections are held in a fair and open manner,” she said. While Hong Kong has been a world leader in controlling the coronavirus, in recent days it has seen its worst surge of infections yet, with more than 100 new cases reported daily for more than a week. The government has unfurled several new lockdown and social-distancing measures. “We face a dire situation in our fight against the virus,” Mrs. Lam said. Under Hong Kong law, an election can be delayed for up to 14 days if there is a “danger to public health or safety.” But Mrs. Lam postponed the election until Sept. 5, 2021, under emergency powers that allow the chief executive to make any regulations considered to be “desirable in the public interest.”  Those powers, which date to the British colonial era, were invoked last year when the government banned the wearing of masks in an effort to stem protests. China’s central government said it supported Mrs. Lam’s decision to delay the election, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.  Mrs. Lam acknowledged that the move created a “rather thorny issue” under the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution, which limits the terms of Legislative Council members to four years — meaning that the current lawmakers’ terms will soon expire.  That matter will be referred to the standing committee of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, which has the power to interpret the Basic Law, for a decision on how to deal with the gap, Xinhua reported.  The postponement will likely be met with criticism from the United States and other countries that have expressed sharp disapproval of China’s tightening grip on Hong Kong. This month, President Trump said that because of the national security law, the United States would begin to curb its special treatment of Hong Kong and deal with it more in line with the rest of China. The elections “must proceed on time,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday in a U.S. radio interview. “They must be held. The people of Hong Kong deserve to have their voice represented by the elected officials that they choose in those elections.” “If they destroy that, if they take that down, it will be another marker that will simply prove that the Chinese Communist Party has now made Hong Kong just another Communist-run city,” he added. Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Friday that the Hong Kong election was “a local election in China and is purely China’s internal affair.”  The national security law targets activity that it describes as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. It has stirred concerns in Hong Kong because it allows mainland security services to operate openly in the city and makes some speech, such as advocating Hong Kong’s independence, illegal. On Wednesday, in a sign that officials would strictly enforce the law, the police arrested four activists, ages 16 to 21, who were accused of supporting separatism in social media posts.  And the next day, in barring the 12 opposition candidates, the Hong Kong government said that the grounds for disqualifying them included advocating for Hong Kong’s independence or self-determination, soliciting intervention from foreign governments, expressing an objection in principle to the national security law Beijing imposed last month, or vowing to indiscriminately vote against government proposals. Opposition candidates say the moves suggested that pro-Beijing officials were concerned about a resounding defeat in the September election. Even establishment candidates have been quietly discussing the potential for a pan-democratic wave.  Elections for neighborhood-level offices, held last November, were seen as a warning: The opposition took control of 17 out of 18 district councils, which had normally been controlled by pro-Beijing parties. This year, the opposition set its sights on a bigger target: to take at least half the 70 seats in the Legislative Council, the top lawmaking body in the territory. While the protests have abated in recent weeks under the authorities’ crackdown, discontent with the government has remained strong since Beijing imposed the security law on Hong Kong, a semiautonomous city that maintains its own local government and legal system. Two weeks ago, more than 600,000 people participated in the opposition camp’s primary election, despite warnings from local officials that it might be illegal. Voters generally preferred candidates closely associated with the past year’s protests. In barring the candidates for the September elections, election officials questioned whether candidates who had previously lobbied foreign governments would continue to do so, which could potentially violate the new security law’s prohibitions on foreign influence. Another question asked was whether candidates, if elected, would veto the government’s budget. Under Hong Kong’s system, if the legislature blocks the budget twice in a row, the chief executive is forced to step down. Kwok Ka-ki, a legislator who was one of the 12 candidates disqualified Thursday, replied that such a question was political in nature, and that he was unsure why an election official had any business asking it. “After all, this is why there are elections in the first place,” he wrote. Just half the seats in the legislature represent geographic districts in Hong Kong, another barrier for the pro-democracy camp. The other half are functional constituencies largely set aside for candidates from various commercial sectors, which tend to vote for establishment candidates. The opposition has pointed to other places that have held successful elections during the pandemic, including South Korea and Singapore. “I don’t think many people in Hong Kong will be convinced,” Mr. Ma said, referring to the official justification for delaying the election. “They are allowed to go to work, take the subway, take the bus, stand in long queues and then not allowed to vote? It won’t be very convincing.” Elaine Yu and Tiffany May contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

"With Security Law as a Cudgel, Beijing Cracks Down on Hong Kong",2020-07-31,"By Keith Bradsher, Elaine Yu and Steven Lee Myers","['BEIJING — For weeks, as Beijing quickly drafted and imposed a stringent new national security law for Hong Kong, many in the territory feared the rules would be used to intimidate the opposition, but hoped they would not presage a broad crackdown. Now those hopes have been dashed. Brushing aside international criticism and sanctions, the Chinese government has used the letter and spirit of the law to crush Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition with surprising ferocity. In the last week alone, the authorities have ousted a tenured law professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been a key figure in the city’s democracy movement, and arrested four young activists on suspicion that they expressed support online for independence. They have also barred a dozen candidates from running for the legislature, using opposition to the security law as new ground for disqualification. On Friday, the authorities postponed for a year the election itself, which had been scheduled for Sept. 6. While they cited the coronavirus pandemic as justification for the move, it underscored Beijing’s fears that pro-democracy candidates could triumph. The breadth and severity of the actions reflect Beijing’s urgency to smother opposition to its encroaching authority over the territory after more than a year of political upheaval there. “More will come,” said Victoria Tin-bor Hui, a political scientist from Hong Kong at University of Notre Dame. The aggressive consolidation of power mirrors China’s broader moves to flex its political, economic and military might as the world is distracted by the pandemic. Western nations have pushed back aggressively against Beijing’s measures, imposing sanctions and even suspending extradition agreements with Hong Kong, but to no avail. In some ways, it appears to have emboldened China, which blames the dissent in Hong Kong on foreign interference. “The people of Hong Kong deserve to have their voice represented by the elected officials that they choose in those elections,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a radio interview on Thursday ahead of the postponement of the election. “If they destroy that, if they take that down, it will be another marker that will simply prove that the Chinese Communist Party has now made Hong Kong just another communist-run city.” Wang Wenbin, the chief spokesman of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Beijing was allowing the Hong Kong authorities to decide the timing of the election. But he also insisted that Beijing would not be dissuaded by any foreign countries from doing what it deems necessary in Hong Kong. “China is not afraid of intimidation by any external forces — our determination is unwavering and unshakable in safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests,” he said. On the mainland, China thoroughly stifles political dissent. For the authorities there, Hong Kong — with its nominal political autonomy and robust democracy movement — has been a major irritant, especially after huge protests openly and at times violently challenged Beijing’s control and even sovereignty over the city last year. With its crackdown, Beijing is following the authoritarian playbook of countries like Russia, holding elections but managing them so that they cease to reflect genuine voter will. Russia’s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, recently orchestrated a constitutional referendum to perpetuate his rule — and then followed it up with a series of arrests, hoping to smother discontent before it could gain momentum. “They are running short of confidence to face the people, to face the people’s choice, to face the people’s demands,” said Alvin Yeung, a sitting pro-democracy lawmaker from the moderate Civic Party who was disqualified from running on Thursday. “It’s fear.” Years in the making, the national security law created a climate of fear and uncertainty in only a matter of hours after it was imposed. The day the law took effect, the police detained 10 protesters for national security violations, including a young man on a motorcycle with a Hong Kong liberation flag who collided with police officers. Tong Ying-kit, who was hospitalized after the collision, was later the first charged under the new law. He remains in custody. The newly created agency to enforce the law, the Office for Safeguarding National Security, soon took up residence in the Metropark Hotel in Causeway Bay (a 4.5 rating on Tripadvisor.com) and surrounded it with barricades in a physical manifestation of Beijing’s growing authoritarian footprint on the city. The agency is headed by Zheng Yanxiong, a senior Communist Party official dispatched from Guangdong, the neighboring province on the mainland. He is best known for his hostility to a short-lived democracy experiment in a Guangdong village, Wukan, nearly a decade ago. On July 10, the Hong Kong police raided an independent polling institute whose computers were being used by democracy supporters for an unofficial primary to decide which candidates would run for the legislature. Five days later, the police arrested five activists, including a vice chairman of the territory’s Democratic Party, in connection with protests and violent clashes at Hong Kong Polytechnic University last November. The four young activists arrested on Wednesday were all former members of Studentlocalism, a pro-independence group led by secondary school students that ended its operations just before the security law took effect. In the past, the group had typically distributed leaflets supporting independence outside schools. Regina Ip, a cabinet member and the leader of a small pro-Beijing political party in the legislature, welcomed the arrest on Wednesday of the four activists, who ranged in age from 16 to 21. She said that their postings showed continued support for Hong Kong independence after the law went into effect, although the police have not elaborated on what the four specifically said. Their arrest shows that the authorities are “acting in accordance with the law,” she said. On Friday evening, Chinese state television reported that the Hong Kong police had issued warrants for the arrests of six democracy advocates who are now overseas. They are wanted on charges of promoting secession and colluding with foreign forces, according to the report — crimes that are punishable with life imprisonment under the security law. The police declined to comment.  One of the six, Samuel Chu, said on Twitter that he had been an American citizen for 25 years.  Also on Friday, Hong Kong’s secretary for justice said that David Leung, the city’s British-trained director of prosecutions, had submitted his resignation. Pro-Beijing politicians and the police had accused Mr. Leung of being too cautious about bringing charges against protesters, though he had prosecuted some high-profile activists. Mr. Leung did not issue a statement. The spirit of the security law has been used to justify the dismissal of the professor at the University of Hong Kong, Benny Tai. After the rollout of the rules, Mr. Tai, who was convicted of public nuisance for his role in protests in 2014, helped organize the recent primary vote for the pro-democracy camp. Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong supported his removal, describing it in a statement as “a just act of punishing evil and promoting good and conforming to the people’s will.” The security law was also invoked this week for the disqualifications of candidates for the legislature. The legislature cannot have seats “for these unscrupulous individuals who are plotting to destroy” Hong Kong, the liaison office said. The Hong Kong government said that candidates who objected “in principle” to Beijing’s enactment of the law were violating the oath to uphold Hong Kong’s constitution. The government also said it was unconstitutional to vow to block its legislative proposals in order to pressure the administration. Some opposition lawmakers had floated the idea of voting down the government’s budget. Under Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, that could force the resignation of the chief executive, Carrie Lam, and new elections. The yearlong delay in the election now gives the authorities time to disqualify more pro-democracy candidates from running and quash any remaining momentum of the anti-government movement. While the protests have largely quieted down since the law was imposed, the opposition had been looking toward the election as a way to revive their cause. The pro-democracy camp had been hoping for big gains in the voting, following their landslide victory last fall in district elections. With many of their most prominent leaders now banned from running, their chances seem less certain. Mr. Yeung, the lawmaker, said the government had failed to show that the election could not go ahead during the pandemic. He cited safety measures adopted by South Korea and Singapore during recent elections. “How on earth can they convince the rest of the world, including Hong Kong people and the international community, that they have no other ulterior motives other than public health concerns?” he said. Ms. Hui, from Notre Dame, compared Beijing’s strategy to Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War.” Beijing, she said, has exploited advantages to defeat its perceived enemies, not just with the security law in Hong Kong, but also in the South China Sea, on China’s border with India and in other contested areas. “The harshness of the law cannot be measured by the number of arrests,” she said, “but by the deterrent effects on silencing anyone who dares to dissent.” Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, Elaine Yu reported from Hong Kong and Steven Lee Myers reported from Seoul.']",
What Can Victorian Schools Teach America About Reopening?,2020-07-31,By Besha Rodell,"['The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email. Every night, we wait for the email. Sometimes it comes in the late afternoon, but many nights it doesn’t hit my inbox until 10 or 11 p.m. Eventually, it arrives, written by a beleaguered school principal letting us know that my son’s high school is still closed. My family is in the same position as thousands of others in Victoria, where around 100 schools are dealing with similar situations. After months of remote learning, year 11 and 12 students in Melbourne returned to the classroom on July 14. For my son, who is in 11th grade, this in-person schooling lasted less than a week — on July 20 we were informed that a student at his school had tested positive for coronavirus and all in-person learning would be suspended while the school was cleaned and contact tracing conducted. As of today, July 31, the school is clean but the contact tracing continues. There has never been a timeline given to parents or students about how long that tracing will take. We wait day-to-day for updates on whether school will resume the next day. The principal waits on the Department of Health to let him know when contact tracing is complete, and the overburdened Department of Health does — I assume — its best, probably with some waiting of its own for coronavirus test results. With debate in the United States raging about whether schools should reopen after the annual summer break, there are some useful lessons in the struggles of our schools in Victoria. An opinion piece in the Times this week asked, “what happens when there is a Covid-19 case in a school?” Well, here in Melbourne, many schools are already answering that question. I spoke to Times education reporter Eliza Shapiro today just as she was finishing up a news brief about the plans drawn up by New York City’s school district — the largest in the U.S. — for reopening. It is one of the only large districts in the country to be attempting in-person learning any time soon, with most major districts opting for distance learning for the foreseeable future. Eliza’s reporting, along with Dana Goldstein, has shown that most large school districts are in danger of major community coronavirus spread if they reopen, but New York is eager to move ahead and the plans Eliza described to me are complex and ambitious, with specific standards for when schools will close down and under what conditions. “It’s really really complicated,” she told me. “We have so many vulnerable kids, so many kids with disabilities, so many homeless kids, so there’s a lot of interest in getting as many kids back in the classroom as possible. But once we actually open — if we open — real life is going to collide with these plans and it’s going to be really difficult.” What the Americans may not fully grasp is what we’ve already learned in Victoria: Plans can disappear quickly when the unpredictability of the virus comes into play. Each case or cluster becomes its own mystery, demanding time and resources while raising anxiety to new levels. To be clear: I place no blame on anyone for my son’s school situation. It’s an overused word in these bizarre times, but the situation is unprecedented and extremely complex. I applaud everyone involved for trying to keep the community as safe as possible. But Victorian schools are in a far better position than many American school systems by almost every metric, and yet things here are messy and unpredictable and often delayed for reasons that are unknown or not fully shared. Just like our nightly ritual of learning on-the-fly what our situation will be the following morning, the most disconcerting thing about this virus is the extreme uncertainty and endurance that it demands. What will tomorrow bring? Or the next day, month and year? I hope what we’re going through can, at the very least, help inform and prepare other parents, students and school districts what their own future may hold.

"In India, a Gay Prince’s Coming Out Earns Accolades, and Enemies",2020-07-31,By Shalini Venugopal Bhagat,"['NEW DELHI — Born into a royal family that once ruled the kingdom of Rajpipla in India, he was raised in the family’s palaces and mansions and was being groomed to take over a dynasty that goes back 600 years. But then he gave an interview that prompted his mother to disown him and set off protests in his hometown, where he was burned in effigy. Since coming out as gay in that 2006 interview, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil has faced a torrent of bullying and threats, and was disinherited by his family for a period. But he has also earned global accolades for his L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy, becoming one of the few gay-rights activists in the world with such royal ties. As part of his efforts, Prince Manvendra, 55, has appeared on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” three times, swapped life stories with Kris Jenner on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and is working to establish a shelter for L.G.B.T.Q. people on his property in the Indian state of Gujarat. He is also working with several aid agencies to prevent the spread of H.I.V. among gay men. Prince Manvendra and his husband, deAndre Richardson, have spent the last few months in lockdown getting the shelter ready. They envision a safe space where those who have been disowned by their families can get back on their feet and learn job skills. “I know how important it is to have a safe space after coming out,” the prince said. Although India abolished the princely order in 1971, the honorary titles are still commonly used for royal descendants, and traditional responsibilities are still carried out. When the prince shared that he was gay in that front-page newspaper interview 14 years ago, it created a storm of mostly negative publicity. It was shocking for a member of an Indian royal family, especially one from the rigidly conservative Rajput warrior clan that once ruled over large parts of northern and central India, to come out so publicly. Being gay was a criminal offense in India under the archaic British law in effect at the time. The law was struck down in 2018. The fallout from his announcement was brutal, beginning with protests in his hometown, Rajpipla, where he was burned in effigy. His mother took out a newspaper advertisement to announce she was disowning him. The government offered him security after he received several death threats, but he turned down the offer and refused to back down. “I decided that I would continue fighting because I have truth on my side,” he said. Prince Manvendra was born in 1965 to Raghubir Singh Gohil, the current honorary maharajah of Rajpipla, and Rukmani Devi Gohil, the daughter of the former maharajah of Jaisalmer. By that time, the era of fabulously rich Indian maharajahs had already waned. His great-grandfather’s ostentatious display of wealth, with stables of racehorses and garages filled with Rolls-Royces (nearly a dozen), was no longer welcome in a newly independent India where socialism, austerity and self-sufficiency were the new mantras. Although Prince Manvendra’s family no longer ruled a kingdom, the old ways still largely prevailed. He spent most of his childhood in his family’s seven-bedroom mansion in Mumbai, staffed by servants who had worked for the family for generations. He barely saw his parents and was raised primarily by the same nanny who had raised his mother. “Until I was 9 or 10, I thought my nanny was my mother,” he said. “I didn’t realize that the glamorous woman who appeared once in a while was actually my mother.” The lack of parental love still wounds him. “Why do parents give birth to children if they don’t want to take care of them?” he said. His childhood was excruciatingly lonely. His only friends were the birds and other animals he rescued as a young child. “I grew up with literally no friends, because I knew I couldn’t invite anyone home,” he said, because he was allowed to socialize only with children from a similar background. He earned a college degree in commerce and accounting and went on to complete law school, although he has never practiced law. In 1991, he married Chandrika Kumari, a princess from the royal family of Jhabua, a match entered into voluntarily, he emphasized. “I was attracted to men but I thought it was just a passing phase,” he said. “I had never been allowed to spend time alone with a girl, and sex before marriage was out of the question.” Being gay was not a possibility that ever crossed his mind, he said, because he knew nothing about it. “Once we got married, it became clear to me that I wasn’t interested in women sexually,” he said. “We were very good friends, we got along very well, but there was no sexual attraction.” The couple called it quits 15 months later, a split that caused an uproar in royal circles. After the divorce, he said, he was wracked with guilt and confused about his sexuality. He moved back to Mumbai, a 26-year-old divorced virgin, and started exploring his sexuality for the first time. “I started reading books and magazines. I saw an article about Ashok Row Kavi and his gay magazine Bombay Dost. I decided to get in touch with him and ask him if I could possibly be gay,” he recalled. Mr. Kavi is a father of India’s gay-rights movement. In 1977, he came out publicly and went on to found Bombay Dost, India’s first gay magazine, in 1990. He founded the Humsafar Trust, the first group to provide health services and advocacy for gay men, in 1994. Mr. Kavi introduced Prince Manvendra to other people in the community and trained him as a counselor. He remembers the young prince as a painfully shy introvert, who was slowly starting to become comfortable with his identity. He said the prince quietly funded the first telephone help line for gay people in India. In 2000, with Mr. Kavi’s encouragement, the prince started the Lakshya Trust in Gujarat to help the gay community there. The work was fulfilling, but as a closeted gay man, the prince said, it became increasingly difficult to do the advocacy work needed for Lakshya. And there was growing pressure to remarry. After he suffered a nervous breakdown in 2002, his psychiatrist convinced him the first step in his recovery was to come out to his parents. It was the beginning of a long and bitter ordeal. “My parents were in an absolute state of denial,” Prince Manvendra said. “They declared that science must have a cure for my condition, a surgery perhaps or shock therapy to cure my ‘disease.’” But every doctor his parents consulted told them the same thing — homosexuality was not a disease or a mental disorder. His parents finally gave up on medical science and decided to try religion instead. For three years, they took him to dozens of religious leaders around the country. “Ashok told me to cooperate with them completely,” the prince said. “To let them be satisfied that they’d tried their best.” There were financial consequences to his coming out. He says that he was removed from several family businesses and that his mother threatened to persuade the government to cancel funding for the Lakshya Trust. “I finally reached a point in my life where I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. “I decided to tell the whole world.” Over the past 14 years, the once-shy royal has grown accustomed to the spotlight and become a vocal activist for the gay rights movement. Apart from his work with the Lakshya Trust, he is a founding member of the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health and is an ambassador consultant of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. “He was living a very troubled life, under a lot of pressure,” said Chirantana Bhatt, a close friend. “But now it’s a life of pride, in the true sense.” He has also found love. In 2013, he married Mr. Richardson, an American he met online in 2009, in the United States. The couple live on an estate in Gujarat given to the prince by his father. His modest brick house there is a far cry from the opulent palace of his ancestors, but he says he could not be happier. His father, the maharajah, acknowledged in an interview that it was difficult for the family to come to terms with his son’s sexuality and the constant media attention on the family. “But it’s his decision,” the maharajah said. His relationship with his mother remains frosty, but other members of the family have been supportive, he says. His grandmother, on her deathbed, expressed her happiness that he had found a partner to share his life with. Prince Manvendra is cautiously optimistic about the future. He is not sure if he will become the next honorary maharajah of Rajpipla. “I have left it to my family members,” he said. “I would prefer to keep working for my cause because the role of maharajah comes with a lot of responsibilities and duties that would divert me from my activism.”']",Prince Manvendra’s journey from an excruciatingly lonely child to a global L.G.B.T.Q. advocate included death threats and disinheritance.
